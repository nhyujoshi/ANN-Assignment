0	Watched since the beginning, I can't watch any more. Drama series should be a place to escape from politics and opinions, not a place to have it shoved down your throat...... ugh.
0	Used to be heavily into this series. When season 1 came on TV and I caught notice of it I bought all the books and have since been heavily into the lore. Sadly the two last seasons have completly ruined this series for me.The writing is horrible and it really shows that D&D are nothing but frauds, as soon as they ran out of book material the show went south fast! I'd love to rate it higher but season 8 is possible the worst that have been sent on tv in recent history (and I used to watch the walking dead...).
0	Lost everything that made it special. I wish that they would cancel it and stop dragging it out.
0	"It's funny that a 10 hour ""mini"" series is actually longer than the 10 episode ""normal"" series of 2024. And this is the main problem with this show, it was ""modernized"" for ""modern"" audiences. Something a show about 17th century feudal Japan does not need.We have all the tropes of modern shows - cliff hangers, extremely long and pointless establishing shots, ""witty"" dialogue, gray and brown tones for ""realism"", and pointless changes to the original story for no apparent reason.Do yourself a favor and watch the 1980s show instead. It's superior in pretty much every way, and was actually shot in Japan, unlike the new one that was shot in Canada for some reason."
2	You shouldn't forget one thing while watching: most of us are watching from the comfort of a sane mind free of major trauma of the like. If you make it to episode 6, you get the insight into Donny's mind and that might relieve you from the frustration that engulfs you every time Donny doesn't tell Martha off, shout at her, block her, report her, or even beat her to pulp. That's what we feel we would do, but Donny isn't us, and there are plenty of Donnys out there.Apart from being a good showing of a stalking situation especially with the usual gender roles reversed, it gives a great representation of how a traumatized person relates to any kind of attention - or dare I say love - they can scoop up.Definitely a very hard watch, not only because of depictions of sexual violence or of downspiral into drugs and self-destruction, but also because of this intricate form of self-harm that I'm afraid numerous people live in - at least in their own unique way.If you take away anything from this show, it should be understanding and acceptance, that people don't always react the way you would and they don't deserve blame for it. If anything, this should put a new twist to victim shaming and give realization that we don't know the full story. We almost never know the whole story.Spiced with some serious acting, strong imagery and powerful music, this show hits hardest when you lay in bed at night and think about how all this, in fact, happened in real life.Balancing on the border of a documentary, this is a strong one, a tough one, and one that stays with you.
2	"Its about a guy called Thomas Ripley who goes to Italy to convience his supposed friend to go back to America and later ended up killing and impersonating him The first thing i would like to address, is all the negative reviews. Most of them compares this show to the ""Talented Mr. Ripley"" movie and argues Andrew Scott is too old to play Ripley. I beg to differ! I normally like to judge the show as it is, the reality of what it intends to portray and if it delivers on that.Who is Tom Ripley? And How is he supposed to be portrayed?. Ripley is a con artist, who can forge passports, create fake IDs, murder in his convience, lie to the police and impersonate people. This type of experties needs years to accumulate and perfect and thats why it makes more sense if Ripley is an older guy who looks like is in his late forties than Matt's twentiesh look.The tv show took time to show us who Ripley was before he went to Europe which justifies what he does when he reaches there. There is something so cold about Andrew's Ripley persona that hits you as you watch the show that justifies him commiting those murders. But Matt Damon's Ripley is abit different, he kinda looks naive and innocent. Like a kid who is learning to be con artist but doesnt have the experties to kill and evade police all over Europe.Other characters have more depth and personality than in the movie. Talk about Marge, in the Tv show she is made to be smart and curious. Just not some girl who is madly in love with her cheating boyfriend and follows him around like in the movie. And this serves its purpose in the movie as her curiosity justifies why she would be so curious about the truth on accusation of murder made against her fiance and Ripley's intentions. Dickie in the movie was more interesting than in the show thou. A guy who living in Europe without working depending on his dad's money is probably supposed to have charisma, he is supposed to be irresponsible and fun. The Italian inspector who was on Dickies case was better in the show. He managed to give you that annoying aura of detectives as they investigate stuff intellegently.The tv show also took sometime in crafting justified sequence of events. In the boat scene, Ripley trying to hide the body and burn evidence makes sense. The murder of Freddie and trying to evade the police. You can feel the sheer chill as walls close on Ripley.People also did have the problem with black and white cinematography. I agree, it didnt strike me at first but as the show precided i came to understand its purpose. It fits the genre ( murder mystery) and the period which the story takes placeThe dialogue was okay as in it wasnt cringy and it befits the time the story takes place and the ethinicity of the characters It is a great show, i highly recommend it so ignore the negative review and enjoy."
0	I love the games and the Fallout universe, but from a story and character perspective, this was terrible. I found myself disinterested whenever the two main characters weren't on screen. Maximum, in particular, was unbearable without the others. I'm eager for a fan edit that removes this character and most of the ghouls' backstory, which was mostly pointless.Fallout has explored Vault-Tec's history in many other ways that didn't just spoon-feed us information and instead allowed us to piece things together. This approach felt like poor planning or storytelling.While it was great to see the world, the locations seemed to be taken directly from the games with nothing new.In short, it's a lot of fan service and not much else.
2	Am on my second episode. I must say that I know I will finish this, character creation is spot on. Reminds me of breaking bad with the cast really likeable all of them. Can see myself binging on this. Funny, good budget, likeable cast, dosn't hold back, love it well done
0	"Andrew Scott is an amazing actor but, they got it wrong here as Tom Ripley. Tom Ripley is a 25 year old who is charming yet slick and slippery. He is the protagonist and antagonist and that's why he is so alluring however, they missed the mark here. I don't know what they were thinking casted Scott when there are so many actors that fit better and would be more convincing. Also, to have us believe he is ""friends"" with Dickie who's aged in his twenties is unbelievable. For Dickie to want to hang out with someone that's not around his age is also unbelievable. It's cringy honestly. Lastly, Scott looks nothing like Johnny Flynn and somehow he'll get away with being his age when he's in his upper 40's!!! LOL. So to have Tom take over Dickie's life is unjust as well. Hard fail in this all together. If they would have casted Tom correctly this would have been perfect to watch. Most of the story telling was close to the book and I did enjoy how it was filmed. I didn't like how Tom freely told Dickie right away his dad sent him too. But I could deal with the little issues. I unfortunately couldn't continue to watch trying to force myself into believing it and this was definitely a big let down. Andrew Scott as Tom Ripley?!? Oh and the book takes place in 1955....they didn't get that right either. SMH."
2	When I saw the title on the Disney channel I assume it's one of those mock Asian war drama we always see on the screen with fake mock Asian token actors like we always see. I can not be more wrong. The richness in characters is built on real Japanese actors who are world class actors in the film/Tv industry and the depiction of the religious and political tension is something I have not seen on a main stream service for long time. Not to mention how rare we get to hear Japanese spoken with majority of the air time on an English language channel. This authentic Japanese/Englsih drama is exceptionally well made and has the potential to lead the white audience into a new realm of Asian western fusion genre. I expect some awards to be won shortly.
1	Everything ties together so nicely of present and past.The characters are built just nicely, really good choice of songs,the juxtaposition of old songs with future world was humourous and ironic.Excessive Capitalism is explored till the point of god like decisions being taken.There was Instances of bad cgi but this was over taken by the good designs of the gulper,giant roaches,and the beautiful western accent of the ghoul.An energy and resources control is still being waged by various factions vying for power.The show was beautiful executed though we would love if more creaturess were shown,more of those giant machine suits being used and explanation for what powers them or where those ospreys wer getting their fuel from.Each episode was an hour long, it's obvious lots of thought went to it,this is Loki style writing and we are all here for it.
1	"They said ""Expect the unexpected"" before the launch of the season 8, thereby hrilling everyone's bones to the core. I assume when you say something like this to anyone, you say it with promises that you will not get disappointed at all, but the sentence coined by GOT team has proven correct, it was ""Unexpected"" at all with broken hearts of million of fans. I made the last moment change, ratings from 6 to 5!!!!"
2	"Walking in I was sceptical. Having been really only into the fallout universe since fallout 3, I wasn't a purist. The budget and effects whilst not ""perfect"" are certainly not janky enough to detract from the visual spectacle. The characters are unique and flawed, there so far seems to me an absence of ""the message"" and it's a good , fun watch. Is it a mind blowing experience? No, is it a fun hour watching some post apocalyptic mayhem? Yes certainly. There is no absence of gore and a plethora of nostalgia. For me that wasn't enough not to like and it is probably one of the best ""game to screen"" adaptations so far. For me above ""The Last Of Us""."
1	The Rookie is at best an enjoyable diversion. I frankly didn't think it would be renewed for a second season. Often it can't seem to figure out if it is a comedy or a drama. The current ongoing plot with super-villain Rosalind is getting REALLY tiresome and the spin-off series, The Rookie Feds, is just plain silly. Please don't air any tie-ins which will require me to watch The Rookie Feds as rather than have to do that I will instead stop watching The Rookie! Another super-silly plot involving look-alike characters was cartoonish and a complete turnoff. I would like to enjoy this series; the characters are relatable and show development and I like them all but the increasingly silly plots and the tiresome Rosalind thing have me about ready to stop watching the show.
0	The season felt like a bad anime that ran out of source material so they make up some really strange and really bad way of ending the story that makes 0 sense at all to the seasons before it.DO NOT let these writers get there hands on anouther book movie or series EVER AGAIN.They gave the middle finger to the whole plot they set up in prior seasons.
0	I have been looking forward to this immensely since I first read of its production. I'm a huge fan of the novels and have read them repeatedly over the years as I have grown older and taken a different view of the characters each time. I am a fan of the earlier adaptation of the first novel as I am of various other adaptations of the character, all bringing something different from the pages of Patricia's novels. What was this though? All playfulness and excitement was removed and the wily title character reduced to a monotone bore. As for the supporting cast that was even worse. No chemistry, no motives, no engagement in what was happening at all. The direction was absolutely foul! I have no issue with the black and white approach but what was with the constant slide show of repeated images? It was like watching an amateur film school adaptation. I actually hope they don't adapt any of the other novels because they don't deserve this. The young cad turned into an eight part high end car commercial and just so there is no confusion here that isn't a complement in the slightest.
0	This was never a great show, but it was a good enough relaxing and chill cop show, like Castle... it was interesting to watch the relationships between T. O and Rookie, on top of that a 40 yo old police rookie is actually an interesting premise, even tho it felt like every episode something reaaaaally high profile and unlikely happened, and I rather they kept it casual and simple, focus on the relationship while doing real police work, I never felt like dropping the show... what the hell happened... Tim was my favorite character by far, I loved Chen, and Nolan was very likable and relatable. Why did they have to ruin it... My favorite cop show is The Mentalist, and I was hoping this one was at least good enough to finish...
1	"Despite having magic, dragons and supernatural creatures in it, it was much more plot- and character-driven. Most of the charme came from smart conversations, like in Jackie Brown(imho the best Tarantino movie, yet underrated because it doesn't have much action).One can say that I liked the show because it was different. It didn't mind to break with conventions, it didn't pander to what the majority expected and it didn't show you everything (like the battles), which made the few scenes with some sword fights all the more powerful.Then came season 4 and season 5. The show started to slip and fast. Basically with the death of Tywin Lannister, it said goodbye to everything that made it once great. The 2 best schemers(Varys and Littlefinger) who could have a show of their own and set in motion 90% of the plot left King's Landing and hardly had any role in the show anymore. The interesting characters with edges and flaws were killed off because the creators didn't like them(Stannis). The way that was done was an insult to anyone who kept watching after that.The big threat that we should worry about were always the zombie-like creatures up north. Who are they? Where do they come from? Why do they want to kill everyone? Don't hope for answers. The ""big threat"" is dealt with in one episode, of course without answers."
1	Season 3 primarily consists of political messaging. Feels weird, false, gratuitous. Tough to watch.
0	"Regardless of the story, i couldn't stand most of the acting/writing. Most characters behaved like stressed teenagers and the dialogues felt very forced at times, and with a lot of misplaced humor & weird character interactions. The story revolves around scientists, however they are portrayed as if they are high school students, both in how they behave and what they talk about and every apect of scientific nature is dumbed down for the audience (""These damn scientists be doing their science n' stuff"") . I only found the writing and acting of the chinese speaking actors convincing, which made this hard to watch."
1	"If this wasn't the biggest deception in TV series history, then I don't know what is. This show rode on the idea of a Shogun. In Japanese folklore, a Shogun was a very powerful military commander who was second to only the Emperor and he commanded a large army. And if you controlled the army, you almost nearly are in control of the country. So when this dude, Toranaga, who comes from a long line of Shoguns, is exiled and on the verge of being killed by the then rulers of Japan, we are taking on this journey of discovery. Will he become Shogun and take on these rulers? And if he won't, then what will be do?After a long wait which spanned 9 episodes of boring, long speech, great cinematography and excellent acting we are presented with a poorly written, incredibly dissatisfying ending. Honestly it felt like we, the viewers, were the ones the trick was played on. There was no Shogun, there was no grand battle, there was no ""crimson sky"", there was no justice served, and the only deaths were those of his loyal followers who sacrificed themselves, all for what?!If not for the amazing scenes, cinematography and acting, I would have given this a 3/10. The story just sucked big time."
1	Loved Nathan Fillion from Castle and the first few years years of this show was pretty decent. But once they started to bring in the FBI spin off with a character who dresses like a Wive's Club Mom instead of a Federal Agent. She'd never be allowed to show that much cleavage when every other female agent is in a pant suit.This last episode where they make a gun carrying guy the bad guy because he pulls his weapon is more typical Hollywood crap people are sick of watching coming into their shows.As mentioned by other viewers, the constant love connections is as bad as watching Grey's Anatomy where every one is sleeping w/a coworker. This isn't Love Connection. It's supposed to be a Police Drama. Stick to that.
0	"Title: ""Disappointing Series: A Missed Opportunity""As a dedicated fan of the genre, I was eagerly anticipating the release of shogun. However, after investing countless hours into watching it, I can confidently say that it fell far short of expectations.Firstly, the plot was convoluted and poorly executed. Instead of a cohesive narrative that drew me in, I found myself struggling to follow the numerous subplots that seemed to go nowhere. The pacing was inconsistent, with episodes dragging on without any meaningful development, only to rush through important moments later on.Furthermore, the characters lacked depth and failed to resonate with me. They felt like mere caricatures, with little to no growth throughout the series. I found it difficult to empathize or connect with any of them, which made it challenging to invest in their journeys.On top of that, the acting left much to be desired. Dialogue delivery felt forced and unnatural, making it difficult to immerse myself in the story. It was evident that the actors were struggling to breathe life into poorly written lines, resulting in performances that fell flat.Lastly, the production quality was subpar. From the mediocre special effects to the uninspired cinematography, it was clear that corners were cut in the production process. Scenes that were supposed to be climactic fell short due to lackluster visual effects, leaving me underwhelmed and disappointed.Overall, shogun was a missed opportunity. With a more coherent plot, well-developed characters, stronger performances, and higher production values, it could have been something truly special. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver on almost every level, leaving me feeling like I wasted my time."
0	Being an FX show, I thought this would be for an english speaking audience. The small amount of english that is spoken in by british actors with strong accents. The rest is all Japanese with english subtitles. Why networks think we want to read TV instead of watch it is beyond me. If I wanted to read it, I would buy the book (which is always better than the movie or TV)! No matter how good the show is, many of us will not watch it due to the almost total subtitling. I didn't even get through half of the first episode, and like many, will not watch any more. Too bad that FX has so little regard for such a large portion of its viewing audience.
1	This was an amazing show! Everything was beautifully written, the characters were intriguing. The plot was captivating. But only 8 episodes? Why? There was enough to make this a full season. Now, how long do I have to wait for season 2? 3 years for just another 8 episodes? Idk...seems like a lot of build up just to be disappointed by such a long wait for half a season.Now the obligatory gibberish to make the character requirement Lalalalalalalalalalalallalalalalamalamamamamlalalalalamalamamlalalalalalalalalalalalallalalalalalalalalalalslsmsmeijskskakakakkalalalalalalalalalalalalalalaaamamamsm.
0	"I am a sucker for slow evolving plots, but this was asinine.ABOUT MY REVIEWS:I do not include a synopsis of the film/show -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating). For Lifetime Movies for Chicks (LMFC), drop the above scale by 3 notches. A 6 is excellent and 7 almost unattainable."
2	A group of scientists discover a phenomena that threatens humanity itself, a sequence of events that were put into action some forty years ago in China.There's so much hype surrounding this series right now, it's one of those shows everyone is talking about, but I've been here before, this unlike many however is worthy of the hype.I have read the book (albeit some years back,) and was worried how on Earth they'd adapt it, such a complex story, but the truth is, they've done a fine job, it's definitely heavily edited, something that gives this show pace.I enjoyed episodes one and two, although I fully got into it during the third, the highlight for me was episode five, Judgment Day, it's incredible.I have a feeling this show will soldier on a little longer, I only hope they don't dilute it down too much.There are some incredible special effects throughout, in particular, there's that sequence on the boat in episode 5 that is incredible, perhaps the highlight of the series.Very well acted throughout, I personally really enjoyed the performances of Liam Cunningham, Jess Hong and Benedict Wong, there are so many, as well as some unexpected guest appearances.A very fine adaptation of what is a wonderfully complex and imaginative story.8/10.
2	The black and white format also made it very in keeping with the period depicted . Sometimes the true colors can distract you from the essence of the story. Italy is depicted very effectively with the motor cars and fashions of the day . I was sorry I missed the little town in my earlier travels, until I realized how many stairs there were . Wish I could have seen Venice in the 60s , I can remember when I was there in the 80s there was an abundance of decaying paint on the buildings, so well hidden in the black and white format . Such a shame it's over run with tourists today ,to such an extent they are thinking of introducing a cover charge and limited tourist numbers to the city .
0	Best: right up to the point they had source material Worst: As soon as they ran out of booksOne of the best (essential) character on the show, Logic, died after season 4-5. The creators D&D (short for dumb and dumber) are apparently a couple of talent-less hacks, they hardly have anything original on their CV.
2	"Shogun has clawed back some pride in television series production, presenting a truly compelling and intricate historical period-epic offering that has clearly done its homework in getting the accuracy and details spot-on. Shogun sports astonishingly good colour grading, mesmerising performances, and excellent costuming throughout.Depicting the feudal period of the saber-rattling Japans, political crossfire abounds as the far-flung Christian world meets the isolationist honour-bound Japanese, the culture shock depicted onscreen is oftentimes revelatory, sometimes funny, and occasionally chilling. It is a title that evokes an age when Japan was separated from the rest of the world, not just by the roiling East Asian seas, but by religion, economics, and, most importantly, culture.This is a clinical, mature, and sober outing from Disney, and most certainly a world-class effort in exploring the rich world of feudal Japan through period dramatisation. Retaining dialogue in Japanese with subtitles and casting Japanese actors are hallmarks of its faithfulness to representing an authentic setting. This thrillingly realises James Clavell's bestselling book for the screen.There have been justified complaints about Shogun not featuring the lingua franca of that era (Portuguese) with English being oddly referred to as ""Portuguese"". At that time, Portuguese was used for communications between Europeans and Japanese (the Portuguese were the first to arrive in 1543). However, a fully accurate portrayal of the story would be entirely in Portuguese and Japanese, and all of Shogun would have to include subtitles. I think they were mistaken to not have some characters speaking subtitled Portuguese, but clearly made the decision on grounds of accessibility for English speakers. I don't feel it undermines the story enough to be a major issue.8.5/10."
0	One star is a little harsh, but only because I'm comparing it to the original, which is much better. This new series has beautiful and updated photography but lacks the compelling depth, acting and superior story telling of the first. The 1980 version was an amazing study in culture and politics while this one feels more like a Transformer movie. Perhaps if you haven't seen the first, you'll not know what you're missing and can enjoy it for what it is. Trying to remake a classic is hard I applaud the artists' efforts, I realize it's a different telling of the story. I've seen remakes that I thought were good, and with that being said, for me, this one just doesn't hit the mark.
1	Started off so well. Season one was great , season two not bad, season 3 is just a joke. Stupid storylines trying to be more a of a comedy than cop show.
1	"It's not the ""soapiness"" that makes the show aggravating its the inaccuracies especially when talking about really important things. It's like the writers want to bring up these social issues but don't have experience or an education on what they actually are. It's seriously like the show is written by people who haven't met other people. All of the characters are incredibly insecure which ALWAYS affects their patients health- these may be the worst fake surgeons on the planet. I would genuinely be afraid to enter this hospital because I'd probably be killed. Not because anything is actually wrong with me but because the doctors are just mad at each-other. There are so many times that the best doctor in the show, Shepard, almost kills his patient because he refuses to listen to his wife or his residents. And it's not because their wrong it's always because they've offended him in some really minor way. The accuracy of the series is overridden by the need to create drama. It makes me uncomfortable that young people are expected to take lessons from a show that doesn't have a understanding on what it's teaching. This show would probably be better as a rom-com as it seems to miss the nail when it's tries to create convincing drama. It's a fun watch though!! It reminds me of a E! reality tv series. I physically can't stop watching though so obviously the writers are doing something right."
2	Grey's Anatomy is a surprisingly addictive show. The plot lines are an interesting blend of soap opera, drama, and comedy--it's not really like anything else, but at the same time, it occasionally feels pedestrian. However, it's very well done--good writing, great acting, and well directed. Sandra Oh stands out for her comic timing, but the entire cast is superb. It's not as grave as ER, but is just as compelling. Also, it's a little more accessible than ER and some of the more serious medical dramas. The show is definitely worth catching--if you can't watch it when it airs, TiVo it or rent the first season DVD. It's well worth the time spent! It's great for marathon viewings!
1	I loved this show, but since season 3 it has become too political.Why do shows insist on doing this? Leave the politics to the politicians. TV shows are too one-sided in their portrayal of current views, they go after the popular view, they do not give both sides.
1	As someone who didn't read the books, I have mixed feelings.While the first half of the season gradually built up to a great catastrophe, the second half could have been condensed and saved for a second season.Some of the characters, like Auggie, Jin and Ye, are very interesting to watch but a good few of them feel very unserious for a good portion of the time, so it broke lots of the tension and seriousness I enjoyed about the show.There are many, many small plot holes surrounding the Santis and their purpose. Certain pieces of their story and mission contradict or go without explanation. I'm sure the books are probably more precise about this, but for one I didn't enjoy that this story is primarily about humans being pitted against each other in seemingly shallow, emotion-driven conflict when these characters were introduced as powerful scientists and leaders. At one point, the Santis display their immense power and control over humanity with their technology and are nothing short of terrifying. A psychotic, one-note zealot isn't enough to create an interesting villain and we need to expand on this.The highs are really high and I appreciated that. The story's plot is strong and original, but rushed. It wasn't a pain to watch, but I wasn't exactly satisfied by the end of it either.
0	Here's my impression after the 2nd episode. They spent so much money on Bethesda rights and Johnny Cash music that they couldn't hire an adequate writer. Bu dum chhhh.It's a hodge podge of uncertain tone and poor character writing. The script and storyline are sloppy.I've played Fallout a bit, and this world is a good aesthetic copy so far. If that's ALL I wanted, I'd just play the game. I'll give that point to them anyways.It had some promise in the first episode. A bit meh, but not all pilots are winners. The characters were introduced, and a story began. Bare minimum set up really.Highlight: Kyle McLaughlin. I love the guy. But I didn't care one bit about his character.The second episode is embarrassing to watch. The music made me cringe and there was no logic in the fight scene. Did you hire Neil Breen as an editor? A yodeler losing their voice on the soundtrack? A literal child as the director?It feels like it wants to be the mandalorian (sp?). But instead of being an appropriately paced adventure, it punches you in the face with lame violence and awkward savagery. And not the good kind of awkward, because it's neither funny nor charming. I didn't laugh once.It's a shame, really. With better writing, this could be really fun! It could be a fish out of water story, with an overly optimistic main protagonist in a harsh world. But it relies too much on aesthetic of the video game without making an interesting story to go along with it.Whatever it's doing, it's shaky. I'd rather watch a show with solid characters and story development.I'll update if I can even keep watching this. But honestly I'd rather just play the video game. I don't have time for sloppy memberberry shows.
2	Fallout is even better than I expected. It's up there as one of the best video game adaptations ever. Fallout takes pace a couple hundred years after a nuclear apocalypse and people have to live in underground bunkers to protect themselves. There is a world going on above full of radiation that's created mutants and a lawless society full of evil people and violence. All the people living in these underground communities are forced to come up and live. Ella Purcell stars as Lucy, one of the people who's never been above ground before and wasn't prepared for the lawless society it has become. One of the most underrated actors ever in Walton Goggins steals the show once again as a mutant bandit. This series is just flat out awesome.
2	It's very attractive interesting drama that made me wait for it to watch from week to week specially that lovely sweet boy Dr.O'Malley ....... i won't say more about him because my man will kill me if he knew i said so ;'-)) The ups & downs, the cheering & letdowns in these people's lives is similar to what any of us may face by accident or what may interfere in his way & the life should move on... The sense of humor is classy & the perfect dose of laughs, love, lust & heartbreaks is all classy, i even loved or maybe wished to be a doctor my self ;'D Well done for the whole crew & go forward i wish u all for more success in this project & yet of the rest to come.
0	The choice of actors is bad, especially the main actress E. Gonzalez is a total failure for this type of series. She's just a pretty face and nothing more, she's completely unconvincing as a serious and highly intelligent scientist (she's just really bad at acting because she doesn't know how to act the right emotions). This is not helped by the uneven screenplay, which oscillates between interesting, already seen and stupid. A lot of theses are forced and stretched, and the scene with stopping the Doomsday ship with nano-fibers is completely unnecessary and illogical (it was possible to get hold of the data disk in a hundred other ways). All over the planet, people went wild and started killing each other because aliens will come in 400 years?! And smart scientists believe that aliens are not capable of lying and deceiving? WTF? I seriously wonder what goes on in the minds of the screenwriters today. This series is kind of a bad mix of Terminator, The Matrix, The Truman Show and Star Trek. Could and should be better and more intelligent if they aimed at adults.
1	Just watched the second episode of season 3, and it feels weird that they have to make the girl say thanks to the man sitting in her car... And this episode keeps underemphasizing crimes... It made it sounded like people don't have to be responsible for their own behaviors...
0	From the team that bought you GOT, but this was in my opinion a fail.Sure some GOT cast make appearances, but they can't save this slow burn and lack of energy this series brings.There is nothing really making you want to come back and watch each episode, no cliff hanger or ohh what's going to happen moment.It's slow burn with little to no real answers 4 episodes in. The time chopping get annoying and yet also doesn't help answer any solid questions. It's lacking story and plot and over arching theme, much like the back end of GOT, just lacking solid story telling that keeps the watcher engaged.Is disappointing as I wanted to enjoy this and buy into it, but I can't it's missing that GOT buy in that something extra.
0	Used to be a great series to watch to escape this horrific society we've created.Now with S17, politics and racism managed to squeeze itself in here too, and made it exponentially worse, even insulting at times..The Webber/Bailey dynamic used to be my absolute favorite, and even those characters got strangled by the politic agenda the writers seem to impose on the audience. Absolutely shameless..
0	How can you introduce so many things into the world while still not really explaining a single one of them. This first episode which should have set the tone for the rest of the series just threw many concepts of the Fallout universe at the viewer's face without even taking two seconds to elaborate.What are these bunkers? Who build them? How did the people get there? What are the Brothers of Steel and why should we care? Why are there these metal giants? What is the enclave? Who are those raiders? What happened to bunker 32? ...I get it that these questions may be answered later, but I don't feel like continuing when not even a single thing has been properly established in over one hour.
1	I've really enjoyed GoT as a whole. Not everything has been perfect, but most shows are like that, and this is not your average TV-show.. This is an extremely rare genre - a dark fantasy show, i'm willing to cut them some slack. It's too bad about S8 though, i even liked the previous, rather fast paced season (which many people despised). Episode 4 of S8 really ruined a lot i think - it's overall sloppy and just plain dumb, very little effort and thought was put into it. You can tell the creators just got tired of it but continued due to it still making the $$$. We never asked for this.
0	Im a big fan of Japanese Arms and Armor, but this new story Im not.I tried to watch episode 1 and it completely failed for me with lots of fast small scenes.Lots of scenes was sooooo stupid that I took my self laughing. Why would a samurai risk his life for the Spanish guy? And then try to commit Seppuku and then saves him self when he get new rope. Sooo stupid.All acting is very poor and no one I care for.The music is soooo off.The guy playing Toranaga is sooo weak and not a good actor.All filmed in Canada with lots of CGI and green screen. Lots of closeup with blurry bagground.I was really looking forward to this new edition, but Im not gonna see the next 9 episodes, I cant take it serious.
0	While I was so excited for this series, being a lover of the original Talented Mr. Ripley movie, I was very pleased with the black and white cinematography and some of the new locations shown.However, the acting is so boring and flat, the episodes are unnecessarily screeched out leaving important details of the book out that tie important events. The second part is the acting, the only character I enjoyed dies early (Dicky), the rest fall so short, Marge does not reflect any good or bad emotions as her character is so flat, almost invisible. Tom is trying to hard to look the part, he does not even show his romantic affection for Dickie on this adaptation. I am not even sure, why the script is so poor and simplistic on every scene, the essence of the book is lost completely. It was painful to watch. I wish the writer would done better and the director would of paid more attention to the acting.
1	"I just finished this series. The writers took the goofiness of the games and copy/pasted it over into the show, expecting game goofiness during horrific events to translate well over to show goofiness during horrific events. This is a similar flavor as the ""horror comedy,"" which I think is an abomination, save a few rare examples. Like during a massacre, one of the vault leaders is more concerned about the caterers bringing out the jello too early. I mean, he's literally being chased by a machete wielding maniac when he says this. That's the kind of mood-killing cringe that peppers through this show. You know that feeling where you get invested in a mediocre show? And you know there's better things to watch out there, but you aren't invested in those; you're invested in this mediocre show, and you know it's not going to get better, but too bad, you're invested. That's what watching Fallout felt like.The backgrounds, effects, and general world building is pretty cool, and definitely captures that Fallout vibe. I give it a 7 because of the nostalgia, but if I hadn't played the games then I imagine this would be a 5 or 6."
2	"It is slow burn and sometimes doesn't deliver the story clearly. It also little bit amusing in first two episodes. I read the book and there are new main characters (that only one scientist developed to five scientists). It is good for the story, so the series not that monotone. In my opinion, it should ended at episode five and the rest of series could be in season two. The closing of episode five made me shiver, not that many TV series could do that.Note: I might have missed this, but why the word ""Trisolarian"" didn't appear in the show? The word repeated in the book though, for naming the Alien."
0	"I recently watched a couple episodes and was appalled. The writing was complete trash and fantasy. The show lacks complete realism and it's apparent the writers neither know anything about actual police work or actual policies. They certainly don't understand such things as ""hazing"", hostile work environments, policies, Officer safety, or undercover operations. Their show is complete BS. It is know wonder citizens have a complete misunderstanding as to what police work is all about and how officers interact with one another. The scene where the young female officer working undercover is kidnapped by co-Workers is laughable at worst and tragic at best. I have spent decades teaching undercover operations and found this particular episode utterly ridiculous. Not to mention the two co-workers would have been indicted on Federal charges for violation of civil rights, kidnapping and torture. She would as become a multi millionaire after she got done suing the city and the Department. Just a side note to the total out of touch uninformed writers on this show. There is no drug case etc worth the life of an officer. To write such C@ap giving the impression officers work undercover with no regard for their safety is complete fiction and a disservice to all the men and women who do the job. Complete Trash...."
2	"Baby Reindeer starts off like almost any other streaming true crime story does; with a compelling premise, flashy editing, and the promise of something greater. The story of Donny (Richard Gaad - playing a version of himself) and his stalker, Martha (Jessica Gunning) is by itself inherently interesting. But it's the auto-bigraphical, raw emotional exploration that Baby Reindeer becomes that I really fell enjoyed.It's a show that isn't afraid to ask tough and complicated questions, and come up with uneasy and often taboo answers. It's a show that reminds you why the long form nature of miniseries is quite possibly the best way to explore people and their complicated interior and exterior lives. It's a show buoyed by fantastic editing, performances, and writing.Richard Gaad is truly remarkable in this show, in what becomes an increasingly difficult watch as it goes on, knowing that a lot of this stuff is based on his own experiences. It's almost like sitting in on a therapy session and the show invites you to not just ""root"" for his character, but question him. Interrogate him. Hold him accountable. He certainly does and if self-deprecation isn't your thing, you'll most likely hate this show.Jessica Gunning represents the part of the show I think most people will enjoy more, the more conventional aspect of the story, and my God, does she deliver. Martha is a tour-de-force in this show; a perplexing, fascinating, and sometimes terrifying character who will immediately shut up any person who assumes that it's ""impossible"" for men to be abused. She herself is treated with a surprising level of empathy and care and her presence is everywhere in this show, even when she isn't on screen.I've seen some people complain that this show needed to be funnier, and I really disagree with that. It has the characteristically dry and sardonic humour associated with the United Kingdom; I think it's probably one of the best examples of how *different* British humour is from American humour. I also feel like that stand-up scenes brilliantly reflect that old adage: ""in the US, the audience laughs to help the comedian out. In the UK, the audience needs you to earn that laugh.""I do think the show suffers from some pacing issues, with it packing more than it needed to into the final episode to finish everything off. There are a lot of threads that I think could've been explored more and some questions that I wish we got some answers to, particularly regarding Martha.But, I can't deny that Baby Reindeer really evokes the feeling of a great auto-biographical novel put to screen. Even Donny's narration - something that typically doesn't work in film - really adds a lot of texture and context to everything we see. This is a series that needed it, and that's it's great to see that aspect of the story done well.Best Episode: Four. I mean, come on. It's a brilliantly done, incredibly powerful episode that really transforms the rest of the show.Worst Episode: Six. I just felt this one felt like a filler episode, and while cute, could've been a bit longer and given us more for the finale."
1	It use to be my favorite show by far and i never thought that could change,but it did.Last(8)season i watched only once but all the seasons before that i have seen 3 times,except the season 7,which i saw twice.Thank god that i did,because now i won't watch the show again.You really mess it up with the last season.
0	Am I the only one who thinks it's ridiculous when they call rookies boo??? I know lots if cops and have never heard them use that word EVER!!!! Stupid
2	I have really been one of those who have watched Grey's Anatomy since its inception, watching year after year each new season, and it really does not disappoint me, they always manage to maintain the personal drama, medical drama, despite adding new characters one always achieves connection With the new ones, it has very rarely been achieved. This last season, manages to introduce a new group of residents with characteristics similar to the originals but each one with its own essence, making the viewer make a connection with them and their stories despite many of the original characters having already left, it also managed to bring old characters for example like Addison. This season covers many interesting topics, for example Alzheimer's disease, anxiety, fentanyl problematic, sexual education, safe abortion (a very important topic in this season closely associated with all the problems seen in the USA), problems with residency programs, sd of bourn out in health personnel, the poor salaries of residents and their terrible conditions, changes in medical teaching, teamwork. My least favorite and most annoying character is Simone, I think she is very selfish, Benson has a lot of potential but I would like to know more about her story, Jules reminds us of Izzie (but her character still needs a little more development), Lucas is the one who worked the most due to being a Shepard, the best new character is Yasuda with a very strong personality reminding us of Yang. Shonda always makes us afraid when there are airplane scenes and someone can't be missing who escapes from a wedding. The season finale reminds us of those old endings where you are left in shock since you didn't expect it, already wanting to see the new season, to find out what happened to the characters. Despite the years, Grey's Anatomy has much more to tell.
0	"Being a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was excited to check out this new hyped up sci-fi series. It starts of really well and hooked me right away. The first few episodes build so much intrigue and speculation.Then the show grinds nearly to a halt. There is little to no story progression. We focus on ridiculously annoying subplots. I could feel myself caring less by the minute.The final few episodes ramp back up with more frequent major plot points, but it's too late. The show already lost me. And there are a bunch of things that don't really make sense. I don't think I'll be checking out season 2.(1 viewing, 4/15/2024)SPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSThere are a few things that don't work or that I find hard to believe. For example, people who dedicate their life to science discover aliens, and their immediate reaction is, ""They are my Gods.""Then they do this thing where maybe the aliens aren't so bad, until a huge reveal of, ""you are bugs."" The problem is, they already told us from the beginning that the aliens will be bad for us. The pacifist alien says not to contact them or Earth will be conquered. They should have either left the possibility of peaceful aliens open until ""you are bugs."" Or stop acting like it's not already known by the audience.Then their is a mission to steal the communications with the aliens. They say they can't storm the boat with special forces because it will be a bloodbath and the passengers might destroy the data. And they can't use a missile strike or they might destroy the data themselves.So they come up with a plan to use nanofibers to destroy the boat. Which is a total bloodbath. Which also may have destroyed the data itself. Which also gives the passengers enough time to destroy the data. The fact that this idiotic plan succeeds is pure dumb luck.The annoying subplots I mentioned are the cancer patient and the love triangle he's a part of. Luckily it ended up playing a part in the plot. But we definitely didn't need to spend that much time with him dealing with his mortality. Or deciding if he wants to profess his love to his unavailable ex. Or imagining himself in a paper boat smh."
1	Baby Reindeer is one of the TV shows that came out of nowhere on Netflix, and certainly has created a buzz among the viewers. It is based on Richard Gadd's real-life experiences, and I think it could not be braver to make something like this and talk about important topics. This series is quite harrowing and deals with loads of subjects such as social anxieties, abuse, addiction, ideologies, and stalking. Jessica Cunningham is spectacular, and she deserves to get an Emmy nomination. Her chemistry with Richard Gadd is great. An off-beat aspect is often the mix-up and balance between the comedy and drama, which at times doesn't work as well considering how heavy-handed the subject is. It is hard to understand whether to laugh or cry. I guess both.
1	"Not the best show out there, but there are thousands of viewers out there whom I'm sure disagree.In my personal opinion I like ""House M.D."" better. In House, they don't know whats wrong with all the patients. In ""Grey's Anatomy"" they almost always know exactly what to do and how to fix it. But again, it depends on your taste. ""Grey's Anatomy"" puts a unique drama twist on the personal and professional lives of five surgical interns. My sister had me watch a few episodes and I thought ""Man this show is pretty good"".If your looking for a show with puzzles in which you must piece together along with the cast, I'd recommend ""House M.D."". If your looking for a drama that is more focused on the personal life of the characters, I'd say this title is for you, because ""Grey's Anatomy"" is sure to deliver."
2	I loved the 'Talented Mr Ripley' version, however, have enjoyed this just as much in a different way. I liked the fact that it didn't just try to copy the last version. I was a bit taken a back at the older Tom Ripley in this version but just decided that a longer time period had passed and got used to it.I thought the actor playing Tom was fabulous and also the different Marge was streets better than Gwyneth Paltrow whom I thought was the big weakness in the previous version.The black and white worked so well with this, more sinister, and moody version. Whilst the colour of the last version worked with the 'Talented' version which portrayed a much more extraverted and upbeat Dickie.The negative element for me this time was Dickie. There seemed to be nothing to like about him and he lacked any charisma at all. He was a bit wooden and sexless to be honest. Last time, you felt that Tom had fallen so in love with the Jude Law version that he could not bear to be rejected by him or live without him. This time, I just felt that Tom wanted to take over his lifestyle but had no feelings for him. So, I think this version has fewer layers to it and something was missing.Still, you just need to accept that this is a completely different version, and it is very watchable and intriguing. Certainly, the actor playing Tom IS the film. I think worth it just for his acting.
1	Amazing plot, quality dialogues, twists, acting, and best music ever for five seasons. Quality drop a little in 6th season, but still great season. 7th season not on pair with previous, but for me still a good season. Then came 8th season, a finale. The less I said the better. Ruined everything that was done before. Rushed, it was like watching on 8x. Dialogues were adopted for little kids to understand. 50% of storytelling which was important for 7 season, turn out to be irellevant, which made everything done before useless. Shame. It could be best series ever made.
2	When I first saw the promos for this show I thought ''not another ER copy!'' But from the first episode I was hooked. Sandra Oh's fabulous acting, Dempseys's face and great writing have done justice to ABC and the millions of viewers. Meredith Grey the star of the show may be slightly whiny not to mention that her ally mcbeal type voice overs always relate how she lost her mcdreamy to his adulterous wife but she seems reliable in a way that she is damaged and not perfect as many lead characters are. Shonda Rhimes has really managed to combine ER, SATC and Friends into one to create a show that is sure to be a future legend. However, the Shepherd marriage seems to have dragged on forever and really needs to end so as to please all the ''MerDer''fans. The love triangles seem to get more complex and exciting the more the show goes on leaving viewers on the edge of their sofas and wondering (and some wishing)as to what will happen next. Greys Anatomy has become my favourite TV show because it has really broken the ''medical'' genre barrier that is slightly ''done and dusted ''and explored other levels such as the pinnacle of a hospital, competition among colleagues and the love lives of doctors which are hard to roll into 43 minutes of viewing time. In lieu, Greys Anatomy is not just a typical medical drama but something more special, it is an entertaining show case which is captivating and funny. On the whole a ''dramedy''.
2	"I'd seen The Talented Mr. Ripley long, long ago, so remembered a few things which took place within, but it's such a truly beautifully shot, visually stunning and a cinematographically perfect that I didn't mind seeing any of it again.Quite frankly it feels like such a totally different take on the source material so as to be more of a reimagining than a remake.Each shot seems like it was either effortlessly framed by an absolute genius or painstakingly planned by same said genius with OCD.Seriously, every single frame looks like it could be part of a coffee-table book of a masterclass on composition, framing, cinematography, timing, lighting, contrast, casting, writing, casting, editing, acting and delivery.I find myself often shaking my head in disbelief at how beautiful it all is, and actually feel guilty when I look away to answer a text or look up an actor's name and resume, only to realize I'd seen many before yet they were truly transforrned. I've always enjoyed Dakota Fanning's work, but she's so utterly believable in the role that I forgot it was her for a few episodes. The rest of the cast is so perfectly placed and even the minor characters shine brightly.If memory serves correctly, the Netflix, teaser mentions something about ""Visionary Director Steven Zaillian"", usually an inflated, narcissistic ass-kissing of some festival darling-du-jour, but this man has absolutely earned the adjective and his resume shows undeniable proof over and over.I do so hope there is more of this limited series or at least another project from Mr. Zaillian soon."
0	And that´s that - the acting of Blackthorne is terrible, everytime he appears is horrible, it is cringeworthy. The japanese actors and actresses are great, the portuguese well...they could speak portuguese just like the japanese speak in their own language. I am watching just hoping Blackthorne dies soon.The setup, plot and storyline is quite good, but it is completely biassed so english appears to be good, and spanish and portuguese are the bad, when the real story is that piracy, dirty tricks etc have been always the trademark of the british. It is british propaganda on how good they are and how they rest of nations should be grateful that they are here.
0	So the series is finally over, and the last few episodes absolutely destroyed the legacy. The show averaged a 9.5 since season 1 until the end of season 8, now I just hope people remember to change their ratings to reflect the fact that this show is not deserving of a 10.It couldn't maintain a perfect storyline like Breaking Bad did, and I believe we owe it to future generations to not mislead them into thinking this is the best show on tv when it started great, but finished horribly
1	There is a lot of adaptation, and the main characters are set together. The narrative omits some background introduction and exploration of the three-body game, so it also loses a lot of comedic conflict. But compared to other boring science fiction works at the moment, a remake of a classic science fiction novel is still worth spending half a day to watch. In my opinion, the main problem with this adaptation is that the conflict set in the original story has its historical and political roots, and these deep contents seem to be unsuitable after substituting the subject and the place of occurrence, which is difficult for a reader who is loyal to the original book to accept.
0	This show had everything to be a great one, but putting someone speaking in english and calling it portuguese was the nail in the coffin for me.Portuguese is one of the most spoken languages in the world and they couldn't find someone that spoke the language?That's lazy and disrespectful to say the least.One of the main characters, Blackthorne, is also a terrible actor, he's a disgrace to the show, there are so many great actors that actually speak portuguese that could easily have done that role better than this awful guy.I'm disappointed with this and with the historical incorrectness too, Portugal never explored the Japanese, they were trading partners and friends, they should have read some books about it at least.Terrible!!!
1	The show was a surprise to me since I didn't hear nor read about it. The idea of the show, that it follows three rookies is also promising and should deliver content for a couple of seasons. However...By season 3 all rookies have become P2 which means the idea of the show has become obsolete.Almost no other cop has a speaking role and they're literal bystanders. In every scene the rookies behave like seasoned cops while the others just stand around and do nothing.In every case and murder scene and whatsoever, there's always the main cast coming as a backup. Like there's no other cop on town.There's shooting in every episode. And then they're all bad shooters. Hit rate is like 0.00000001% and then all of the sudden they hit with their very first shot.Nolan's love interest are getting more annoying with every season. In season 2 he starts to reconnect to his ex, a doctor in a hospital and every time the show goes into the hospital, she is there. Like there's no other doctor working there. But his girlfriend after her... she knocks the ball way out of the park. She is really everywhere and is annoying as hell. She is not only a firefighter but a Capoeira teacher, a dogsitter and even in the reserve. Like with his girls before, Bailey is everywhere and obviously the only firefighter around. The moment i saw her LEADING the military unit storming the premise though was the final straw.The amount of achievements the rookies manage to gain is ridiculous. By the end of season 2 they experienced and achieved so much, that they should all be promoted to Sergeants.Time is a concept the series doesn't take to serious. How fast they all get to the scene or can change their location... In season 4 Nolan and Tim met with an agent I think and she get's transported away by the CIA. 3 minutes later Nolan and Tim and a bunch of reinforcement set up a barricade to free the agent. And they're standing there expecting the CIA like in all calmness like they've been standing there for quite a while. How in the hell is that possible?Cases get solved way too fast and easily. The show would benefit from a main angle which goes through the whole season while solving cases in every episode. But further the main angle bit by bit.
0	The original story reveals the insignificance and ignorance of mankind. As the heroine of the first book, Ye Wenjie should be an independent and brave woman. Under the screenwriter's adaptation, she became a person who relied on having sex with men to obtain her own means. The adapted story does not reflect the reasons for her despair. Also, the flickering of the universe has completely divorced the original intention of the story. The new story omits much discussion of humans and science. Turning the whole story into a second-rate Netflix TV series.Original story was great and deep, now it's just a popcorn TV show. Really recommend those who like to think go buying a book and read it.
0	They have officially ruined GOT with season 8. If I were to recommend the show to someone which I doubt I will anymore, but if I did, I would tell them to stop watching at the end of season 7 and let there imagination take it from there. They have officially killed the story in season 8. This mistake is on the writers of the show NOT George R.R. Martin. The writers of the show one of which is the same guy who sewed Deadpools mouth shut in X-Men origins which should have been a warning to the fans.
1	"Baby Reindeer.Having watched the lot I found this show very self-indulgent, there was perhaps several elements of catharsis in this, perhaps that's why it was written, but despite this many of the psychological insights are shallow, perhaps this again was entirely intentional.As the show developed Donny just presented no internal resources and seemed unable to manage nearly every situation effectively, the exaggerating and ramping up of the drama creating a dramatic impetus. We come to learn why he lacked any resilience in episode 4The camerawork was excellent with some strange angles and viewpoints telling us all was ""weird"". It was quite a flaw in the plot to not have gone to the police sooner but as this is a true story we have to go with itCome episode 4 we had Donny's backstory, and quite a revelation it was! The drama throughout this section is a little disingenuous, the narration says no, no and more no, but before us on the screen we see complicit yes. I was confused when we, the viewer, could see what Darrien was about from the start and so must have Donny! When you go into the lion's den you will surely be eaten by the lion. Whilst we had an array of compelling explanations, mainly the promise of fame, from a personal perspective none of them quite rang true.In episode 5 Donny infers it's all the police's fault but it was clear that only 6 months down the line did he identify his stalker comprehensively to the police, what can you expect!Overall, it was okay, it was as I say very self-indulgent, the story was compelling but Donny fails to internalise the part he has played in his own life, the ending was overly contrived and the whole thing lacked emotional intelligence. The best scene was in episode 6 with Donny's mother and father.At best this is a 6 outta 10, meaning patchy moments of brilliance interspaced with dross."
1	Only reason for me is the lead I know Him mostly from CASTLE Otherwise it's been there done it.  The usual middle age jokes etc. U all have to pardon me I'm 71 so I've been around the block a bit 2 many times I will keep watching of course
2	"He doesn't have to speak like one!The Anjin's Long John Silver accent is really grating. Overemphasising every enunciation in a ""smokes 60 a day"" growl is wearing! I keep expecting every sentence to end ""har har young fellow me lad""!That aside, it's a gripping & intriguing! I am only half way through but the political manoeuvring alongside the delicate societal dances that the characters go through to not cause offence or give an indication of true feelings means you can't take your eyes off it.It is beautifully shot has enough ongoing action & twists to ensure each episode flies by.More of the Shogun & less of the pirate please! Arr Harr!"
0	Who in their right mind, would adapt 3 Body Problem into a hollywoodesque, Young Adult type series?Forced relationships, forced melodrama, shallow characters, anti-science dialogue(uh, it's fake, it's a scam), girlboss brain rot, aren't these characters supposed to be the smartest people on the planet?Making them all have a history together makes no sense, DB and Weiss can't write their own dialogue even if their lives depended on it.Science-Fiction without actual science, there is no interest in explaining anything that happens, the most you'll see of science here, are people making revolutionary math like 43 + 8 = 51 - 38 = 13, wow, irrefutable proof that the sun acts as an antena, even the mass appeal marvel movies tried coming up with explanations back in phase 1 and phase 2.Also Eiza Gonzales as a scientist WTF, i have my doubts that she's even an actress.
1	I would have given the show an 8 or 9 years ago, but the show has completely jumped the shark. Not only does the show seem to be spinning it's wheels with no clear direction anymore, but the introduction of Meredith's baby has destroyed the dynamic of the main character. There are now too many shows dedicated to the family aspect, and not medicine. This was a similar scenario to what happened on House MD. Sometimes, shows simply overstay their welcome on the air and try to come up with too many gimmicks and no new ideas, as Grey's clearly has. The new writers (in other words, the one who took over for Rimes), have ruined to show.
0	Work on your taxes. Clean house. Paint the room the tv is in. Better yet, paint a room other than the one your tv is in. This dull lackluster confabulation sucks the life out of a really great story by Patricia Highsmith. The B&W cinematography, while beautiful, is used like a series of photos in an album - static. And speaking of static, the acting... I'm a super fan of Andrew Scott. From his great subtly (Foyles War) to his great overacting (Sherlock Holmes) but even he couldn't find the way forward in the straight jacket he was jammed into by this screenplay and at the hands of this stilted director.I've now met the character limit required in order to post this and I'm done.
0	Season one and two were pretty good but now it seems like either someone on the cast is being held hostage or captive in some kind of critical situation. What the hell there's got to be more stories out there. I thought police stories were about different types of crime being solved.
1	The show was pretty interesting, with great characters and actually interesting plotlines. Though far from medically accurate, it was a good show. That is up until around season nine. Spoiler alert: everybody dies! Or leaves the show... or comes back later to visit another dead character in the afterlife... or gets traumatically injured.. or drowns for like an hour to then be magically revived and then go on and die again... you get the gist. Now, that said, I loved this show, I loved it until I realised how repetitive it was. It got boring for me. But by all means, watch it, it's great for a while. Just not for the whole run of the show. Should've stopped at season 7 or so, all I'm saying.
0	"What a waste!To be honest, I don't even really know where to start.How is it possible to make such a complete mistake when casting actors? No charisma, no depth, no nothing.Just a lot of blah blah without any substance.Spoiler alert:What I found worst, by far, was the role of this ""sick"" friend.On the one hand, this dude is an absolutely bad actor and in the best case an amateur that has no place in a NETFLIX production, on the other hand, all the scenes with this guy are far too long-winded and completely uninteresting for the further course of the story.If things do get interesting for 3 seconds, what follows is another endless amount of pointless sitting around and talking.The characters are so incredibly boring, arrogant, narcissistic, without any social skills. The dialogue is incredibly poorly written that it is difficult to seriously believe that this ""motley"" crew of mega smart Mary Sues and Beta Males have even known each other for more than 3 days, let alone for many years.The series had enormous potential, but this was in no way exploitedA few scenes were still pretty cool though, like the ""boat meets nanofibers"" scene was very or basically any scene in which Tatiana appears.By the way: The way ""intelligent"" people or scientists are portrayed here is almost childishly stupid.As if ""intelligent"" people are constantly quoting some great historical figure, constantly babbling about their own ""intellect"", or immediately emphasizing their leadership role in XY in the first 30 seconds of a conversation.Idiotic."
2	I've never played Fallout the game, I've heard of it but new nothing about its content.So I went into this series blind.Maybe for me that was the best way, as I can just enjoy it for what it is.Or maybe I'm missing little references from the game.But I can look those up and delve more into the lore.As for the TV show I can honestly say I'm impressed.The colours, feel and story were all top notch in tone.The acting from Walton Goggins meant he was perfectly cast as the Ghoul/Cooper and the duality of his character was brilliant.Ella Purnell was also superb in her role. No silly feminist politics just great action scenes and wide eyed wonder and bewilderment at what she was seeing and finding out.Give this show a try.Very entertaining.
1	To write my thoughts about this new Netflix series risks suffering the wrath of several friends who are huge fans of the original sci-fi novels. But alas, I love to share even if no one cares.I had such high hopes for this show and wanted to love it, but ultimately, I was pretty disappointed. I've not read the books, so can't attest to how faithful it is, but it felt like huge chunks were missing and I was forever trying to figure out WTH was going on. It's really uneven and not very engagingly written, and while the CGI is excellent and the cast ridiculously attractive (for physicists!), the pacing is slow and undetermined. The science was really interesting and I was constantly looking stuff up on Wikipedia, but by the end, I was more frustrated than anything else and will have to wait until the next season for more (perhaps).
0	"Reviewing a video game adaptation presents challenges. Because they are (except for Halo apparently) intended to honor the fandom and the original game. This series does that, to a degree.The set designs, CGI (except for the Gulp monsters), and production quality are all very good. And who doesn't enjoy a good old villain performance by Walton Goggins? He's great.Ella Purnell, despite the fact that she's saddled with a Mary Sue role, is also very good, projecting just enough ""fish out of water"" humor and surviving by the skin of her teeth as central character Lucy. Her standard response says it all, ""Okey Dokey"".Unfortunately, aside from those two there are many miscast ineffective performers, led by Aaron Moten as Maximus the renegade ""knight"" and Moises Arias as Norman, Lucy's brother. There are several small bit parts that are well done, but they are few and far between.The writing? All over the place. A lot of the overarching story does come from the game, but there are enough bizarre and gratuitous plot lines that by the end of the sixth episode it all begins to fall apart. The tonal shifts between overheated melodrama (the fifties flashbacks) to the hokey spoof of life in the vaults, to the Uber violent present day quests through the badlands on the surface do not serve the viewer well.Because they handle their roles well, the episodes that feature Lucy (Purnell) and The Ghoul (Goggins) can be fun to watch, until gratuitous weird crap starts happening. But Maximus' story is harder to watch until he joins up with Lucy, because Moten is so bad that it takes the viewer out of the story every time. His story is also so close to John Boyega's (as a defecting Storm Trooper in The Force Awakens) that his performance suffers in the comparison. He takes himself so seriously, and his expression changes so seldom, that it doesn't mesh with anything going on around him.Then there are the frequent plot problems (the all powerful knight suit can be deactivated by anyone who unscrews the battery/fusion core from the back of the suit. Really? Wouldn't the armor have some safety features to protect the knights from that?) that are the result of unimaginative writers. One of the biggest oddball issues is that all of the squires who are being trained to serve the knights as schleppers/pack animals are all skinny unhealthy looking toothpicks. Dumb.When you finish watching a series, especially one that ends with an open ended story line, you should be anxiously awaiting the next installment.Nope, not here."
0	There is no value in portraying senseless gratuitous gory scenes of people suffering. It does not serve anyone, does not improve anyone's life, it just creates distress in anyone seeing it. We are empathetic beings and it is not normal to enjoy the suffering of others, in fact it can cause great distress in many people. I did not watch game of thrones for that very reason. Nor Braveheart. I stopped watching the walking dead when it went too far. I don't care how wonderful people may think the story is in this, so long as they decide it's appropriate to include stuff that I would not show to any child, then the show is surplus to requirements. Producers of these kinds of shows need to develop a sense of decency.
1	I'm a latecomer to this program and only recently started watching it, so i'm reviewing at about 6 seasons in. Overall its a pretty easy going watch, there's good overarching character development and the individual episode medical plots are good and interesting. Engaging in the stories of each of the cast members is what makes this show watchable and makes up for its biggest flaw...the title character: Meredith Grey.Okay, the pseudo-philosophical intros into every episode are incredibly corny and irritating (probably not so bad if you're not watching a few at a time). But the main character, I can only assume was a massive mis-casting error they realised too late in the day, and just had to roll with it. The character is supposed to be 'dark and twisty', which we can all be forgiven for not realising because the actor plays her as complex as a plank of wood. But don't worry, the other characters make sure to remind us of this in pretty much every episode! She is supposed to be somehow pathologically troubled, but just comes across as an obnoxious brat who is just 'me me me' all the while making just idiotic, selfish decisions. She doesn't need to be likeable, just believable! Apparently she's supposed to be a brilliant surgeon, but that never comes across either. I spend the whole time thinking if she was cast differently this show would be 10 times betterSorry for the rant but she ruins the show in my opinion. The rest of the cast are brilliant, Sandra Oh in particular (effortlessly portrays much of what the main character should have), and everyone else are totally believable and draw you in. Still hoping she will grow on me...Despite the main character, she is not always the main focus, so much of the program is really enjoyable. And it is worth watching if you need an new comfort binge. Would have given 8 stars if the main character was actually convincing.
1	"Really entertaining, but sometimes it pushes way to hard on the 'police is bad' issue. Some of that is fine, but if a police series which shows mostly amazing und unbiased officers then pushes for those officers to ""push for change"" and somehow feel ashamed for beeing police... and then ofcourse you have characters like FBI trainee Simone in the later 4. Season. Absolutly annoying, doesnt follow orders given and does not present in a manner appropriate for an FBI Trainee, but gets empowered to heaven and gets an artificially boosted part in solving the case. All that as the struggeling black woman who wants to become an FBI Agent to 'make a change'........."
0	When The Rookie was announced, I was very excited. I have loved Nathan Fillion's work for more than a decade, and always give his new shows a chance. Unfortunately, even Nathan Fillion cannot save this show from what it is - an irresponsible, idealistic portrayal of the LAPD that entirely ignores the issue of police misconduct.In the interest of full disclosure, I should mention that I have spent the last three years studying law, with an emphasis on law enforcement practices. I have worked or volunteered for civil rights groups in Los Angeles, including ones that regularly sue LA law enforcement agencies.From my perspective, there are two themes that are repeatedly emphasized during The Rookie. First, police officers have a demanding job. Second, police officers rarely engage in misconduct.With respect to the first theme, it is without a doubt true that police officers have a difficult job. They regularly deal with dangerous criminals and put their lives on the line for their cities. Not only do they face dangerous situations on a daily basis, police officers have received a great deal of negative publicity over the past several years, meaning that their presence is rarely welcome in the communities they serve.With respect to the second theme, however, the complete lack of misconduct presented by the show is fantasy. At its most edgy, The Rookie presents its characters as having to make tough calls under tough circumstances, and in each case their choices are justified. This is in stark contrast to the well documented fact that LA law enforcement - including the LAPD and the LA Sheriff's Department - regularly and systematically engage in serious misconduct. Episode 11's portrayal as officers always being able to inform suspects of the basis for 'probable cause' or 'reasonable suspicion' is out of step with reality. Police officers in LA regularly engage in activity that violates the 4th Amendment, such as unreasonable stops and seizures.Even more troubling, the LAPD regularly engages in the use of excessive force, which sometimes results in the unnecessary deaths of innocent people. Sometimes, these unlawful killings are video recorded. For example, here is bodycam footage of LAPD officers escalating a situation with an unarmed homeless man, whom they did not have probable cause to suspect of a crime, before holding him down and shooting him six times. Ultimately, my disappointment with The Rookie is this. Despite the fact that it has a terrific cast and interesting characters, it utterly fails to deal with issues of police misconduct. Instead, it presents the police as nearly infallible officers of the law, who operate in a way that requires no reform. The show has the resources to tackle these issues in an insightful way, but the writers have instead sycophantically catered to an audience composed of officers who do not want to change.
1	This show started so good.Interesting plot with a older man finishing police academy and joining the force and his days as a rookie.There are some great characters here, Nolan itself, an ultimate good guy, Nyla , a bad ass detective, Bradford, tough but fair T. O. There are also some great and interesting episodes and some genuine humor (because the show sometimes doesn't take itself serously.But, after season one, everything went downhill - Bishop was out, Jackson was more annoying then usual, and some story arcs were just plain dumb - like Jackson and his new T. O. The show went from fun, to simply uninteresting.Not worth investing the time beyond season 2 in my opinion.
1	I'd give first 5 seasons a 9....but the latest ones a 5-6....so 7 was my overall score... that's my honest opinion.
1	"Grey's Anatomy... this show has probably been on everyone's ""to watch"" list at some point. While watching, I can honestly say it was a good show full of emotions, comedy, great characters, and even engaging plot twists and cliffhangers. But, the later seasons, mainly seasons 14 through 19, were hard to watch. I did enjoy it, but it wasn't the same excitement I had when I first started the show; I think once the OG cast left, everything felt off and more like characters were replacing the ones that left.Overall, it's a good show, but don't feel obligated to finish every season. I've watched what I needed to, the fan favourites, and I probably won't watch anything after season 19."
0	"Being a dedicated fan of the genre, my anticipation for the release of ""Shogun"" was palpable. However, my enthusiasm quickly waned as I invested countless hours into watching the series, only to find it falling far short of expectations. First and foremost, the plot proved to be convoluted and poorly executed. Instead of a cohesive narrative that drew me in, I found myself grappling with numerous subplots that seemed to lead nowhere. The pacing was erratic, with episodes dragging on aimlessly without any meaningful development, only to hastily rush through important moments later on. Adding to my disappointment, the characters lacked depth and failed to resonate with me. They felt like shallow caricatures, devoid of any meaningful growth throughout the series. It was a challenge to empathize or form any connection with them, which significantly hindered my ability to invest in their journeys. Furthermore, the acting failed to elevate the material. Dialogue delivery came across as forced and unnatural, making it difficult to immerse myself in the story. It was evident that the actors struggled to breathe life into poorly written lines, resulting in performances that fell flat and failed to engage the audience. Moreover, the production quality left much to be desired. From the mediocre special effects to the uninspired cinematography, it was apparent that corners were cut in the production process. Scenes that were meant to be climactic fell short due to lackluster visual effects, ultimately leaving me underwhelmed and disappointed. In summary, ""Shogun"" was a glaring missed opportunity. With a more coherent plot, well-developed characters, stronger performances, and higher production values, it had the potential to be something truly special. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver on almost every level, leaving me with a sense of regret and the feeling that I had wasted my time investing in the series."
2	"On this show: the city, all the interns characters, the views, the conflict, the funny stuff, the romances, the affairs and the drama are really Great My favorite is ""Izzie and George"" they act perfectly on those character. is there possible Izzie and George get into relationship likes a couple?...it would be very great and funny forsure...=). alex, finally he shown his character on sesion 2 it makes me more and more love on this show. Grey's anatomy is highly recommended, this show is really great keep it as natural and always gives the best best episode so far when George slept with Grey....it's really funny and dramatic..."
2	As a long time fan of the original Fallout 1 and 2 as well as New Vegas I was a bit hesitant to how this should would be written as the narrative of the Bethesda adaptations never lived up to the heritage of the original Interplay games or the Obsidian/Black Isle New Vegas game with their amazing narratives - which in my opinion Fallout 3 and 4 never reached..I was happily surprised as I avoided any trailers and hype before I saw the first episode. The intro music from Fallout had me smiling and there was enough fan service to keep me smiling.I saw the entire series with my wife, who did not play the original games but she did play New Vegas, although she wasn't a fan the same as me. She did however enjoy the series once we got a few episodes into it. Of course I gave her a live commentary to the lore of the fallout universe and I can't say for sure how someone who with no additional information about the background story would enjoy this series. But hopefully that extra depth will just add to the enjoyment and if you are curious there are a lot of videos on youtube to give you a summary of the previous 200 years.I know there was some controversy about how some lore was potentially ignored from New Vegas. I'm not sure it holds, but even if it does I feel like it doesn't take much away from the enjoyment of this series for me.It still has the dark humor, the gore, the cynical world where there really aren't any good guys. And that is what makes this world so special. I think this was a really good adaption. The female lead is not the boring strong female character that has no faults and therefore no character arc. She develops in every episode. And so do the other characters. You get more backstory and by the end I was very excited for more.I think there was a good balance here to introduce the major traits of this world for new fans as well as old and now I care enough that I am also worried, because I haven't cared for a series since season 5 of game of throne ended.I hope they keep honoring the lore and spirit in which the Fallout universe was created. This is a great show in a time where such are few and far between. And unlike most things produced by Hollywood lately there was very little Message and preaching. The story delivered and that is what should always matter most. I hope more studios learn from this.
0	"I lasted thro 2 1/2 episoed before turning this jibberish off. I'm ok with sci-fi stuff and other-worldy mumbo-jumbo, but when the plot requires super smart people to do super stupid things like allowing themself to get dragged into a video game, but they are playing because ""it seems fun and interesting"" without understanding how harmful it can be to them or what it does or where it comes from or how it works but taking huge risks with ther head is ok to them and a no-brainer, and all of this in order for the show to play out at all, that i have a problem with. Oh, and by the way, all the super smart poeple are young and sexy, well except one perhaps, and it becomes obvious who this is targeted to. Acting is half-baked, while the whole premise is on shaky legs. It's wonderfully intertwined and all, but when a show that wants to be super clever is based on a not so clever premise, as i said at the begining, then i'm done."
0	"Science is broken.That was as far as I got.I was already put off by the credits being a straight rip off of Westworld but using strings instead of piano.But two ""physicists"" saying something as dumb science is broken in the first 5 minutes, then one of them committing suicide in what appeared to be a giant tank where the only safety precaution was a handrail that you could just unhook and open, and from that point I could not care less about how stupid the rest of this might get. I watched another half hour to see if it got any better, and all that happened was some prettier people turned up and said similarly stupid things."
2	Decades after a bitter young Chinese researcher hits the 'call button' on a massive interstellar transmitter, inexplicable data appears in our most sophisticated research facilities that implies that our understanding of physics is fatally-flawed, virtual-reality devices that are far beyond our technical abilities appear, and brilliant young scientists start killing themselves. I found the inaugural eight episodes of the series to be compelling viewing, with competent cast playing interesting (if not overly complex) characters, excellent special effects, and an intriguing story-line (note: I have yet to read the book(s) or watched the Chinese version of the story). The only real problem I have is with the near omniscience and omnipotence of the existential threat that is driving the plot - hopefully the writers won't 'paint themselves into a corner' and end up with a story full of 'but why...?' moments. I am definitely looking forward to season two.
1	"While ""Fallout"" had the potential to be an engaging series with its rich post-apocalyptic setting and intriguing plot, it is significantly marred by its over-reliance on graphic violence. The show's frequent and graphic depictions of violence often feel gratuitous, overshadowing the storyline and character development.The gore in ""Fallout"" is not just present; it is pervasive and at times extreme, making it difficult to watch for those who are sensitive to such content. This overemphasis on brutality can alienate viewers who might appreciate the narrative or the world-building aspects of the series. It's disappointing that the creators decided to lean so heavily into these elements, as the show could have been captivating without such intense and graphic scenes."
2	This has been on my favorite to watch list for a long time but it's starting to get silly now. Season 4 episode 22 is just ridiculous. John Nolan almost single handedly defeats 6 armed men who for some reason put down their guns to after him mano a mano. Wtf? This is just stupid.
1	"There's an awful lot to like here, both for hardcore fans of the games, and new or casual viewers.The visuals are absolutely spot on, with sets, costumes, props and many many Easter eggs all being taken directly from the games, right from the start where S. P. E. C. I. A. L. And skills are directly and cleverly referenced. The colour palette is more varied and the lighting is brighter, but this is a plus point: had it been shot in grimy, muted tones, it would have been jarring and anti-immersive.With a score either taken from, or influenced by, the games, there's nothing to complain about there either.The alternative-history of 2077 is equally well realised and convincing, although since it's filmed with the same palette as 2296, the flashback transitions aren't instantly obvious.Commendably, the showrunners don't shy away from the gore and gibs of the games, with some scenes verging on body horror. These are counterpoised with comic relief, and character drama, again consistent with the source. Most of the writing and dialog is solid, with some standout scenes: it takes a brave writer and director to have two main characters talk over each other with competing narratives, but it works here. There are a lot of characters and plotlines to juggle and interweave, but credit to the writers, they knit them together in the finale.The core cast is strong, with Ella Purnell in particular being wonderfully winning and convincing as the innocent-abroad Vault Dweller.However, there are significant flaws which have to be addressed.Finn - I mean, Maximus - is played competently by Aaron Moten, but he's far too old for the role. Ella Purnell is also 5 or 6 years beyond her part, but plays the ingénue more credibly, helped by those startling eyes.The treatment of Ghouls is wildly inconsistent. The writers can't make up their minds from one episode, or even one scene, to the next, whether they're near-indestructible superhumans or not. And this does matter because it would matter in-game.Sadly, the overarching plot for the season is a mystery box reveal which - as an original idea of CURRENT_YEAR Hollywood scriptwriters, aimed squarely at their own peers and the Modern Audience that they are convinced exists - is as infuriatingly farcical and ideologically driven as you'd imagine. It retcons an entirely new Fallout lore driven purely by virtue signalling from the most hypocritically enthusiastic beneficiaries of the very thing that the writers profess to eschew.Tragically, the final few scenes are simply an extended ""To be continued... question mark!"" montage. There's no conclusion here, just a tease that might be fulfilled in 3 or 4 years. Given the hectoring that was just delivered, and the lack of any firm premise about what future seasons might entail beyond more retconning flashbacks, this is a weak and insipid way to conclude what was shaping up to be a solid season. The writers simply ran out of ideas and punted the ball."
0	"What is wrong with people that make TV shows? With the whole Country Divided in half they still insist on bringing politics into shows. Wouldn't it make more sense from a business standpoint to just leave the political garbage out? I love Nathan but I'm done watching this show it could of been great but the writers are sooo ""woke"" delusional that it just gets worse and worse. I watch TV to relax not to get my political information! Hollywood needs to wake up and realize normal hard working Americans are just not going to watch your heavily biased shows anymore. This could have been easily rated a 6 or 7 stars! The cast is pretty good the stories are fun and Nathan does an amazing job but it's Heavily, and I mean HEAVILY pushes down your throat every 10 seconds Far Left tones and Ideology! I think everyone should have their own opinion when it comes to politics but leave them out of TV shows and movies!!!"
0	"-Update- After watching the last episode, in which the screenwriter tramples on Clavell's original novel and its characters, I lowered my review one more star and propose a suggestion: Call the series ""A boring story about samurai."" Remove ""Shogun"" title because this is not Shogun. What a superb blunder yo made!I subscribed to this site after seeing that this adaptation of James Clavell's great novel has a score of 9 out of 10. In honor of this beloved author and his novel, which I enjoyed so much in my adolescence, I feel compelled to write this review and denounce the appalling screenplay and the complete neglect of the best moments of the story, entirely absent or distorted in this adaptation. The screenwriter took the main protagonist, a magnificent, astute, and brave character, and turned him into an insecure, cowardly, and somewhat stuttering stowaway. He took a politically astute genius with a noble heart like Toranaga and turned him into a spoiled child capable of striking a woman. In the process, he rejuvenated all the characters, who in the original story are at least twenty years older (I thought we had already overcome that disgrace of millennial productions, where we couldn't see old actors). The beautiful friendship that emerges between Toranaga and Blackthorne disappears. The intense love that develops between Blackthorne and Mariko vanishes. Mariko's best qualities fade away as they portray her as a warrior, slightly attracted to another woman? Of course! Because otherwise, it can't be a story of this era. What a sad era! To those who believe this adaptation is good, I suggest first and foremost reading the books or, alternatively, watching the 1980 adaptation starring Richard Chamberlain. Although there were cuts in that adaptation, as in any adaptation of a written work, at least the spirit of each character and the most important moments of the story were respected. In conclusion, a true missed opportunity, because this story deserved an update, an improvement in visual aesthetics (because the 1980 version looks very dated today). Perhaps a new version, in a few years, can accomplish what this one could not."
1	I like this kind of miovies and series. So I was very pleased these episodes scored very high on IMDb. So I had to watch it.For me, after watching the first three episodes, this is a no go. It looks very much like The Last samurai, although the Samurais are replaced by Shoguns. There is a white fellow who gets captured and learns the way of the Shogun. Similar story, stretched out over many episodes, does not have the heart and soul of The last samurai. But still manages to get a higher score. That's strange.So Hiroyuki Sanada has played in both as well; Shogun and The last samurai. But in Shogun he is the leader of his tribe and his part is played by someone else. Tom Cruis has been replaced by an other white guy and that's it.What disturbed me the most is that there is a lot of talking going on. During the talking, a younger man gets emotional and shares his anger in front of everyone. By doing so, he says that his bloodline will end. And so it happens that his ashes and the ashes of his baby ends up in two doggy bags for his wife. That did not make any sense. Cutting his thumb off would have been enough.
0	Fallout is set in a clumsily put-together post-nuclear apocalypse world based on the computer game of the same name.While it boasts some impressive sets, the convoluted plot brings out mediocre at best from the actors who merely go through the motions of the drab storyline that is as bleak as the apocalyptic world itself.It appears that creating a TV series based on a popular computer game has become a common trend, similar to how computer games used to be developed from TV shows or movies. Honestly, they needn't have bothered; watching your kids playing the game over their shoulders is more entertaining. Unless you're a die-hard fan of the game, this is one to miss.
0	"I see a lot of good reviews giving it 8/10, but I do not see much reason for praise. The show definitely has some interesting ""vibe"" to it, that people can like, for sure, and the style overall is not bad. But what about the story? Or maybe not so much the story, which is somewhat classical for a ""noir detective"" genre, but the narrative. It feels... Disjointed? There are these weird cuts here and there, including flashbacks, and Sugar himself often seems to be doing things that feel out of place and strange. Maybe there is some plot that will explain everything in next several episode (or even during the last episode of the show), but I just do not feel it. And I was just plain bored watching the 1st episode. But probably just me."
2	Baby reindeer was a good enough short series. It certainly held my attention and was never boring. But was often extremely maddening. The acting was excellent, however I had a problem with the two main characters. I found them both extremely unlikable. So as much as I found the show interesting, I had little sympathy or empathy for either.The show is evidently a true story, but hard to believe it happened exactly as filmed. Was Gadd as pathetic a comedian as shown? Was he as unbelievably stupid as shown? He never seemed to act in his own best interests, and allowed Martha to ruin what appeared to be a very promising relationship.Gadd did turn his life around in the end and prove to have some credibility and backbone.
1	"Lol, I started watching this after checking all the reviews here and watching the ""making of"" trailer and, take this with a grain of salt because I haven't finished the first episode yet, but I think I already pointed out what the problem is, that got this series so many ""negative"" reviews talking about the exact same thing: it all stems from the ""bad"" move of having the real guy portray himself, with all his current age's glory of eye wrinkles and ""no longer spotless"" skin (which rest assured is something we share, so no offense, there...) when the events of the plot is all stuff that supposedly happened when he was much younger, wrinkle-less and spotless, and thus with a much more obvious ""naive-looking-resh bud- like"" appearance. From a visual standpoint, viewers unconsciously associate even the slightest presence of wrinkles with older age, and with life wisdom and experience... meaning that, from the get go, they won't expect an ""older looking"" person to act out the kind of naive mistakes the protagonist keeps committing when first talking to the ""stalker lady"", at the bar, in the very first episode (haven't seen the part with the male-to-male thing yet, so I'm obviously not making a reference to any of that, with this opinion...).Moreover, when in the ""making of"" the author, who portrays the protagonist, talks about the the bar where he used to work, with his randy coworkers, as an ""heteronormative"" place, it suddenly struck me that he is probably quoting his younger self: using the same words he used to describe it when he was closer to that age, meaning much younger... However, if you don't clarify it for the viewers that it's your ""younger self"" that you're quoting, there, then a ""mature-looking"" face like the one you have now will only encourage the audience to judge you; because they'd expect someone of ""your age"" to already know that, nowadays, most people wouldn't say those former coworkers of yours were throwing disgusting perv comments at you and your ""stalker lady"" because they were ""straight"" (or, ... ""heteronormative""...), BUT, merely because they were just garden-variety pervs, and pervs can come in all kinds of sexual orientation (as people would assume an ""older looking"" person to already know).All in all, what this series needed was a comical disclaimer (""this is me interpreting my much younger self, so please do as if you don't see my wrinkles"") or a much younger-looking authir portraying the main character."
2	An epic series, most of the actors mastered their characters despite the bad season, that it is still the best TV show in history
1	Might be the most overrated show of all time. A glorified soap opera. I have only got to episode 9 and hope of something, anything besides endless dialogue, for something to happen. I have only given it a 5, because it is shot well. Beautiful scenery. Besides that, waist of time. And the mane guy isn't the best. His acting is as one dimensional as it gets. I truly don't understand the hype. Maybe is there was, I hate to say it, but a little bit of action? I love Japanese history and samurai's, but you never see them actually be samurai. Just walking around wearing swords, teasing is lol. Let them blades go!
1	"I'm only on Episode 2, so I can't yet assign a rating. But so far I'm disappointed.It's a jumble of clichés that together spell ""Hollywood,"" and that's not a compliment.Various actors and actresses are absurdly good-looking. One of them, the Auggie character, plainly isn't a physics genius; people who are tend to radiate intelligence, whereas she radiates a combination of vapidness and eye candy.Every tenth word is an f-bomb. Tiresome and indicative of bad writing. Real people don't talk that way, unless their IQs are well below what's intended here.Everyone (figuratively speaking) is smoking. I feel bad for Eiza González being forced to smoke, possibly for product placement revenue purposes? She won't keep her looks very long if she has to smoke in future roles.The acting mostly is subpart and the dialogue is vapid.I'll keep watching, however, as long as there's enough suspense."
0	The cinematography is fantastic. And that's exactly where it ends.The writing is atrocious. Not a single line of good dialog. The action is trodding, bordering on non-existent. The acting is terrible (except for a briefly shown Italian postal worker). And unfortunately the direction doesn't make up for any of it. What a sad waste of a good concept and a good cinematographer's work.In the prior two movies, the Dickie character was vibrant and the Ripley character was curiously deceptive, but never-the-less likeable. The characters is this version fall completely flat. I found myself caring nothing about what they did next or what became of them. The butchering script and direction left me feeling as if someone had taken an oar to my head.And so I have bailed, never to return. What a shame. My wife and I had been looking forward to this.
2	It takes a while to watch every episode, I first started watching and stopped at season 5, then I started again and really enjoyed it. A lot of people really hated the last season, yes the ending was bad, but I still enjoyed it the battle of winter fell was one of my favourites, if you couldn't see what was going on you're just blind lmao, the other battles are also amazing. 9/10 would be a 10 but the ending was pretty bad but it definitely doesn't make the whole show bad just most of the last season.
0	"This show started well. It was about a rookie. By season 3 there was no more rookie. By season 4 the show deteriorated into cliche childish shtick hung on implausible, unrealistic & ridiculous plots. - It's soul sucking.If it weren't for Nathan Fillion, we'd have bailed long ago. One can only hope that hist contract runs out or the show is cancelled. - We won't be watching season 5.Every episode includes a host of problematic dialogue and politics that scream ""clueless interpretation of reality"".This show reaches as far to the bottom of the barrel as possible. Low humor highlighting artificially inflated stereotypes delivering insipid lines and juvenile one-liners.The shame of it all is that, instead of taking the opportunity to FIX the social problems they believe they are addressing, they compound them by thinking ""getting even with"", ""getting back at"" or trashing the people they target is a solution. (HINT: Treating people the way you DON'T want to be treated isn't how you solve the problem. It doesn't stop people from treating you badly. It gives them an excuse to treat you worse. - You lose ALL moral high ground. End of).But this show has kid-logic & does nothing to correct it. Shame on them & anyone who buys into this broken mindset."
2	I loved Minghella's film. It's glorious Technicolor and beautiful actors... However, I also really enjoyed the Ripley series - surprisingly funny, slowly building anxiety and making the audience confused as to why they're rooting for a despicable murderer/crook. I thought this is one of Andrew Scott's finest performances - where he was Ripley instead of Andrew Scott playing Ripley. I loved that Dickie and Marge were almost background characters - and the scene with Dickie talking about his painting and Ripley's reaction to the terrible art works is brilliant, the same with Marge's 'book' - very funny. The murders worked well in black and white and the production design was superb by adding texture to our visuals. The only weak link for me - a miscasting - was the character Freddie. It is impossible to play a role that Seymour Hoffman was magnificent on. Moreover, Instead of focusing on what Freddie was saying I was irritated by their voice and mannerisms - really distracted. The casting should be seamless - we should believe they are that person...this series is not theatre, with the theatrical suspension of disbelief.
1	"The story is very catchy in the first two to three episodes. But in the later episodes the story roam arounds a very few people and becomes literally too much boring. It is even becoming unacceptable as apparently these 5 to 6 are the only ""heros"" who could save the earth 😂except the GoT characters, the other ""main"" characters acting seems boring and dragging the story unnecessarily. The series is unique in some terms, but the lazy screenplay sometimes makes it unwatchable.Giving the five stars just because of the exciting first three episodes. If you're beyond episode 3, then feel free to drop. Don't keep false hopes!"
1	This show was so great, but since a couple seasons, it decreased in quality. It's not the same show that I fall in love with. What happened to Karev that seems to be fading away? He was one of the most interesting out there, but now seems not having much to do. How can Grey, the main character, been divided for such uninteresting boyhood characters like Link and Deluca? I can't seem to like any of Grey's sisters, as well as Jo. They are all full of drama, but they don't make me believe or care. Still hoping the series to improve.
0	The story of the book is already GREAT enough, I don't see why it needs this much tasteless changes. And the portray of each characters, both acting and directing-wsie (especially Wenjie Ye, such a in-depth, complex and interesting character yet in here is just SHALLOW and PALE ) is SO BAD that I don't think they understand the core and complexity of this book. And all those political correctness is way too forced, after all, I think they just don't believe a true great story has universal attraction, despite the background or the origin of the story, so they put all those hollywood cliche adaptions in it expecting us to like it, SO WRONG!
2	Greys Anatomy used to be one of my favorite shows and I still care about a couple of characters remaining (Weber and Bailey)But the writing was off these last few years, with Karev having one of the worst exits I've ever seen for a legacy character.So, the first decade, EXCELLENT. Years 11-15, still good.But around fifteen the story felt off, some faves had left, and they added a character I absolutely despised. (Sorry, Link, you bother me.)I just tried to do a binge of season 19, hearing they were basically doing a reboot midstream. Sounded like a plan.Instead, I got the confusion of new kids ranging in age by decades.Story lines rapidly shifting by telling not showing.People out of character completely.I had to stop.It might work out. And I might return later with more patience.But Greys season one grabbed me with the mix of soapy romance and medical stories. Season nineteen's new people? Didn't interest me the same way.
2	Working to research the historical accuracy of this story however, it has been extraordinary so far. The emotion captured through the attention to detail keeps you locked-in. This atypical viewpoint on religion elicits convicting thoughts and is a sober orientation for audience to a time where law, sovereignty, and self-interest were approached in a more primal and, perhaps, barbaric manner. Furthermore, this story shines light on just how domesticated the Catholics in Japan were. Grasp of the language, hair and clothing, and peculiar cultural norms are clearly adopted and practiced by the colonial Christians.I will be supplementing this as I learn more-excited to see this unfold!
0	I'm 5 episodes in and I want to jump off a tall building. Slow, boring, and why on earth was it filmed in black and white? Trying too hard to be artistic when it's completely unnecessary. It only distracts from what is already a brilliant story.I wasn't holding out much hope for this. In a time when remakes have failed over and over, it wasn't surprising that this would be the same. Can we please leave the classics alone now?! The only redeeming feature is Andrew Scott who is generally fantastic in everything he does anyway so no shock there.Just watch the movie and save yourself some time...
0	"If you're a fan of the original series: DO NOT WATCH IT.DO NOT WATCH IT.DO NOT WATCH IT.Why simplying Ye's story and make up unnecessary drama out of her? Why slicing and combining plots almost randomly among the characters and rearranging them like a mixed salad? Why???As a big fan of the original series, I do admit that SOME of the characters lack a bit of depth BUT Cixin Liu did an amazing job in Ye's story.Her whole lifetime, not just the ups and downs, but also her own experiences with different people, both before and after she pushed the button, builds up the COMPLEXITY in her.In this version, all I can see is ""See how harsh that revolution was? That's why she decided to revenge!"" What???Really, you guys only have that amount of brain cells to process that level of characters and plots?"
0	The dynamic duo is back at it again, relentlessly ruining another great book with incredible stories. They have undoubtedly demonstrated that they possess nothing more than sheer luck, much like how they utterly decimated the last three seasons of the widely acclaimed Game of Thrones series. Disappointingly, they are once again treading down the same path of destruction. I must admit, I had harbored high hopes and expectations upon learning that this endeavor was backed by the esteemed HBO network. However, to my utter dismay, the production quality is appallingly low, the acting performances are cringe-worthy and devoid of any genuine emotion, and the overall atmosphere fails to captivate or immerse the viewer. It is a truly disheartening experience to witness such a promising project being marred by subpar execution, leaving one to question the reasoning behind entrusting such a cherished literary work to individuals who have consistently proven their inability to translate source material into a compelling visual representation.
0	As a fallout player who has played Fallout 1, 2, 3, New Vegas and Fallout 4, I was excited about this series.However, the first episode was one of the worst things I've had the displeasure of ever watching.There's a joke every two minutes and the tone is way too light. It doesn't take the fallout world seriously. I felt like I was watching a comedy show halfway through the episode.The actors and actresses are very annoying and the series overall just feels very unpolished.This should be enough for you not to waste your time on this series. I know I surely won't be watching any more episodes. Absolute garbage.
1	A lot of people will tell you that Game of Thrones is an epic high fantasy series, unmatched in production power and acting, as well as casting and writing. And this used to be true. GoT used to be one of the best shows the world had ever seen. Complex, interesting characters and plotlines in a rich, detailed world. It used to for around five seasons.This show has changed and while I didn't mind (even as season seven became downright ridiculous), I didn't mind for a reason.Game of Thrones had the chance to reveal something deep, something meaningful and humble about the world we live in, about power and about sacrifice. The way it was crafted was designed to climax in a finale that would hold a revelation inside. Something to take away.Now, as the last season airs, this possibility has faded. It's spectacle and it looks as good as a few hundred million dollars can look on-screen. But the story it tells is not longer important. It has become the antithesis of what it opposed. Generic high-action fantasy. I highly encourage everyone to watch the first few seasons of this show, they are some of the best television ever made, including some of the best performances of our time. And if you have seen them, you will want to see the last three seasons too. And at first, you will notice small things, but they don't matter that much. But these things eventually become big and blatant and the question the books may answer in the end? They don't matter.I have seen more complex Youtube videos theorizing about this show becasue, early on, you could do that. Little things meant a lot and details would become major themes. You can still do this now, but the fact of it is, that the writers don't put as many effort in the scripts as the people imagining the impossible. Most theories are based around the fact that this show used to be everything but generic. Everything could happen. Now, it has become generic. And things just... kinda happen. It hurts to rate something this way that used to be better than the most. But we have been spoiled with good TV in the last years and GoT doesn't compare to things like Breaking Bad anymore. Even though I wish it did.
0	"After watching Episode 10, I reduced the rating from 7 to 3. Why? Because the finale is just bad, so bad that it made me feel cheated. You have 9 episodes of build up, multiple scenes of large armies, all this talk about ""war war war"" and... nothing, not even a small flashback.When the finale began with a glimpse of an elderly anjin, I thought this would be a good flashback to the battle of Sekigahara. But it didn't capitalize. In fact, there was no reason to even bother with the elderly anjin.And what is the ultimately let down is that they didn't even follow the book. The show is called Shogun and they didn't bother to show you the ending in which he became shogun or show you what happened to Ishido. These were all in the book.Either they ran out of budget or for whatever reason, the finale seemed rushed and just overall one of the worst episodes ever and definitely one of the worse finales ever.-----------------With such high rating, you can be sure every review out there will tell you all the same positive things about this series that I can tell you. It is filmed crisp and beautifully with the newest technology and a very high budget production. The dialog is smart, deep, often with philosophy as well as wisdom. The actors are top notch and fit the realism and seriousness of the tone.But what many may have overlooked, especially the western audience, is just how ""comic book"" and cliche they portrayed ancient Japan. The one scene that completely throw me off the suspension of disbelief came early in episode 1 when a random NPC walked up to the prisoner aijin and asked a few questions. The ""leader"" of the village then just out of the blue decapitated him in front of the public.I get they're trying to portray an ancient Japan that was brutal, but that scene was so comical because of how out of touch it was with reality. For a better representation of how ancient Japan was, I recommend Yoji Yamada's famous samurai trilogy - The Twilight Samurai, The Devil's Claw, and Love & Honor. Even ""When the Last Sword was Drawn"" was more accurate and realistic in their presentation.The error in Shogun's portrayal comes from the fact the book was written by a westerner. It almost, I would say, demonized Japanese as if they were completely inhumane. This theme would progress into further episodes. Again, perhaps it is just how the westerners view the culture from their lenses.In Yoji Yamada's trilogy, it demonstrate that despite the culture, despite the code of the samurai, that they were still human, they still feared death and valued family, marriage, etc... In the movie ""Hari Kari - Death of a Samurai"" it showed how the most proud and arrogant samurai feared death and would hide themselves when their top knot was removed in order to wait for it to grow back than commit seppuku.For this, I would put Shogun at a 7/10. It is entertaining and it has a lot of great qualities. But for this one shortcoming, it just makes it really hard to take it seriously despite much of the element is actually based on a true story."
1	Starts good but then it falls apart.In first half of the season the supspense is growing but then it focuses more on the characters that are not so interesting to start with.In second part of the season, basically last 3 episodes, nothing makes any sense. And this is not for complexity but for the lack of any logic. The actions of the characters and the whole narrative becomes plain stupid in a manner that it is insulting inteligence.I was so annoyed that I stopped watching in the middle of the episode 7. Unfortunatelly, after a few days I continued watching.I have not seen a show with such contrast in quality in only 8 episodes, and I'm sorry I watched this.
1	"I really enjoyed the pilot ( 1st ) episode and gave it an 8. It became a downward spiral to a 5 at this point despite Hiroyuki Sanada trying to carry the series. He was amazing in The Last Samurai. Shogun failed completely to capture the nuances of Japanese culture that ""The Last Samurai"" perfecly did in a 2.5 hours movie. The writing has become terrible with useless subplots that don't really add up much other than as plot convenience/hole and shock factor.The cheesy long dialogues and quotes with the monotones are painful to hear. The worst element in Shogun is the language barrier where an unfit tryhard lead actor - Cosmos Jarvis - who needs a babysitter to make corny jokes between serious translations. If i was a Japanese, i would be insulted and ashamed as to how this series treats the Japanese language. Why would the series use cheap humor through a language barrier? How did this infantile, Cosmos Jarvis, even made through the audition? I'm dropping this series for good."
2	I was expecting a typical lame series loosely based on the game, but I was surprised. It's just a really good series, even if you haven't played the games. To be clear, you don't have to be an F fan to like this, but ask your F friends about some of the background info. But, if you have played them, you will be pleasantly surprised. There is a lot of accurate game candy in it. So many incidental bits from the games, the little details like the random foods. Even a totally accurate power armor rack. This is a story that isn't in any of the games, but that's not a problem, it fits the universe just fine. One small bit I found somewhat strange the 3 interconnected vaults. All the vaults were independent in the games, but it's not that big of a stretch, and it is needed for the particular plot. I think what the overwhelming positive response to this really means is that Bethesda totally blew it abandoning what is arguably the top video game series ever done. F76 was a disaster, Starfield a total mess. Maybe they will find their way again and come out with a new game that really fits the Fallout universe. Hint - don't try to throw in every concept you ever heard of, but with a lame storyline. Starfield if you can't figure that out. Looking forward to the next season. And yes, I binged all 8 episodes in 2 days. Not sure why AZ chose to release them all at once, but thanks. OTOH, I'm already in withdrawal. Now if they would just add Cait in power armor, life would be great.
0	"I'll keep this short and sweet. I enjoyed this at the start. But then it turned into a ""white man is bad"" platform. Add to this the stormtrooper skill level shootouts in every episode - officers shooting at bad guys with automatic weapons at a distance of ten feet and missing!!!! Officers shooting bad guys in the leg, arm or feet but never centre body mass. This show has become Naked Gun. Plus all the women officers are ninjas. I get that it's just a Tv show and it's not real life. But I laugh out loud at most episodes. Four or 5 officers head into Guatemala to rescue a colleague from the most powerful drug cartel and are home in time for tea. Utter nonsense."
2	"A masterpiece in acting, writing and storytelling about two people with personality disorders. Donny clearly has a Narcissistic PD and Martha has an Antisocial PD.I realised after that it was loosely based on the writer's life, I very much hope that he and ""Martha"" have received the professional help that they needed and are doing well now.I have to congratulate the writer of the review on here who expresses my thoughts so eloquently: ""Why are our human spirits being battered to pieces with a sledge-hammer by dramas like this"", they are totally relentless in their frequency and so highly prolific that it's so difficult to find anything that does not have this type of content. Of course I didn't have to watch it, it was my choice but I had to see it through due to my intertest in human behaviours and disorders.The two main actors who played Donny and Martha deserve Baftas. There was no weak link in this, everyone acted perfectly.However, as a senior mental health nurse working in a crisis team for 21 years I found it thoroughly depressing.I felt so much empathy for the main character, Donny, I felt so much empathy for the stalker, Martha too. When you're working with personalities both like Donny and Martha on a daily basis, and you've done everything in your power to help them but they continue to make life choices of self destruction, it's soul destroying.After wanting to change the world by being a nurse, I have learnt the long hard lesson that people can only be helped IF they want to help themselves, many do try very hard on a daily, hour by hour basis and succeed thankfully, but certainly not all.Donny started with Weed which generally always leads to darker paths and then stronger illicit substances, and I'm sure his mental health was impacted significantly by the heavy drug use and the after effects of that on the brain, as portrayed in the obsession with Martha after she was convicted, with the room covered in drawings of her and the obsession with the voice recordings etc.I'm absolutely sure that both Donny and Martha would have had many kind people come alongside them to try to help, and also interventions from mental health services etc.What really made me angry was when Donny went back to his abuser and didn't report him to the police, that just allows the abuser to continue and gives them license.The ending was equally as depressing as it was so true to life, negative and destructive behaviours just go on repeat.I actually wish I hadn't seen it, I'm off to watch Ricky Staniky again to cheer myself up!"
1	I'm leaving season 3 out of this review to focus on the good of the show. It's amazing. It's enjoyable, fairly realistic, and great casting. You root for the characters, you hate the characters, and then you grow to love those characters. Great story writing and storytelling, great execution, and in all honesty, it's almost a perfect show. Not a single bad episode. Except for season 3. It's.... pretty bad. It's not The Rookie in my eyes.
2	This series is thought-provoking and an engaging series that combines elements of sci-fi, suspense, and character driven storytelling.The show explores themes of morality, identity, and the implications of aliens contact. With its complex plotlines, diverse characters, and unexpected twists, the season offers a compelling viewing experience.While some episodes may have pacing issues, plot holes and moments of predictability, overall, the series try to deliver a satisfying mix of entertainment and depth. Whether you are a fan of sci-fi or somewhat dramas, 3 body problem looks like it have something to offer!
1	"The pacing of this series is so much better than the other version. The writers of this series have a better understanding of, ""get to the point"" than those from the other series. The nano wire scene with the ship in episode 5 was cool. I would say this version is way better than the other one. The other series was very difficult to sit through. The story dragged on and on and you had to sit through many episodes just to get a tiny bit of info. The game in this series was very short and to the point, but in the other series it was dragged out over many episodes.There are some absurd aspects to the story. Like why do these advanced aliens need earth? If they're so advanced why can't they just terraform a planet? Why do they accept a single individual as a representative of the entire planet?So far, I think this series is good. It is certainly more watchable than the previous version."
0	New season is to dark to see what's happening. Very disappointing
0	Sets ✅ Customes ✅ Acting ✅Plot: it was just the game...I assume. I have never played it.It felt exactly like you were playing the game. The overall final goal of the movie was very underplayed and just felt like it was the final quest of the game.I know what you are thinking, it is a game and the game has a storyline. Well if this follows the game's storyline, then it is not a very good game.I expected so much more from the show all while it followed the game plot. There is as just no substance to the show really.The sets, customes, and acting here great. And it ended in what I would assume, to be the ending of the game. Solve the final puzzle, and bam! Game over. Show over. Definitely sets up for a second season.
0	We have been waiting for the White Walkers,The Night King,The Great War,the Prince that was promised for the past 8 years and is that the ending that we deserve : Arya flying from nowhere like a rat and stabbing the Great Night King,who survived far worse foes for the past 8000 years?? What about Jon ? Why was he resurrected then if he was not meant to kill the Night King?
1	"It's ok. Not great, but watchable. Considering it came from the maker of the abomination Rings of Poop, I was expecting it would be horrid. And Amazon made the garbage Wheel of Time show too. Amazon has a history of ruining established IPs. But Fallout was passable. The story was typical for the setting; anyone familiar with Fallout would recognize the standard plot. The characters were acceptable. I thought Ella Purnell was decent in the lead role and she wasn't a total girl boss. At least they tried to explain her combat skills. Her performance was a little flat at times, but passable. Aaron Moten was decent. I liked his character's arc, but his performance was sometimes unconvincing. Like Purnell it was a little flat. I wonder if this was more about directing than acting. Walton Goggins was excellent as The Ghoul, definitely the best character in the show. I'm a fan of Michael Emerson and would have liked to have seen more of his character. More Dogmeat please! None of the characters made me want to stick a fork in my eye when they came on screen, which was refreshing for modern ""entertainment."" There was a little identity politics sprinkled in, but minimal compared to most movies/shows and it did not distract from the story. I probably would not have noticed it if not for the in your face saturation that happens in most shows these days. The ending was weak and really drawn out. Showing something slowly doesn't make it more meaningful. It was ok, but not great."
0	The last couple seasons have been so focused on politics rather than story that it's become unbearable. There are good actors still on the show but it's understandable why so many great ones have left. The last season they seem to be wanting to try and restart the feeling of the show with the interns, it has a chance but if they keep focusing on politics more than story it's a waste of good new actors. It's also sad that they take character like Hunt and make him into a whiny baby to fit political narrative they are trying to push. I really wish Hollywood/writers would stick to storytelling as most of us want to watch tv to unwind from all the craziness and politics plaguing our country.
2	Everything has been said about how bad season 7 and 8 turned out to be. And I don't see how I can write more than that already been discussed but this interview when breaking bad ended always lasted with me. So here is what I think went wrong for GOT summed up perfectly by a show runners who actually cares about his show.Vince Gilligan( Breaking Bad creator) on how he wrote the show : People think of writing as dialogue and but to me writing is structured, dialogue is cherry on top. The real story telling is how structural it all feels like by connecting every character. Sometimes you think of a great scene, oh we really have a head on turtle and then have it blow off whatever but if you have to square pegs into round holes in order to get to that scene then you are doing it wrong. We questioned everything, we thought of every possibility but then we bet it against is it legitimate as to the characters forward momentum. We wanted to know where Walt's head at and we applied to it every other character. We had gotten attached to some big plan or some big set piece scene that we thought had to be there but the characters dint wanted to do what we wanted to do. As a show runners your story line don't mean anything if you don't know where your characters head at. There's very little of what we wanted, it was mostly of what would he do next. It was always step by step what in this position knowing what we know about this guy what is his next move. Balance of the show is taking him far enough, but not too far too fast.
0	I only give this a 3 out of 10 because of one thing. I am SO sick of the politics outside of the show trumping the show itself. When Grey's first started, I ADORED it! I watched it every week. Then, this season, they moved it a different night, opposite CSI. I quit watching, figuring I'd buy the DVD. At this point, however, I really don't give a rat's behind if I ever watch it again. I'm really just sickened by how much rotten publicity an originally great show is getting - publicity that was generated by a stupid fight that cast members had and publicity caused them to fire one of the hugely main characters. There was no reason whatsoever for that fight to become as out in the open as it did. And now they're attacking Ellen Pompeo for something her boyfriend did years ago? Come on. Grow up and watch the show for the medical drama, not the lives of the actors and actresses on the show. I was a fan until all of this. I still think that the premise is wonderful. I still love McDreamy and Meredith together. However, when the plot began to be trumped by outside baloney, I gave up. I'm sure many others have too. Way to go gossip-mongers. Thanks for ruining one of the best shows on television.
1	If you request to some extra terrestrial civilization to 'come on over and help yourself,' and then are seemingly surprised when they do just that, who's to blame? When you create nano fiber and then use quite possibly the most contrived reason to use it against a ship, who's to blame? When a physicist seemingly can't count to five while his buddy is performing confirmation before his voyage, who's to blame?This story is apparently based upon a book but I have a feeling that the 'DB Duo' have deviated from the source material once again through judicial use of coke or, even worse, the book this was based upon wasn't worth adapting in the first place and they weren't smart enough to realize it.
2	The first few episodes might not be too fast paced but it does get really good once the story line kicks in. I do not waste my time writing reviews for avg. Shows but this is way beyond avg. And I really hope Netflix continues with more seasons. Would be extremely annoying of them to stop it on season 1. Haven't read the books so no idea how it all ends but I am super curious to find out!!I can totally recommend the show to sci-fi lovers and I recommend to ignore the negative reviews especially the ones stating it's not realistic.... It's a show about an alien invasion... so of course it's not gonna be realistic.... Definitely touches some interesting ideas and is pretty original which IMO gets harder and harder as time passes on considering the plethora of choices we have nowadays.
2	"Excellent series depicting the complexities of abuse and the psychological processes that can happen during, especially in grooming instances. I think it shows so well how trauma bonding can happen, which can make it so much harder for victims to share or report abuse because they feel ashamed and partly guilty. It also shows well how people don't always react in the stereotypical fight/flight response (attack/run away/report) but can often ""fawn"" (people please, unconscious fear that acting out will make abuser more abusive or self-destructive).The main character might have unlikeable qualities at times and yes he might (like most human beings) crave attention at times, but to say that's why he is abused shows how ill conceived so many people are about the psychological processes that happen to many victims of abuse. Most victims never report abuse or take ages to report it."
0	Had several great seasons to enjoy and great actors and characters but now it's so boring. The new cast has overtaken the show and are pitifully boring and unfunny. There are a few of the original or older cast but they are barely used and now are filler. It's a whole new show and only has the weakened structure of the original show. This new show is called force feeding the masses in how and what to think and what to say or not say or else your a bad guy, girl, it, they, them, bbq pit, or any other delusional word you want to be called. If I get a thumbs down you know who I offended and triggered. I used to get emotional and feel for the character and story they imagined and now it's lost the thing that made it great. The cast makes a difference and the current ones just aren't connecting. I really don't think this show can recover and it's about time to put down the lame horse and put it out of its misery. It's lost the magic and is now a ruined show.
1	"I know people love the show and I'm happy for them!I started my adventure with the series (Fallout 1 and 2) around the year 2000. The show, while going for the Bethesda esthetics, is quite close to the whimsical and satirical tone of the original games. I respect that.But it failed to involve me with its story. I like the characters, but the plot is a bit aimless, full of side quests and random characters (just like the games). So by capturing the games' vibes and esthetics very well, the show failed to capture my interest. I guess it's ironic that I was tired of it being so close to the games, but I'm looking for different stuff in games and shows. It winked too much, trying to say ""see, we get that!""...The casting is great and Walton Goggins is the highlight of the show. Lucy is lovely, but I couldn't care less about her story. Only her brother's plot got me interested, possibly because I like underdog characters and a bit of detective/mystery vibe (knowing the games I was aware where it was going, but still enjoyed it).So for me it was a fun time, but more like eating at a burger joint. Everything was fine, but it didn't blow my socks off.Still, I'm happy so many people love it :)"
2	This series really blows your mind. Starts out hitting hard and always surprises you. You fall in love with some characters, and loathe others. The depth of the story is very well thought out and it seems like there is a large purpose for what you are watching. Season 7 was short but amazing. It told a story of something that we all dreaded was coming, an ending. But low and behold, season 8 rushes in and destroys all hope for a well written finale to a story that has dedicated to staying true to the plot. So if you just now start watching this show, prepare yourself for a disappointing end. And even after people saying that we never should have expected a happy ending, that wasn't what we hoped for. I believe we hoped for an ending that would coincide with the rest of the story. Not something rushed and out of the blue.
1	Its beautiful and the set design and costumes are amazing.The Japanese actors do the best they can with the boring dialogue they are given.That's the only good things I can say about this. It does not deserve high ratings. Don't waste your time.Blackthorn is horribly cast - not the slightest bit believable as a tall Englishman nor physically different looking enough from the Portuguese to stand out to the Japanese as the reason why they let him live, unlike the novel. He is also a poor actor.And what is with the accent, or accents I should say as the actor cannot stick to one. Horrible. I could not believe he was a British actor. I'm English and I have never heard anyone sound like that including when acting in period pieces.
2	When the nominations roll again next year, I'd be willing to bet that the cinematographer wins. This is the most stunning looking production I've ever seen for a series like this. Just glorious! It is like looking wondering through a photography exhibit. I have a problem with the casting although I do think Andrew Scott is a fantastic actor. However, he and the co-stars are just too old for the characters if you are familiar at all with the original story. I love the cat!This is a very leisurely paced series and I know that many viewers will find it boring. I was fascinated by it and the episodes in which murders occur are highly suspenseful.
1	On the one hand we get someone who is so cunning and smart but then he and the other characters make stupid mistakes. Why would Dickie tell Tom he needs to leave when they're alone in the boat far from land? So, Dickie could be killed without Tom being seen as the murderer. And Tom moves a bloody body down the stairs with the head wound leaving blood all the way and is just lucky not to be seen? Why not wrap the head in a towel? And the police don't see Dickie's picture until the very end? How ridiculous is that?! I know it's critical that they don't but it stretches thin. I enjoyed seeing the Italian locales and hearing the language probably because I'm Italian and have visited Italy before.
2	"Is it the best TV show of all time? No, mainly because the denouement/final stages of the shows story arcs are too rushed.Compared to a show like Breaking Bad which has two phenomenal last seasons (with a few little bumps) Game of Thrones was ""Phoned-In"" by the producers/writers.For what it is worth, below is my overall rating of the TV show and a breakdown of each Season. As you can see in my opinion the show hits a crescendo with Season 4 and then unfortunately drops. In the latter seasons there are some incredible episodes and major spectacle but the show loses the run of itself due to rushed conclusion. The final season is almost a 101 of what not to do with a television series' final season Aggregates of my episode ratings by seasonTotal Series: 8.16Season 1: 8.9Season 2: 9.0Season 3: 9.1Season 4: 9.2Season 5: 8.8Season 6: 8.6Season 7: 7.7Season 8: 4.0"
0	The series is cool, but for the fact that they began to politicize the plot in the third season, there is a big minus.
0	This season makes everyone in Seattle look weak and feeble as if covid is so bad that everyone has a catastrophic reaction. It is incredibly unrealistic. As if a young 40 yr old heathy doctor would need a breathing tube for covid get real. Use to love this show now it just to ridiculously ridiculous.
1	The Netflix adaptation has style, I'll give them that, but it lacks a cohesive storyline.Its almost as if the makers of the series expects their audience to have seen the original or at least know the plot, so as to fill in the narrative gaps themselves.Most of the characters choices, makes no sense without additional context from the original film which is massive letdown.Johnny Flynn and Dakota Fanning were fantastic as Dickie and Marge. However I didn't quite like the direction the showrunners went with Ripely's character.In the adaptation, he's portrayed as emotionally sterile, and his actions are those of a psychopath. The original plot depicts a complex character driven by self-preservation.The both will make an excellent double feature.
0	Let's start with my end coments first. It's a lot of baloney! After all the hype we heard about this new show, it seemed to be just up my sleeve. Unfortunately, although the scenery is good and lots of fighting between different types of people, it is not clear initially what this show is about. Probably one has to be a gameplayer to know which characters are evil, good or indifferent. Even after viewing all 8 episodes, I still don't have that answer. I presume in the game the player decides who is good or bad. It reminded me a lot of Westworld, though it is very different and not Westworld. But the people behind this series also produced Westworld. I expected a better show . . .
2	Here the film craft is outstanding and the musical score is exceptional, really supportive.This is an effectively harrowing journey. About a high IQ psychopath and an average IQ victim. Most of the issues in this are caused by the irritatingly bad decisions made by the victim. At so many points he could have played his cards better and ended the troubles.We're presented with a bunch of faulty characters, much like some of us in the real world. We see so many films were the smart and sharp thinking protagonists blow us away with their intellectual prowess.Not here. The contrast between this film and the fore mentioned kinds of film is strong. Bumbling reactions to challenging situations make for an ever spinning tornado of turmoil in this series.I wish to feel sorry for the main character but can't because of his unbearable decision making. Perhaps this annoyance is amplified by the fact that real life can be tricky like this, and we relate the character to ourselves, when we also make poor decisions.
2	First, if you like a bit of intelligent sci-fi, this is for you. I nearly skipped 3 Body Problem because the write-up and reviews suggested it was going to be awful. I am very pleased that I eventually jumped into this. Yes, it is TV that is mostly rooted in some hard science. But it's a TV programme about super advanced aliens on their way to conquer Earth. So, and like all sci-fi, you are going to have to suspend your disbelief. I saw one review moaning that 3 Body Problem was not realistic because there was a 30-something woman who was a Professor of physics. I actually know a 30-something woman who is a Professor of physics.Second, the cast is superb. There are some old and new faces, and not one of them dials it in. It's an ensemble of talent. I would like to see more of Marlo Kelly, she looks like someone who can play an evil psycho really well. John Bradley and Adrian Edmondson rock, of course.The location filming takes the cast all round the world, the only minor gripe is the CGI. When it is there, the CGI is cumbersome. But the locations, costumes and sets are great. The time needed to get to know the characters is not there, so some of the more emotive scenes don't resonate as much as they could. But for an eight episode season, that's a minor gripe.The story is quite complicated, and you do need to pay attention. The early episodes can be a little confusing as they jump around a bit. But all is explained and eventually makes sense. The second half of the season is more-or-less linear. I haven't read the books, so don't at all care if they are faithful to them. I just want to be entertained, and 3 Body Problem does just that.
0	It is time to put this to rest. You need a score card to keep track of who is in bed with who. Having patients give love advice to the doctors is too much.
1	Fallout series is a cult game series. It's universe is build up upon 6 games. Has lot's of places, characters and stories. However, looks like dear producers and writers of Amazon Studios decided to only use 'the popularity' among these aspects. To make the show suitable for both long-time fans and newcomers, in their own views 'suitable', they mostly wrote it without a decent storytelling. Episodes 2, 4, 5 and 6 suffers from this very badly to be honest. They could have told this story in 4 episodes. Adding 4 more episodes only thin out the story's effectiveness. Other than these problems, it's a faithful adaption and a worthy continue for the Fallout universe. Only including episodes 1, 3, 7, 8.
0	Loved seasons 1 and 2. Better than expected US cop show. As others have noted, however, season 3 is terrible. They've decided that their audience is not there to be entertained but to lectured, treated with condescension and patronised. It's so bad!
0	My last review doesn't seem to have been posted. I suppose someone has to weed out some of the terrible reviews it's getting to keep that rating up? Stop with the social lectures! Stop ruining TV!
0	I mean do David and weiss have become dumber since Game of thrones.So many plotholes in this.First of all Santi is telepathic. But according to wade, they cannot see what the 'brain' is thinking. Lol. Dumb.And Auggie's nano fibre is can be used for dangerous means as we have seen, but she will upload it to make open source so all cana recieve this weapon.? Really? Brilliant idea?Dumb A. FTHE WHOLE EPISODE is based on dumb ideas.Why would the world leaders waste nuclear weapons and resources for a plan to send a 'brain', without knowing how Santi will react to it, that is gonna happen 400 years later. ?They would rather accelarate their research. There could have been better ideas.Looks like after Game of thrones, these writes have lost their brain.
1	1st main protagonist: male, griefing, whiteHis child: exceptionally bright and brave, mixed race for no reason except that's how it works today (compare e.g. The Last of Us)2nd main protagonist: jovial and resilient female, whiteFather figure: wise and kind, on his way out, whiteAll younger men: weak or intimated by life, whiteFirst villain: female, ethnically ambiguous3rd main protagonist: troubled past, has issues with anger, male, blackBest friend of 3rd protagonist: tough and sly, of ambiguous gender, LatinAlrighty, folks. This is really swell. Now that we've went through the mandatory checklist, let's get on with the story. To have as many random scenes as possible, we will split one narrative up into four, understood? We will make it fit later on in the editing room. Don't think of it as a conventional story, or four conventional stories for that matter. It's more like snapshots of that trademarked Fallout feeling.What's that? Speak up if you wanna say something, son! What?! No, Todd, it does not matter if the writing is full of plotholes so big they are actually safety hazards. Main thing to keep in mind is that we're dealing with a hypernervous *gamers* here anyway and they just can't cope with long introductions and thoughtful setups. We have to make as many cuts as possible and also introduce a couple of dozen more characters! Yes, Todd, I'm sure about it. After all, my 11-year-old does play Fortnite so I know a thing or two about the mind of a gamer.Meanwhile, the gamer: *proceeds to play a random Fallout title in which the main story alone is about 50 hours long and happily immerses themselves into the world and there's nothing they hate more than bad action, cheap graphics, stiff dialogue and getting rushed through the story while at the same time being held up with trivial fetch quests*EDIT: My, oh my. It actually gets worse. I already wondered where the Asian typecast was and then they have that tinkery, nerdy woman who likes science and stuff. Guess what ethnicity they chose for that character? It's a very different kind of racism we are in the process of developing and it baffles me that nobody is offended by it. Also, the writing gets worse and the camera is always moving around ever so slightly to mask that nothing is actually happening in the scene. The choreography of the action is amateurish, full of errors and overloaded with bad CGI. I do like the actors and they certainly do their best (esp. Ella Purnell and Aaron Moten, you can see they had fun delving into their characters) but overall, this is yet another series that is already massively overrated. Some other reviewers stated it succinctly: this is much more a Disney production than anything else.EDIT2: A lot of people out there relegate the bad reviews to gamer rage. Funnily enough, there aren't that many 1/10 reviews out there, and much more inflated 9s and 10s. And what's even more curious: if you go to the respective forums, you can easily see that Fallout fans actually love the adaption because it is truthful and full of hidden lore. But I am not only a Fallout fan but also a fan of great TV shows. And this one is simply not one of them.
2	As is the norm, not subscribing to cable (or even owning a TV for that matter) I got into this after it's inception. Not sure if I'd like it or not, decided to try with it due to the fact Nathan Fillion was in the lead role. I've been a fan of his acting since Firefly, and later on with Castle, which was a lot lighter, but entertaining none the less. With all that said, I'm streaming the first season of The Rookie, and loving it. So far, there are no unlikable actors/characters, and it's truly not what I expected (in a good way) suspenseful drama that can literally keep you on the edge of your seat. The two part episode midway through was hella intense. There is a bit of violence, but it totally fits in and not over the top. No sex/nudity, and for me the best part is no swearing, including taking the Lords name in vain, which for me could be a deal breaker. Great show, writing, directing, and cast!
1	Overall the show is a solid 9 except for the negative views on policing in general which runs through the show in order to mimic the far left ideology, which is anti-police overall.Solid acting, excellent suspense and great plot twists.
0	Two things. First. If the main characters is supposed to speak both English and Portuguese ... But speaks ONLY English ... What is the point of the story? Why is he not speaking Portuguese? Secondly, after traveling the oceans without any food or water for month, youbshould see his body. He must have kept all the food and water for himself, and he shouls be blamed for the poor health of his equipage.On top, everything is crystal clear, spotless and new. Because Japanese are know for their obsession of cleaningless. Cliché.This serie is grotesque. Flirting with some cheap Telenovelas ... Next.
0	I used to love this show. I grew up watching it. Their newer episodes concerning abortion showed me how truly corrupt the pro-choice movement was and catalyzed further research on my part. Those episodes were DISGUSTING. I used to believe abortion was okay in certain circumstances, but this was absolute insanity. This show, I understand, is basically a glorified prime time soap opera program, but it's now turned into PURE propaganda. It's alarming. It's overtly ENCOURAGING abortion. I what happened to making it safe, legal, and rare? I read somewhere that someone involved in this show is on the board for Planned Parenthood. This is absurd. I'm over it. And I'm pro-life after decades of thinking differently.
2	I have played all the games and was eagerly anticipating the release of the show. To be honest, I didn't expect it to be as good as it turned out to be. I was expecting a lighthearted approach with more comedy and less violence and gore. However, I was pleasantly shocked by the direction the show took, which was a perfect blend of action, violence, humor, and storytelling.The pacing of each episode was spot on, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout. I was hooked from the very first episode, and each subsequent episode left me wanting more. The story was captivating, and I loved how the show explored it from every perspective. I found myself empathizing with each faction, and I couldn't help but feel invested in their respective journeys. At the moment, I am firmly on team Coop, but I am open to switching sides in the upcoming season.However, the only minor issue I had with the show was something that most people could probably guess. I understand that many studios feel compelled to include certain elements for political reasons, and this show was no exception. While I acknowledge the importance of these issues, I felt that it detracted somewhat from the overall experience. Despite this, I still greatly enjoyed the show and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a thrilling, action-packed adventure with plenty of heart and soul.
0	Two seasons of a pretty good cop show then came the Season 3 slide down hill until rock bottom episode 7 when they jumped the the Shark. Absolute crap, especially when judged against the first two seasons. The writers, directors, actors, in fact everyone associated with this episode should hang their heads in shame. Do everyone a favour and pull the plug on this show NOW as there is no coming back from this crap. I would rate the show a solid 7 for the first two seasons. I gave it a 2 here based on season 3 episode 7 as nobody reads 1 star reviews, or 9 and 10 for that matter.
0	"I actually liked this series, at least for half season. But as the story continued, turned out Toranaga as a leader, was willing to sacrifice anyone (but himself) for his personal cause (to be a shogun). Most of his closest friends and family died, not by fighting the enemies but by being taken advantage of their loyalties. In fact Toranaga gave them a ""purpose"" to die, wrapped in a so called ""honour"". In the end he was the only one who won. I can only imagine how cold he was as a character, enjoying his victory and living rest of his life at ease with all his closest friends and family died on his watch. I had high hopes that Toranaga would turn out to be a honourable leader like Katsumoto in ""The Last Samurai"". So much for a Japanese ""honour"". I'm only glad I didn't read the book, saved my time by watching the series but regret that such an awful character won the story."
0	First i've not read the books and i wont read a fantasy book that fatter than my encyclopedia. Sure Sean Bean did hold my interest enough so i bothered to even look the source material and keep watching, but that was it. After they killed his character the show started missing enough charismatic actors to keep it interesting. You had Charles Dance, again killed in spectacularly idiotic fashion. And we are left with cast's outcasts, who do passable job if the plot is good, sadly it isn't. And that is this tv show's problem it's quality has been dropping and has finally tanked, simple as that. Now maybe that it got too hyped, it continued too long, but while i wasn't looking forward to seasons 2-3 at least they were interesting and kept me watching, this last season(8) and later season from 4 i feel like sitting back and watching Married with children would be more entertaining and edge of the seat exciting.
1	First time viewer, I find the OR scenes to be good drama but the cast of characters? My, oh, my. So many shallow people, (Bailey aside), in one drama series. George who fits more in as village idiot than any serious medical person you'd be happy to let loose with a scalpel. Meredith Grey would probably be sectioned in the real world though her mother played a brilliant role. The on-off relationship with Derek Shepherd is nauseating. I shall probably continue to watch for the terrific medical drama that it is and right now I'm in the 3rd series and hoping George makes an early exit. Paradoxically, Christina is probably sociopathic but will be a great surgeon and will probably chill with time
1	Knowing about the book, I was very excited to start this show alas the whole thing was underwhelming. The storylines that are interesting are the ones where they've tried to stay in-line with the book. The rest of the stories are very disjointed, the friend group?! Yikes. Some of the characters are so weak that it is hard to be interested in their stories.The flashbacks and the 'game' are some of the more compelling parts that pique interest alas as soon as the story reverts to current time it falls apart.Everything has been dumbed down and diluted with some bad writing and some average acting. A total shame that Netflix fumbled a potentially epic show.
1	This Prime adaptation of Bethesda's hugely successful game series does a surprisingly good job of both being a decent watch in it's own right, and of bringing the games to life.Fallout was a well-chosen title to adapt: it's enormously rich in story, creativity, humour and atmosphere throughout. It's utterly immersive and full of fabulous, convincing characters and places.The story begins in the claustrophobic confines of Vault 33, home to what's left of the human race in a post-apocalyptic world. And they're a surprisingly cheerful and phelgmatic bunch. Until circumstances oblige our heroine, Lucy, to leave the safe familiarity of the Vault and go exploring the unknown Wastelands above. And then all hell breaks loose.If you have played the games, the look, tone, sounds and details will take you right back there, and there's very little to complain about. Many of the scenes, costumes, and characters will be delightfully familiar.But is it great TV? Well, yes and no.I really enjoyed Fallout, and honestly I think there is much to like about it. And it's clear that some people who haven't played the game, and indeed might not normally be fans of this genre, enjoyed it too - see the review by the usually hard-to-please Lucy Mangan in The Gurdian, for example.However, personally I'm not convinced that it would be easy to 'get it' if you come to this cold.What do I mean by that? Well, solidly delivered emotional or action scenes will frequently be punctuated by moments of very cheesy humour that could feel awkward, but again are true to the source material. The cheesiness is also quite effective relief from the very graphic (if cartoon-like) violence and horror.Similarly, some of the sets and studio lighting really look like something straight out of 1970s TV (cardboard rocks and painted backdrops). But so what? It's a game adaptation - it's allowed to look slightly unreal, and even that production style feels deliberately chosen to add to the retro kitsch vibe.Meanwhile, many of the characters are just great - Walton Goggins' The Ghoul chief among them, with honourable mentions to Sarita Choudhary as Moldava and Michael Emerson as Wilzig (aka The Head).Elia Purnell does a fine and charming job of carrying the lead as Lucy MacLean, and it's great to see Kyle MacLachlan appearing as her father - again a welcome throwback to worthy forebearers of this show including Twin Peaks and Dune (you know, the other one). But yes, criticism of Aaron Moten's turn as Maximus is probably fair - his range of emotions seem broader when he's in the T60 suit than when he's out of it.Give it a go, you might like it. If you played the game, I reckon it's a 9/10. If not, it's still fun if you go with the flow. And if you don't like it, well it's not the end of the world...
1	Please send this once fabulous series to Dignitas inSwitzerland to be put out of its misery. It's the kind thing to do! No more!
1	"This show starts out amazing. Characters are great, acting is very good (if you leave out Meredith) and the plot is addictive. And then, it all goes bad. After season 8, this show is 100% NOT worth the watch. Talk about the ""Great Depression of Grey's anatomy"" - the story line suddenly sucks, the characters aren't the same, and the show never gets better.After Lexie and Sloan die, the 9th season (worst ever) is pretty boring. On top of that they put together April and Jackson for the most irritating and unbelievable couple ever.A classic example of a show that should have stopped 12 seasons earlier than it has."
1	"Grey's Anatomy– Don't Believe Everything It was seen that half of the patients receiving CPR made an adequate recovery. In reality, about 13 percent of patients actually survive in the long-term, explained senior author Susan Enguidanos, Associate Professor at the Davis School and an expert in end-of-life care. ""Many people have no understanding of genuine CPR survival, making medical care decisions for their family members and themselves based on erroneous assumptions"".About 42 percent of older adults claim that their knowledge about health and medicine comes from television. As a result, most of these individuals base healthcare preferences on inaccurate concepts, such as how to survive a heart attack.The study discovered many interesting aspects about CPR, basically discrepancies between what is shown on television and the reality. The research team viewed episodes of famous medical shows and found 46 different depictions of CPR – defibrillation or chest compressions. They recorded whether the patients in the shows lived or died after the technique, the cause of their cardiac arrest, their backgrounds and age."
2	I loved season 1 and 2, season 3 was a bit too political. I'm sure since most of this has passed over in Hollywood season 4 will be better.
2	The premise of Fallout is very disturbing and dark, but the writers did a magnificent job of balancing that with humor. In fact, I would say how they handled the dark with the light is the best part of this series.Fallout must be gory, edgy, profane, and disgusting. Some are put off by that, but that is the Fallout world. Those who have played the games know that well. The producers did a good job presenting that world. The contrast between vault dwellers and the above-grounders was well crafted.The characterizations, for the most part, were good. The costuming was excellent. The settings and attention to details was very good. This is one of those series where the cost of production can skyrocket within just a few seasons and likely cause it to be canceled. But I hope we can get several seasons before that happens.
1	Sometimes it seems all the big networks make are police/legal procedurals or medical dramas. Rookie really stood out, which is a challenge in that primetime environment.Following an older rookie was a smart idea. The patrol aspect is the best. It's chaotic, hectic, feels far less contrived. We get to see what feels like a more real portrayal of the lives of men and women in law enforcement. It's funny, it's poignant.In later seasons, this disappears quickly and the show becomes much like every other police procedural show. Performances remain pretty solid, but there's a bunch of silly extraneous drama added for everyone to have something to do. Little or nothing of patrol. Investigations. Serial killers obsessed with the featured officers. Less surprises, life lessons and tie ins you can see coming a mile away.Season 5 had a chance to return to the basics with Nolan becoming a trainer himself, but no dice unfortunately. Feels like a mountain of wasted opportunities. Watch season 1 and pretend it was cancelled after that.
0	Yet another play in which history is misrepresented, I would even say misled. Despite portraying the greatness of Japan, once again an Englishman plays a key role in the story. The Portuguese are once again portrayed in a position without any merit.Even the Spaniard is portrayed as a reckless and impulsive pilot, while the Englishman is the competent pilot who saves the boat.This is why the UK and the USA have culturally conquered the world, they have brainwashed people's historical memory.I don't have much more to add, I don't know why it has such a high score, the plot is nothing exceptional.Just another product driven by the powerful marketing of the film industry.
2	"This is an excellently made series with high production values but it is a shame that the enjoyment is reduced because we cant read the subtitles without either one of us standing next to the screen or liberal use of the pause button. Viewing is interrupted with regular calls of ""what did that say"", ""rewind, I couldnt read it"". Alright, I am the wrong side of 50 and our TV set is only 40 inches but, still, making the subtitles a size that can be read would be a great help. I have no idea how people manage to understand what is happening if they are viewing on a mobile device. It spoils the experience greatly."
0	"It is okay. I am watching it on Sling TV and the CONSTANT REPETITIVE Disney ads are such a distraction that they make the show almost un-watchable, though. I might have rated this show a 6, but it drops to 4 just because of those constant, repetitive, ads.The show itself? I thought the nudity was gratuitous and unnecessary.The more I watch this, the slower and worse it gets. Dull scenes filled with bloated lines and painfully slow action. Watching this is like watching paint dry.So many of the ""10"" reviews are similar in wording, and style. Anyone else starting to think that upwards of 50% of the reviews on imdb are fake? I know I am."
2	"Having completed Fallout 3, New Vegas, and Fallout 4, I initially expected to dislike this series, but I found myself binge-watching it through the night.The Fallout games are renowned for their post-apocalyptic and atompunk RPG elements, featuring a vast exploratory scale, eccentric factions, gratuitous violence, and offbeat humor.This series encapsulates all those aspects while managing to strike a balance by infusing a grounded dramatic tone that intertwines the excesses within a Western-style narrative structure, typical of modern series. It seamlessly integrates the main quest with character development, glimpses into the pre-nuclear world, and compelling sequences set within the Vault.Contrary to my initial concerns, the series avoids being overly absurd, showcasing well-thought-out design elements. The dialogue feels authentic, the storyline, albeit eccentric, aligns with the universe's essence, and the actors deliver performances that lend credibility to the narrative.Walton Goggins shines as Ghoul, Kyle MacLachlan impresses with his portrayal, and the entire cast delivers commendable performances. The chemistry between Lucy and Maximus is particularly noteworthy.It seems like Bethesda's Todd Howard has reason to celebrate, as this series is poised for success and may even boost sales of the original Fallout games. Following the success of ""The Last of Us,"" this adaptation further solidifies TV as a platform to expand upon vast gaming worlds.I am optimistic about the continuation of this trend and wholeheartedly recommend this series to fans of the genre and anyone who appreciates sci-fi and fantasy subgenres. ""Fallout"" the series earns a solid 8 out of 10 in my rating."
1	Season 8 episode 3 was a complete let down....why oh why destroy the story to appease fanboys
0	I heard this would focus on BLM but all the guy in the second episode did was piss me off. Blaming cops for trying to help his community and not getting his own community together to stop drug dealers and vandals from ruining it.The guy used a bike lock to close a playground because used it for either dealing or doing drugs. That's like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound.Getting tired of shows pushing political messages instead of just being entertaining
1	This show is absolutely stunning. It contains some of the most well fleshed out characters and plotlines ever written, containing gripping plot twists and unmatched character dialogue. However, this is not true for the entire series. Seasons 1-6 are incredibly written and acted, and remain the pinnacle of modern television. Season 7, while still great, is just that. Fabulous and entertaining, yet not golden. The final season and it's ending, however, have ruined the show, and will leave you feeling utterly disappointed and dismassed.While previous seasons have featured stunning plot points and made revolutionary contributions to modern storytelling, the final season and it's conclusion lacks any semblance of these previous seasons, ignoring seasons of character development, illogical plotlines, and absurd dialogue. The whole season feels so out of place and nonsensical that it tarnishes the legacy of Game of Thrones. After seventy-odd episodes of epic build-up, Game of Thrones is a frustrating let down with a poorly written conclusion. Plotlines built up over seven seasons vanish with no payoff, and characters you are so vested in suddenly lose their multi-faceted layers of development in a confusingly written mess. Because of this, I sadly recommend avoiding the series completely.
1	Good series, but nowhere as good as Castle. Too bad that they canned Stana
0	Or pick up on the fact that they were talking about messing around sexually with their cousins? It wasn't even thrown in as a joke, the context was meant to be taken serious. It's already 13 mins in and they've mentioned it twice now and I'm grossed out! Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet wrote this offensive garbage and thought this would be okay to put into show based upon video game franchise and think that kids weren't going to watch this. Heavily swinging towards they need to be locked inside of a prison cell or a padded room away from society. Disgraceful, and I hope to God neither of you have ever put your hands on a child. These two Los Angeles writers ought to be ashamed of themselves and to Amazon who approved it as safe for viewers.
0	"Having a TV show in 2024 that is suppose to be full of people speaking Portuguese but all of them speak English is atrocious.I laughed so hard when a character said: ""Do you speak Portuguese?"" as he talks in English, I'm sorry, I just couldn't take it seriously.No wonder that Americans thinks the world resolves around them watching a series like this.The network and producers should respect Portugal, the country full of brave people that discovered by sea almost the whole world and also, the portuguese language, a language spoke by many today and a beautiful one.Skip this, if they do this with the Portuguese langague, I expect Darth Vader to arrive in episode 3."
0	Twisted. Bloody. Violent. And dark. There is good left in our world, but this isn't it.First, this story line is nothing new. Spoiler alert: the evil in the world had finally outdone itself and destroyed itself. All that has survived are a few remnants of humanity... blah, blah, blah.Maybe you need to be a sold out fan of this game to look past how worn out this storyline is. Nope, this is not for me.Next, twisting up sex with murder in a way that tries to make light of the murder-even make fun of it-just perpetuates that kind of evil that destroyed this science fiction world to begin with.It's not believable.It's not funny.It's not original.What is it?It's a waste of time.
0	The first two seasons were pretty good, but season 3 is unwatchable. They transformed it into some nonsense about racism with the most unbelievable actor at the center of it all. They seem to have completely lost focus of what this show was about. Season 4 seems slightly better so far, but I don't feel that they will be able to recapture the magic that made the first two seasons so fun...I got 3 episodes in on season 3, read some reviews and saw that it wasn't going to change, so I skipped to season 4, and I'm not at all impressed. This isn't a cop show anymore. What the flip are they doing with it? I imagined this show following the progression of a group of rookies until they eventually got detective or whatever, but that's not what this show is at all. Season 4 has turned this into the most unbelievable cop show I have seen in awhile.Fillion is really the only reason I'm watching this show anymore.
0	The first seasons are very well made and exciting. But the more they start to deviate from the books, the worse it gets. The problem is not going off the original, that's fine. The problem is their writers can't manage it. There is a serious decline in interesting writing or plot. It's especially clear in the last season, which is nothing but an endless parade of unfinished story arcs, anti climaxes and battle scenes where you can't see a thing that's happening and completely illogical nonsensical desicions. (Like placing seige equipment at the front and only having them fire blindly once in one particularly badly done battle). It's very sloppy, it feels like the creators didn't have good enough help with writing and directing after the series started deviating from the source material. Don't watch the last season. I would give it 7/10 if it wasn't for the last season. Or just watch the six first seasons and pretend it ended there. You will just be hugely dissatisfied if you watch the last few seasons since nothing is properly concluded.
0	"I didn't have much hope for the show, considering Bethesda's track record of retcons. Having the show take place in California raised the stakes even further. Todd Howard claiming the show was going to be canon was practically a death sentence for classic Fallout's lore. Low and behold, the show comes out and all my fears were realized. So many retcons, even of Bethesda's own additions from 3 and 4. Claiming that T60 power armour was used in the liberation of Anchorage, making ghouls dependent on a seemingly magical serum which keeps them from turning feral, changing what time the bombs dropped on the west coast, erasing the most important location Fallout has ever and will ever have lore wise (Shady Sands), reviving the west coast Brotherhood and turning them into a weird pseudo-Enclave military faction akin to what has been seen on the east coast, not to mention the fact that the west coast brother would NEVER fly an American flag, something they are seen doing in the show. The Brotherhood of Steel originating as a fraction of the US military, which seceded from the United States after finding out what was going on in Mariposa. Placing the TV show in California was seemingly a way for Bethesda to finally destroy the last remnants of Black Isles and Obsidian's work from the Fallout franchise. The show displays an obvious disregard for the lore of the universe and location in which it takes place.Furthermore, the show has some arguably ""cringy"" moments. Lucy using the term ""Raider"" to refer to the outsiders infiltrating vault 33; raider being a term developed and used by people living in the wasteland. How does she know to refer to them using this name, when she is shown to be as clueless about the outside world as not being familiar, and even spooked by a tumbleweed upon leaving the vault for the first time. There are also a couple of what I assume to be self inserts by the lead team of Bethesda. Two Vault-Tec employees are named Howard and Emil respectively, who I can only assume to be self inserts of Todd Howard and Emil Pagliarulo. Overall the show feels weirdly disrespectful of established west coast lore, more often than not ignoring it, if not outright retconning established, known facts."
1	I really enjoyed seasons 1-2 and was looking forward to watching the other seasons but I just can't get through season 3.Season 3 is basically political correctness and BLM being forced down your neck when you just want to sit back, relax, enjoy and watch a programme to forget about the world.It paints the police in a bad light even when they are trying to do the right thing which does not help their public image and can potentially turn more people against them even though in reality there are only a few bad police just like there are only a few bad people but unfortunately hate/despair/death is what sells in the media so that is all that's reported and made into a bigger issue than it is.I will try season 4 to see if it improves but I won't hold my breath.
1	"What is wrong with the one who plays Auggie?! Oh my gosh, I don't even think I should call her an ""actress"", coz she is so damn bad! She does not know how to act at all; everything with her is either so rigid and overdone! I actually quite enjoy the show, but whenever there is a scene with her, she just killed everything! I wonder how she got the role?!Some of the CGI are quite good, while some look a bit sloppy.I also think this is a pretty good adaptation considering all the elements and complicated structures in the novels.Give it a go if you like sci-fi, but I would suggest you either mute or fast forward all the scenes with Auggie."
0	So sad, i really can't remember in wich season they lost their spirit of this show, but they certanly did. I just want to see how shamefully they will finish this soap opera with no more spark in it. It's just money machine, nothing else. Finish this misery of Grey, because it became so ridiculous to watch her in this dream with Derek. Soooo lame. Grey doesn't represent show anymore for so long that i can't even remember when and she lost her spirit in it the long time ago.R.I.P.
1	Like... Seriously????THERE! That has better writing than the entire 8th season.
0	I actually found this series quite boring, i always doze off while watching it and have to rewind. All you see is people speaking Japanese. There's no entertainment value. This could have been a podcast and you wouldn't miss much. I can't believe people dare comparing this to Game of Thrones. Yes G. O. T. Is made of political intrigues and had a lot of dialogs but first we knew who was speaking and were familiar with their characters. G. O. T. Is a characters masterpiece. Furthermore G. O. T. Had epic battles, dragons, monsters etc. Shogun tricks the viewers by giving a little bit to make them believe more is there. In the first episode you have brief nudity for those who are into that and that's it. At the end of episode 2 you have 30 seconds of action to make you want to watch the next episode. But in fact there's not much happening. In the 3rd episode there is action but it's in the dark. Another trick by a cheap production because in the dark they don't have to worry too much about details. Also the big-headed, dead eyes actor who plays John Blackthorn is not very good. There are so many great British actors who would have nailed that part. I rated it 2 stars for the costumes and the sets but that's really all we've got here. This is no game of thrones. One episode of game of thrones cost more to make than this entire series.
0	Season 3 is an other victim of progressive ideology. Nothing more then propaganda. It seems like a production of '50-'60s of soviet Mosfilm producers from Kremlin mixed with Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution principles from '70s.Maybe America deserves that?
1	Far and away the best part of this 8-Part series is the first 15 minutes of Episode 1, but as realistic as they attempted to make the nuclear blasts seem, they still got that all wrong. And it was all downhill from there. I kept waiting for an intriguing plotline to develop from the several parallel stories presented, but no such luck. Alot of the set design on the surface had the feel of a low budget Mad Max film, and the scenes inside the vault played like big budget MST3K episode. Walton Goggins provided the only character of any discernable depth, and frankly provided the only dialogue in the whole eight-part series that was worth a damn. The rest of the characters were pretty much idiots. I can see from the other reviews that the series was a somewhat faithful adaptation of the video game, but that just tells me we need to stop using video games as source material for films and TV. 6/10.
1	Let me first say, I don't play video games. And I never even heard of this one. The trailer look interesting and when our 18 year old want to watch with us, well you take the offer. Secondly I like Last of Us. Thought it was interesting and after years of sloughing through the Walking Dead final seasons, was a better take on the zombie genre.Now to Fallout. The last of us, I felt I didn't need anything from the video game to understand the story. However Fallout, not so much. If you play the game you'll probably get it more than I did. Fallout is more fantastical than I like. The script seems weak, the characters are little odd acting, campy? Not sure. The story drags in huge parts. The score is off.Yes it's a pretty shot show. Nice camera work. Nice color saturation. However for this 53 year old, it just wasn't my thing.
0	"It felt like they wanted to please the TikTok audience and book readers at the same time. They pulled the cast from a random dating show and turned them into the worlds best scientists. The ""Oxford 5"" run around with the same facial expression, constantly drinking or crying, adding nothing to the show. Utterly ridiculous, just missing some fart jokes. It's an okay watch if you skip the scenes with the western scientists. The only acceptable bits about the show are the Chinese revolution and aftermath parts . Those are also the parts most resembling the books. The rest is just a lazy dumped down adaptation of one of the greatest scifi works."
0	Seriously, save yourself at least 3 hours, more like 9 hours of your life. The premise is interesting and from episode 2 to 4 it draws you in and makes you think this will be a great show. No doubt the book was good but Netflix and Hollywood have completely butchered this. It appears Netflix is suffering from the chaotic instability of the three-body problem and somehow managed to turn this from a well-regarded sci-fi book into a ridiculous 20 something teen. Nothing much happens over emotional bunch of garbage show that will just waste your time and make you wish actual aliens invaded us for the sins of Netflix.I rarely will leave a review but the last four episodes were just so goddamn bad. A. 6-year-old could have done a better job of writing the script here. Many of the characters were terribly cast and it wasn't just not believable, it just turned into being ridiculous. What a waste of time.
1	"Netflix did it once again. It's becoming an annoying habit.I must say Ripley starts FANTASTIC. During the first four episodes I was recommending the show to everyone I know. Details from Ripley's life in NY, which didn't appear in ""Talented Ripley"" with Matt Damon, were so well filmed and really contrasted with the scenes later in Italy, even if it's all black and white.Photography is outstanding throughout the whole show. It made me think the series would be one of the best I would ever see, it would become cult and soon they would be selling pictures and T-shirts with nice cuts from the show.The story builds up nice up until said fourth episode. (Even if Dickie and Freddie's characters felt a little miss in casting.)Then we start to feel like the original script had 5 or 6 episodes but Netflix needed 8. Or are they being paid by the episode? It gets really annoying to see how they stretch out every bit of scene they can (waiting for people to pick up the phone, showing weird interactions with receptionists, infinite scenes of a cat, all that doesn't add up to the story). Many characters acts also start not making sense, and the series loses rhythm.So you end up fast-forwarding the final episodes and feel once again a great story with immense potential was wasted.I wish Netflix stopped doing that.6/10."
0	Started ok, but typically badly written, where the bad guys always lose and the women cops always come out on top.
1	I wanted to and was hoping to really like this. I like good old Colin. The best part about this show is the opening 5 mins. First episode was interesting when he takes on the case. I don't know what it is about this show. It's just incredibly dull.As somebody else says it's trying to be a cross between LA Confidential and China town but with out the charm, the snappy PI dialogue of old.I'm going to go watch Maltese Falcon again, it at least inspired me to do that.It's a no from me.........I wanted to and was hoping to really like this.

1	All in all a good series. I love all most of the series but the end does not fit to the rest.
2	This type of show is the ones you don't want to miss out, it starts a little bit slow but now that I am all the way to the 8th episode I understand why, now I don't want it to end! The story is really good, the characters are great, the actors are brilliant! You get to know a little about their culture and is very interesting and we can learn (the good things) from them. I honestly didn't want to give it a 10 because I want to wait for the last episode, the reason I'm writing this before getting to the end is because I'm excited and wanted to share it so you guys won't miss it. Give it a try you will love this show I can assure you!
0	Interesting plot with clever elements. The original idea is a thrilling story with multiple dimensions that could have turned into a generational moment for sci fi fans, to the likes of Game of Thrones for instance. And in fact, the series started off strong, but quickly, as characters came into focus: the show became boring and hard to get committed into. The acting and the cast is simply not up to par to the size of this story. The dialogues are dull, the characters are shallow and the general acting is uncommitted. The director re-write into a western format sounds completely off. It's truly a shame because the book held so much potential, and this has been wasted by poor directing and mediocre casting.
2	Let me just start with clarifying that I have not read the books so I don't know if it's a good adaptation but as a show it is intriguing. While I have issues with some characters feeling lacking and the way they did things had me left wanting more tension overall there's a curiousity in me to know more.Now to me Episode 1-3 felt like an introduction... long one but I guess they needed that setup. It can get a bit dull even though some scenes had me wide eyed. Episode 4 is the start of the hook and episode 5 reels you in... so if you're thinking about the show I suggest to push through til episode 5 and if you didn't like what it wants to show then drop it.Shout out to those who made the title sequence because I love it. Also showing some love to my favorite characters: Liam Cunningham as Thomas Wade, Sea Shimooka as Sophon, and Marlo Kelly as Tatiana!Warning: Gore, nudity.
1	I was initially put off when I saw how much it deviated from the original storyline in the first few episodes. Was looking for Wang Miao (male lead character of book 1) and realised Auggie was meant to be him. Multiple plotlines were over-generalised and characters condensed to fit into the Netflix 8-episode format. However, there were some entertaining merits to the way the story was tweaked, which comes across as an attempt to make it more bite-sized (or dumbed-down) for audiences that have not read the books. Several of the key plots in the second and third books (which were meant to happen in different time periods) were mashed into this first season, which does not do the full story justice, since it is meant to span centuries.Ultimately I do feel entertained though, as this series took out some dramatic parts of the books to play out using the Hollywood machinery, with the downside of ignoring several other character plots that were essential the whole plot. The character of Luo Ji for example, was only revealed to be congruent to Saul in the last episode, and the whole transition felt like a desperate attempt to mish mash every actor's importance to draw relevance to the trilogy's readerbase.I hope season 2 onwards can start to veer back more to the original storyline.
2	This gorgeous, moody period piece is a lovely character study, slightly unnerving at times as the camera invites you into the mind of a man without morales and we experience with him envy and desire. Shot all in black and white we are deliberately steered away from the obviously beautiful to marvel at the ambiguous and worry when naivete leads our characters into danger or corruption. A really good understated performance from Johnny Flynn, though I prefer Matt Damon's version of Ripley this series gives a grittier feel to a still compelling piece of story telling. Makes me want to watch the original film again. Beware the wolf in the fairytale!
0	"If you're looking for a dark, gritty, post apocalyptic fallout show stay far, far away. Right when you get pulled in by the gorgeous set design you immediately get pulled right back out by stiff acting, or marvel'esque comedy bits. This is a ""theme park"" type show. Theres a ton of modern day messaging under a thin veneer of a ""post apocalyptic world"" that also pulls one out extremely easily. Bethesdas influence on this show is very apparent. That fallout 4 assault rifle was tragic. Over a hundred years after the bombs fell and nobody has tried to rebuild in a serious way? Shady sands anyone? Stay far, far away from this normie slop if you have any reverence for the source material."
2	"With all game adaptations you go in holding your breath and expecting the worst but this doesn't disappoint at first you can see it becoming another mundane experience. This is soon proven otherwise as you're plunged into the world of fallout with gritty conflict and a complex plot my only complain is the lack of content in such a large universe of lore they've filled a lot of it with walking and some ""Easter eggs"", they have set up an enjoyable show as well as the base to continue a successful video game adaptation which makes a nice change. Hopefully this will have a promising future and explore more of the fallout lore and some of the niche characters."
2	The amount of actor change ruins the overall experience. What really shocks me is the starting scene, where her father gets tortured, killed by her own relatives, because of being brainwashed by communism ideology. That really makes me disgust of communism, but I respect revolutionaries. Putting this movie in simple is shocking and futuristic, the way the girl had chose to answer the signal, is a way that I believe most people, would choose, because of so much disappointment. The environment of the movie pressurizes the girl to choose the way, but it's the same in the reality, this movie is the real warning towards society, that now environment can make a very huge impact to the young generations now, scientist are not being heard much but influencers are being the top of the interest among young people, scientist now had been becoming lesser influence each year, that only a major incident happened could make us people feel the existence of scientist. Overall not a bad movie, shocking views and I recommend to CHINA Chinese to see, watch, and not brainwashed by all the parties, they should understand and not being covered by all these mess the government had created, this is a movie targeted to Chinese, that I must say the environment creates people, edits people, changes people.
1	Not quite respect to the original novel. It is true that the novel is such complicated to be visualised and be filmed. It is true that TV series will do some editorial on the plot based on the novel. However, it seems far beyond. To most of fans of the novel, the episode losses respects to the origin. It is nearly to re-write a plot with the concept of three body problem. Thus, it shouldn't be named as three body problem.As a Chinese, watching the episodes, just feel that Netflix only take shots of the part that Chinese creators aren't able to shoot in China if they want to publish in plublic. Other than that, it isn't the three body problems.It seems to extend the vision, however, it narrows the big concept of what the author wants to express.
2	"After s03 most of episodes are recorded with action cams and ""shop"" cams.That is not necessary cause we don't want to loose some details of the series."
2	So thought-provoking. This was very good, but it's a perfect example of something that should have drawn more from the original script. Too many significant changes, in my opinion. And, the game should have appeared more as a game. The characters being exactly themselves, just in different clothes, didn't really convey the understanding of what it was like in there. And they didn't spend nearly enough time in the game or with the countdown or with Ye Wenjie's background, or pretty much anything. They would have done better with 10 or 12 episodes and let us more enjoy and savor each stage. The original Three-Body is long (30 episodes) and in Chinese, but this version is missing so much detail I now realize was important to the overall story. Watch this and enjoy it, but try to find the time to watch the original.
2	Seasons 1 and 2 were interesting and fun. I'm sure this isn't real life for LA Police but the stories were good and you cared about the characters. Some of it was a bit far fetched but it was entertaining and believable (mostly). My rating is for season 1 and 2.I'm assuming at the end of season 2 either all the writers and senior staff were changed or they all had a stroke or head injuries because this show starts spiralling downhill fast in season 3. By the start of season 4 the story is absolutely ridiculous and the rookies have become Seal Team 6 (sorry guys probably quite insulting to you).So .. worth watching seasons 1 and 2 and then pretend that's where it finished.
0	This is one series that is just not very good. All the scientists are self-centered drug addicts and drunks who always go around partying. If you believe any of this drivel, I have a bridge in Brooklyn you will be interested in buying. Really, this is such a silly slow show I am not sure why people like it, unless they are so starved for a quality show this is the best of the worst. I will let others decide. If you are a adolescent with a low IQ this may be believable to you. But if you have any brains at all you will soon realize this is all about suspense and nonsense where reality does not exist.
1	"If you like it great keep watching it I honestly don't care I'm just gonna list off reasons why I don't like loving a series that seems to be retconning/resetting all the past things they've created for something new that seems lame or same old cliche.Apparently the NCR isn't around anywhere in Cali; I'm 4 episodes in and I haven't seen a trace of them in any society function. Its only been 15-20 years since NV. They would be like Roman Empire, broken but into pieces more than anything. Nope its just people in tin shacks.Turning the BoS into this edgy london Knight/Lord theme. Yes their titles are Knight/Elder/Scribe/etc however I've never once seen them have dialogue like this show does. Its hammered into them since either birth in the bunkers or if we're going east coast then since they join.I'm not crazy of Lucy being the center not cause shes a bad actor but because I would of enjoyed her more if they simply either gave her smaller lines or mute to transition a RPG character almost just being dragged along in the story like most do.The writing is basic, people act like this is masterpiece writing but it isn't. They've done the father/son/daughter thing now 3 times.Fallout 3/4 and now this show. Its getting old. Oh but guess what the vault's waterchip is busted where else have I seen this.The world is bland, feels like they spent most of the budget on actors/costumes and thats about it. Theres one ""settlement"" if you wanna call it that and its somehow worse than megaton. Again in Cali where NCR had a full fledged nation happening."
0	I really really wanted to like this. I have read all of James Clavell's novels and I have seen the original series starring Richard Chamberlain and so I'm a huge fan of Shogun, that is the original story. But I am struggling to recognise much of this series, it looks great and the language and subtitles thing are not an issue for me, but I find it hard to follow and find myself losing interest and I doubt I will continue watching after this last episode 4. I don't understand why they have done this to this great story, the main character is awful, he annoys me more than any other aspect of this series. The only saving grace is the actor who plays Toranaga, he steals every scene he is in, but no matter how good the actors may or may not be, the story line is a mess and my advice is read the book, or watch the original series.
1	Loud raucous music every 15 seconds, smart-alecy cops that look like models, no pace setting in the narrative. This will appeal to the most avid TV junkies who watch more American television that anything else. In the hands of a more assured director this could have been a lovely show, because if one persists through the juvenile narrative style, the plots and characters aren't that bad. Some of them are even interesting and relatable. It surely isn't an 8 out of 10 rating as it currently shows on IMDB. A decent watch for slow periods between shows. At the moment Netflix, Amazon and HBO are rocking the production values in top shows in addition to stuff coming from Europe.
0	Game of Thrones is an intricate and interesting story that thrives off of shock, titillation, and disgust. It brings out the worst of human emotions within the characters and is a poor influence on the minds of its watchers (people who mostly just want an epic fantasy). The attention that this series has gained is an unfortunate reflection on our society. While I can understand the allure of such an expansive world with many amazing qualities of a good fantasy, I cannot personally support a series that makes light of nudity, women, rape, and violence. My rating is for the quality of the story as well as the cinematography. I hope that people everywhere will recognize the effects that this series has on their thoughts and emotions as they become immersed in this filth. I also hope that parents will recognize the importance of avoiding bringing these sorts of influences into the home.
0	This old guy is not remotely convincing as Riply. Andrew Scott is so so boring, the first episode drags from the outset, the conversation with Greenleaf Snr absolutely laughable. Honestly the writing is pig swill. Tom is gormless, there is so much filler waiting for buses walking up & down stairs the tedious language difficulties the encounter with Dickie on the beach.....what? If he went out of his way to ensure DG would kick him to the kerb immediately as of no account he could not have done more. And he is so old did I say that? What does he bring to the table, like literally and figuratively....absolutely nothing, no polish charm cleverness why would Marge and Dickie give him the time of day, it even renders Johnny Flynn dull flat lifeless. Im 100% not spending any more time on this. Over & out.
2	A brilliant series and outstanding performances particularly Gunning (aka Martha) - she definitely brings stalking to a whole new level, sinister and powerful throughout. It's not so much the subject matter however, that bothers me but the fact it's based on true events.Donny (Gadd), at first comes across as a decent character but it's not long before one realises that his meek tendencies get slightly infuriating. He's annoying and it does get extremely difficult, as revelations unfold, for one to empathise with quite the selfish person he himself tends to be.I came away thinking that Gadd, indeed to a certain level, has his own mental health issues bordering on masochistic and mildly narcissistic (which was probably why he fell victim to what seemed so many unnecessary situations!) Talk about wanting him to give him a slap!That said all the subject matters portrayed were disturbing, uneasy to view and mystifying. A must watch.
0	I watched the original 1980's series and really enjoyed it so was pleased to see it had been remade. With great anticipation I watched the new series, or at least so far. Only finding the there is, and a further search later, finding that there was never any intention of completing the whole book... Tell me, what is the point. Let's just do up to act 2 of a 3 act play, or perhaps Obi Wan being murdered by Darth Vader then stopping filming. This along with the earlier series The Borgias is just pathetic. In future I will await a completed product before investing my time in a half cocked production. Cheers, Paul.
2	This kind of serials would easily makes me feel attached with all the characters... and the story on every episodes is always varies with sufficient action accompanied with many moral story behind them... nice ...
1	"Well , well, I gave it a 6/10.. This movie use to be my favorite movie. I use to love it. But unfortunately it became a soap opera. There were characters I loved and started really not liking them and characters I hated and started liking them. Everybody is sleeping over with everybody and they are cheating, it has lack of moral values, it's not about the doctors ob anymore to do it right or to show the best out of them, it's about the doctor's lives which is in my opinion so pointless and low. This movies should teach something, like taking responsibility for your actions and especially on a job like doctors have, but it's the the other way around.Well, the way the 3d season has ended and they way they have complicated things, I just am not interested in season 4 anymore. I hope still..that it won't become like ""Hercules"" or ""Xena"" which were really great at the beginning and than both of the movies became a joke.. but the way they seem to have given me ideas at the last episode of season 3.. I just feel it's going to be the same!I still gave it a 6 because I did like it at the beginning and there where episodes that made me cry.It's sad though that they've kind of slipped out of the real idea and the theme of the movie"
2	I haven't read the original book,so I don't know much about details. But after I finished my watching,I think the experience was beyond my expectation. Dr. Ye's sad past, the worries and fears brought by Santi civilization to mankind, and the love between Cheng Jin and her boyfriend was just amazing. Still it has some bad aspects. Its narrative pace and plot progress are too fast, and the changes to the main characters are too large. The story itself was also been reorganized,so some plot were missing,which could be barriers for you to understand each character deeply. Despite of these bad things,it is without doubt a good TV series nowadays.
0	"What can I say. It's like Journey without Steve Perry. Ohh sure they can sort of duplicate the voice, but the good song writing went right out the window. Ohh sure if you look at older Journey albums practically ever song has Co-writing credits, one guy leaves and suddenly...no hits! The guy himself goes on to write a few, but his former band suddenly can't buy one! The results speak for themselves.Same thing here, Whomever took these rich characters and storylines by Martin just isn't up to the task of completing the series well. It was a whole bunch of smashed together vignettes of the Starks going off to their various fates.Some people might like the way Snow killed Daenerys. I thought it was ridiculous. She suddenly dropped all her guard and acted like Snow was just going to be Prince Charming to her Snow White. She SHOULD have been guarded and Snow SHOULD have had to convince her it was going to be alright and then killed her. Instead she was all smiles. Totally out of character.When Sansa declared she would rule her own kingdom the others just accepted that? Bwahahahaha. Especially Greyjoy, like she would play nice. ""Well we like Daenerys, but if you all want this, OK"" Does that seem anything like her?It could have ended after the first fade to black, but returned time and again for at least 15 minutes.After everything you've seen up till now, does anybody think the Unsullied and the Dalthraci would NOT put up with Jon Snow and Lannister surviving? That they would just accept the will of the people? They literally hate all the people!I don't know exactly what happened. My guess? Martin is not suffering from severe writers block. He tried to hold out for a big payday and HBO went on without him. We're being fed a PR story and this was the end result."
1	I went in with low expectations but was pleased to see it was fun and engaging. I was especially happy to see they didn't make Lucy another Mary Sue.However, now I have watched the whole season I feel it's been let down by bar writing, especially in the area of character motivations, and without going into details that might cause spoilers I would say that the ending will absolutely fiddle with the timeline and canon of the games now - despite what the shows creators said about making an unrelated and original story in the official world.But with all that said I think it's worth a watch if you don't think about it too much - it has the dark humour of the games, the retro-futuristic look (mostly anyway) and it certainly kept me watching all the way through.
0	While I appreciate the idea that good guys don't always win, I don't need to watch something where the bad guys almost always do. There is enough bad news in real life to spend my time watching fictional attempts at depressing a viewer.
1	I never watched this show until recently when I was laid up after surgery. Binged on all seasons over a month and a half. The show has plenty of sex and violence but the narrative is rich even with well-developed characters. The show, in my opinion, peaked during mid season and the last two seasons have been very uneven. Too much filler. Season 8 has been somewhat of a disappointment. At this point I think the writers are simply to end with some sort of resolution for the many characters and storylines and it feels rushed. I think HBO's Westworld is superior (at least the first season) as well as Starz's Counterpart. As to who wins the iron throne, it is anybody's guess but my bet is on the Dragon Queen. Jon Snow is already dead and will probably die a noble second death saving his queen. One of the characters has to die and why not kill the one who was already dead?
1	"Now I don't know if I'll watch anymore since they've killed 2 of my favorite characters for no reason other than cruelty. I realized partway into the last episode that George was going to depart the show. And given how the last several episodes had gone, Izzie might also have left for any number of reasons... simple, easy to understand reasons. After the brain glitching I felt the most likely departure would be that she retained none of her medical training, but any kinder story could have been written here. They already HAD a kinder - even heroic - exit for George formulated... then killed him with a bus. That the writers chose to be particularly cruel to the two people they had built up the most over the first five seasons, I'm unlikely to watch another episode. Seems to have been written by a rather sadistic crew that wants you to sympathise with and be tho most fond of the people they intend to mistreat in the worst ways possible. If there is some ""artistic"" point to that approach, I don't see it, and I don't appreciate it. No matter how many seasons are written on,, there's just no redeeming the writers on this. Best wishes to Bailey I hope you find a way to survive the series, but I'm not going to know. Well having her family torn apart in that last episode was a pretty bullying thing to do as well. I'd rather not find out how much worse they'll make thins for her before it's all over."
1	I haven't read the book, nor seen the Chinese series, which now I wish I had.This starts out ostensibly as a pure sci-fi piece and shows a lot of potential and promise.The premise with better than average production, direction, cinematography and finer details all make up for captivating, enchanting and curious viewing.The story begins with a series of flashbacks which set up the rest of the story: a victim of Mao's cultural revolution is recognised as a brilliant physicist and employed to work in a state of the art, top secret astronomy station, where she deduces how to amplify radio frequencies that results in a message from outer space, warning her not to respond, yet she does.The early episodes are replete with suspense, mystery and the overarching thrilling science fiction plot,which slowly reveals itself- until annoyingly, it meanders into territory exploring the sanctity of human life and love.Many of the characters, as previous reviewers have spotted, seem and feel deliberately cast by looks, tokenism and forced DEI, with the women largely playing the saviours, moral arbitrator's and ethical righteousness in the face of the war-mongering, unfeeling patriarchal establishment.Ultimately the story is about a race for survival between a distant alien species and ourselves. This forces humanity to look inwards, which is badly mishandled by the creators with the Oxford five serving as representatives of that inner search; resembling more of a soap opera than boldly exploring any existential philosophy or similar themes.They ( santi ) have already made contact and are able to recruit a small number of devotees who are dedicated to ensuring their safe arrival.Superior technology and communication is used to sabotage Earth's most cutting edge quantum physics projects and scientists in order for the santi to maintain their technological edge.A vetting process via a futuristic VA headset is used to recruit the best and brightest minds to join the small but powerful sect of followers led by Mike Evans, an entrepreneur ( Jonathan Pryce).The performances are adequate yet somewhat flat.Rosalind Chao and Jess Hong play their parts well with Benedict Wong and Liam Cunningham adding some mild humour, yet there really isn't any stand outs.The character of 'Auggie' played by Eiza González is one of the most unrealistic, irritating, repugnant and repulsive I've witnessed in awhile.Her constant pouting, tantrums and bitter solipsism makes her almost unwatchable.Coupled together with what South Park coined 'put a chick in it' serves only to detract and distract this viewer from connecting to any of the characters. She's not only unwatchable but unbelievable. Perhaps if she were twenty years older...A grave mistake was made focusing so much time on the human themes of love and value of human life when the initial premise made for much greater storytelling.It's not only trite, it assumes audiences are not able to follow a story based on hard science and philosophy of science-which should have been the main plot points, rather than the pointless wranglings about right and wrong which the protagonists keep falling into.Despite all of this series obvious flaws, it does have some interesting, redeeming moments making it a worthwhile watch.Those giving it a 10 with their ecstatic reviews And labeling those who vote down as idiots who just don't get it, fail to understand the gross mishandling of such a promising story and how frustrating that can be.In fact those who vote it down while recognising its potential probably do so with a heavy sense of disappointment and reluctant cynicism.
0	I really like Colin Farrell, this show is a preposterous slog, it's a snoozefest, the dialogue between him and the girl is absolutely nutso, once again someone wrote a whack fake noir story where I guess we're psychic and are supposed to know about some ludicrous, yeah ludicrous and preposterous storyline with the two barely making sense because we don't know how they know each other but oh that's supposed to be cool and the relationship can't be taken seriously in any way shape or form, ho hum ho hum deedely dumb!, the girl with the supposedly cool nose ring can't get across the role, yeah but what is her role anyway and why is sugar ha funny that's the whole show the name and Colin Farrell's studly face because apparently he forgot how to act too maybe the girl left him void of spirit, this.show.has.no.spirit.nor.soul oh me oh my oh, pass on it, I couldn't get through the first convo between she and he because who cares?, believe it or not my meandering pseudo review review is more interesting, argh said Charlie Brown.Addendum - apparently someone doesn't like my review but read some of the pro reviews online... they, uh, agree with me and I with them about this show being a miss!, of course some people like it, such is life, why disparage me as having problems because I didn't like this show?, peace out.
2	The series is so different from what an American or European eye knows. On the other hand, it's also so familiar and incredibly good. It is precisely this Japanese stranger that makes this series so exciting The scenery and costumes in particular are incredible and chosen with great attention to detail. Shogun maintains its high standard and skillfully conveys the cultural peculiarities of Japanese culture at the time. I'm incredibly excited about the story without any prior knowledge, Disney is finally bringing out a somewhat new series. The subtitles are a little annoying, but I got used to them pretty quickly. Game of Thrones in Japan.
2	In this 10-episode series we are led to side with the character of Toranaga, a Japanese lord whose life, and the life of everyone in his corner, is at risk at the hands of the other ruling regents. The way the show depicts Toranaga at first is the classic take on a strongwilled man, who is vilified because he is too much of a risk to the remainder of the ruling parties. The five men were supposed to rule in unison until the king comes of age, however, one man seems to go against the will of the other four and therefore is persecuted. We are led to believe that the four regents are the vile and egoistical ones, giving in to greed and foreign christian influence over the wellbeing of their own people. Lord Toranaga, on the other hand, supposedly goes against this, wishing to survive and bring prosperity with his vision.This carefully crafted image shatters in the last minutes of episode 8 and subsequently in ep 10. The man plays the underdog, pretends he is ready to give up so that his followers are all the more riled up and urge him to fight on. He gaslights his generals into signing an agreement to give up, he has his most trusted advisor and lifelong friend commit seppuku as part of his plan. He sacrifices lady Mariko into giving her life to him as well, so that he can free hostages who are on his side and manipulate the king's mother into assisting him. He then orders for the Anjin's ship to be burned and tortures the whole village, killing innocent people, pretending to be looking for the culprits of the burning, all as a twisted test to see how the Anjin would behave. He claims to be humble, to be ready to sacrifice himself for the good of the realm. He is not. He is ruthless, trecherous, absolutely obsessed with power, holding human life in no regard, killing people at whim. And the worst of it all, he will kill off anyone in his circle, be it his loyalists or regular villagers, just to prove a point. There is nothing noble about this man.This series leaves you wondering whether you have been rooting for the wrong side all along and feeling that all of this 10-hour investment has been wasted. Especially that, after you learn of Toranaga's villainy, there is absolutely no follow up to see how the other characters react to this man having his way and what the fallout of all this is to the general people.
0	I understand people loved the game, I gave it a couple of hours back in the day and moved on... thinking now I possibly didn't give it enough of a chance. Or maybe I'm just lazy?... I gave this show a couple of hours and didn't mind what I saw. Gave it a couple more and started to enjoy it. A couple hours later (like ep6, 7, and 8) I was hooked and sad there were no more episodes to watch. One of the better shows I've come across in the last few years. Good acting, well written scripts and twists I didn't see coming 2 episodes before they happen. Can't wait for season 2. Although I'm sure that's a long way off. 😟 thinking maybe I'll dust off my PS3 and give it another look?
1	Once Sandra Oh left the show, I barely have reason to watch. Chandra Wilson! Otherwise the story lines are not as suspenseful. Replacing Yang with sister Shepherd was poor. Just bringing on a daughter for Richard was interesting. Story with Meredith losing her hearing was good. Otherwise ho hum. What happened, writers???
0	Grey Anatomy is a soap opera. Deliciously addicting and good at it's job, but a soap opera. There are few good actors, and few realistic plots. Very little character arcs or development and disable main characters,
0	GOT was my absolute favorite show ever and up until S8 I considered this show to be nearly perfect. It was the best viewing experience of anything I'd ever seen in my life. That was until S8 completely destroyed the entire series. S8 ignores all 7 previous seasons of material and destroys everything the show has been building up to for 10 years. It is so heartbreaking that I am now in a depression. I used to recommend this show to everyone I know and now I can't anymore. The payoff just isn't worth watching. There is no point of watching the 65+ episodes of brilliance to get to the disastrous final season and be heartbroken. The most important episode...the Apex of the whole series...the one episode the entire show has been building up to for 10 years was absolutely terrible. So unbelievably disappointing.
0	You will watch him repeat the same scene over and over, walking up and down stairs , checking in to hotels ,checking out of hotels , being at the bank , having boring dead conversations. 8 hours of stretching out 2 hour of story . I made it to episode five then i could not take it anymore . Plus, I dont care for him or anyone else in the movie . I can see that its good acting and they probably put a lot of effort into this movie and I can like slow not just 8 hours of slow . I almost never leave a review but I want to warn people about this series .The girlfriend is completely dead of any personality .A group of realy boring people for 8 hours .Only thing I truly enjoyed was when he smashed the head of that enoying friend of dicky. I am irritated i spent five hours of my Saturday on this. The great reviews kept me going even if my better judgment told me from the start that this series is not for my taste .
0	I found this unbelievably boring. None of the actors are stand out & the annoying bargain basement Richard Burton accent of the lead actor grates.The original casting in the 1980s tv series was knock down stellar with Lady Mariko practically carrying the whole series. This time round she looks & sounds like a flat toned American actress pretending to be Japanese.Lord Toronaga was played by Toshiro Mafuni in the original - no one could ever replace him. As for Lord Yabu, he was so larger than life I couldn't wait for him to show up on the screen in the original - Freddy Takai was amazing. All these actors were utterly believable even if the story was rolled out slowly.How can Shogun be boring??? Terrible script, uninspiring actors, non descript characters that's how. Go back & watch the original tv series if you want to really engage with this story.
0	"It started really well, great performances etc... but then got confused in what it wanted to be. A comedy? A dark self dystopian dysfunction? Or a social commentary... didn't work trying to be all of them. As a thick threaded telling of one of the genres, it may well have pulled this viewer deeper, instead, with its decision to be a mix, it simply left me floating on the surface, not particularly bothered, and not about to go diving deeper. Rape needs to be presented with care and consideration of how it will be perceived, here it just seemed to be added on to give a reason for the protagonist to be ""messed up"". There was no exploration or condemnation of that harrowing experience. It was just ""there""."
2	"Straight of the bat, there as some inconsistencies with the story, such as with the time periods and certain character placements within those periods but beyond that, the series is rather palpable in that regard. Oh, and expect to ignore the ""science"" in this show, because it makes almost zero sense... Perhaps that's intentional given the story... It's quite off putting when the physics of the show is literally contrary to how modern physics depicts it with literally no explanation as to why. You need a great suspension of disbelief to enjoy the show, particularly with how the Sun works.The only other criticism I could muster is that some characters suffer from being 2 dimensional, showing little to no deviation in their portrayal of said characters. It's not a train smash but I did find my self skipping those scenes but it was quite boring and detracting from what was an otherwise thrilling watch.I only wish the series took the liberty of expanding upon the story with what the Russian and American scientists initially discovered and their reaction to the discovery too. Since it wasn't just an exclusive broadcast to China."
2	Really enjoying this show! Nathan F is showing his talent through awesome transitional skills. It's amazing how different his character is.Great Job Rookie team!!! Keep it going!!!Definitely worth watching
0	Why? Because the ending sucks.. don't waste your time the entire season has no purpose or connection with the ending.
0	The Budget for this show was $153 million. You could of given any Fallout fan the budget and they would have made a better show, In fact, there already is a better fan-made Fallout show and it's called Nuka Break (Check it out).Obviously, when a video game show or movie gets made Fans are going to be upset because we already know it will be corporate slop that's not true to the game, so no one or myself is really that surprised. But, the Fallout universe is huge, many games across many years and a plethora of lore to work with.They could have made an awesome show from the source material, Instead we get politically correct virtue signaling in a post apocalyptic setting with a Fallout label slapped on it.It lacks the raw, gritty helplessness that the games are known for. This show is more Whimsical, and probably would have been better as a new, original IP without using the Fallout name.
1	"In Netflix's latest adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's classic viewers might find themselves both intrigued and perplexed. The show, a noir-esque rendition that certainly does justice to its visual aesthetics, unfortunately falters on more substantive grounds.Firstly, the casting choices present a glaring issue. Andrew Scott, portraying Tom Ripley, is noticeably older than his literary counterpart, a discrepancy painfully obvious in the show's crisp black and white visuals. The original novel, along with the acclaimed 1999 film, depicts a youthful ensemble of characters in their mid-twenties. However, in this adaptation, while Freddie (played by the talented non-binary child of Sting, Eliot Sumner) skews younger, the rest, including Tom, are markedly older. This age gap is more than a superficial oversight; it fundamentally alters the dynamics and relatability of the characters.Secondly, the series misses crucial plot elements that added depth to the original narrative. Both Highsmith's novel and the 1999 film subtly showcased Dickie Greenleaf as a charming yet fickle playboy, a detail that Marge Sherwood, his on-off love interest, is acutely aware of. This aspect of Dickie's character adds a layer of complexity to the storyline, especially during police investigations and Marge's reactions to Dickie's disappearance. Unfortunately, ""Ripley"" devotes considerable screen time to prolonged, albeit artistically shot, scenes, such as the one on the boat, at the expense of these crucial character dynamics. This narrative choice represents a missed opportunity to enrich the story with the original's subtleties.Lastly, the show falters in its depiction of Tom Ripley's transformation. In the novel, Tom's obsession with Dickie manifests in a gradual assumption of his identity, mannerisms, and even physical appearance. This metamorphosis is central to the plot and Tom's psychological journey. The series, despite ample runtime across its eight episodes, fails to convincingly portray this transformation. While there are instances of Tom impersonating Dickie, the depiction lacks consistency and depth, particularly in visual cues like Tom's hairstyle, which remains static throughout the series.Another notable issue is the series' altered and abrupt ending. Deviating from the original novel and film, this change diminishes the psychological complexity and moral ambiguity that are hallmarks of the Ripley narrative. The shortened conclusion leaves a sense of incompleteness due to the omission of the original's impactful closure.While the series has its shortcomings, the acting prowess of the Italian talent cannot go unmentioned. Their performances add a layer of authenticity and vibrancy to the show, capturing the essence of Highsmith's world with remarkable depth and nuance. Their contributions stand as a highlight in the adaptation, infusing it with moments of genuine emotion and cultural richness.In conclusion, while the series offers a unique take on the classic story, it's a take that, in many ways, strays too far from its roots, losing much of the original's charm and complexity in the process."
0	Really wasn't very interesting. I'd recommend not wasting your money on watching it if you can avoid it. The characters are great actors, but the plot line is actually very basic in the end. Good guy wants justice, bad guy wins. With so many stories of so many kingdoms, one would think something decent and happy was going on. Granted, they pop a wedding or two in now and then, but even those end up in massacre and death. So...I end my review with explaining the next chapters of the game: Part 1 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. Part 2 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. Part 3 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. Part 4 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. Part 5 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. Get the point?
1	"Although I quite dislike Matt Damon, what was interesting about his ""talented Mr Ripley"" was the ingenuity of his plans and his impression skills (as far as I can remember). As much as I love the Fleabag priest, this Mr Ripley has no talent whatsoever. Doesn't plan ahead, his impressions sound just like himself (I mean the character - I do know the actor is Irish), and don't even get me started on his ""disguise"". He keeps getting away by fluke or by police incompetence, not by talent, which gave me a ""meh"" feeling (this is not a spoiler, I haven't watched how it ends yet). Casting wasn't great either inasmuch it would make more sense for the dilettante young men to be in their late twenties (late thirties tops). Also, the black and white cinematography seemed completely gratuitous to me. Didn't add anything to the story or to the experience of watching this series, actually it took away the expressiveness and the meanings that colors could convey. Despite all that, it's a watchable series, especially if you miss the priest as much as I do. And Lucio was quite entertaining too. Rated it 7 because IMDB doesn't allow me to rate it a 6,8."
1	The only thing separating this show from being the greatest of all time is the awful 6 episode Conclusion that we waited 2 years for.Unfortunately this show will get thrown into the Pile with Lost, True Blood, How I met your mother and many others that were fantastic and were done in by horrible endings.
0	"Each week, I mark The Rookie for recording, looking forward to absorbing the collaborative efforts of the people portrayed. I begin the recording and, a couple of minutes in, have to tune away because of the horrifically loud noise (some might call it music) idiots have added to the new shows. Remember when there were many efforts made to lower the heightened nuisance noise of commercials? Well, now we have that same nuisance added to a show that I would otherwise enjoy. Fire the idiots and the very poor management who put together an unbearable hiccup that neither adds nor, in any way, enhances the experience.The addition to tv shows of background music (even though much lower in volume than that in The Rookie) that overrides the dialogue seems to be a ""thing"" these days. It detracts from the story and most often drowns out the dialogue. Please, fire the idiots so that the stories again become clear."
1	In the beginning of Grey's Anatomy, the show was very entertaining. The characters and the plot itself was unique. The show had so many surprises and entertainments that had viewers inclined to watch more. Additionally, the comedy in Grey's Anatomy was at its peak as well. However, as the show progressed, it started getting prolonged for no reason. For instance, the original characters of Grey's Anatomy have almost all left. The loss of the originals and the addition of new individuals make the show hard to watch. For instance, Cristina leaving the show could have led to the show ending, especially since the show was based on Cristina's and Meredith's friendship. Her leaving (and other characters) has definitely made me lose interest in the show. Especially now that Meredith is leaving, I hope that show ends on a good note since now it is does not give the vibes it gave from the beginning of the show.
1	If you have seen the movie from 1999 with Matt Damon and Jude Law, there's not much new to be had here. The eight-part series is the exact same story with the exact same twists. In the series some things are left out however, like Dickie impregnating a local woman, who ends up killing herself.For example: In the movie the boat sequence lasts 4-5 minutes. In the series it lasts more than half an hour using a lot of filler shots and close-up shots of Andrew Scott looking intense.All actors do a great job, but I'm not buying the triangle of friendship, where one looks like a 50-year old (Tom), the other 30 (Dickie) and the third a teenager (Freddie). That's not good casting.The series is beautifully lensed and the black and white suits the noir atmosphere perfectly. But I would have loved some twists on a story I already know.
0	"I never want to be that person that says ""Books are still better"". But I'm being now, sorry.I love the books, they are pretty great.This show is not.Except the main essence of the plot, everything else is different.They apparently hate so much the first book that they rush past 60-70% of it in the first 3 episodes. And that is just sad.Something I don't think I ever saw in a book adaptation, is that they split the main character from the book into five people in the show. It's usually other way around. And it's done so ridiculous, they split a chinese scientist dad with a wife and a kid into a Beneton ad cliche - millenial team of a latino woman, asian woman, black man, chunky englishman and white dude with cancer. But even more bizzarely - those same characters then started to mutate into characters from the second book. I don't know what to think about it honestly.What I do know, there is no mystery, tension, thriller, only those characters, being dragged through main plot while they deal with their petty BS.You can fault chinese series for some things but they at least kept it fairly close to the first book and made an okay show, if not one a bit too long and complicated at times with some elements omited/whitewashed. But it worked.This is not that. It's worse compared to that show that came one year ago and it's far worse than the books it's ""loosely"" based on.A lot of people say Benioff/Weiss failed in finishing Game of Thrones because they had no source material to rely on so they improvised. Well they had it here and they still bungled it up. Most things are made subpar, acting, characters, plot is flatlined, even music is 10 shades of gray whatever stuff. A lot of things went unexplained or explained badly, brushed off, especially some core science stuff which play a big role in the plot. That somewhat shows what creators think about their audience.There is no sense of wonder, no amazement, no character development. It's not smart, funny, trippy or visually appealing - CGI is nothing to write home about. It's pretty lame and cliche filled affair tailored for modern western audiences that just consume and don't demand quality for their money. So, Netflix subscribers.I don't know, you can watch it, it's disappointing. You can watch chinese series, it's better, longer. But I would recommend books every time."
1	"I've been a long-time Fallout fan, played the crap out of FO1 and 2 back in highschool, enjoyed Fallout Tactics. Got hyped up by Fallout 3 when Bethesda took over, played hundreds of hours in Fallout 4 and slowly lost my enthusiasm after 76 fiasco.Kinda sad, that such a huge franchise with such a rich lore ended up being downsized to incoherent flood of in-game references connected by yet another abysmal script. I have a feeling that writers haven't played anything other than fallout shelter before writing screenplay.Lots of things barely make any sense in the setting, especially when it comes to vaults and their inhabitants.It's passable as a rainy/snowy day time killer, but not something that I personally would consider a good film adaptation. Heck, some indie shorts on youtube did a better job at capturing a ""spirit"" of Fallout, while this show only focused on visually appearing ""fallout-y""."
1	Too many social diatribes. No longer entertaining.
0	Unfortunately, it appears as if the directors, producers, and writers did not...or must not have...read the novel. It was a very long time ago that I read Shogun...and perhaps a bit less time...that I watched the TV mini series (in the 80's, I believe). The novel and the TV mini series were excellent in every way. This 2024 version is not at all up to those standards. It's harsh and mean and without any of the class of the first mini series. There are some good performances, especially the person who plays Toranaga, but they are too few. The lead character, Pilot or Anjin, is aweful. He mopes around like a hulking monster. There are no redeeming qualities with this lead...as opposed to the novel and mini series. The dialogue is dyslexic and the plot is tiresome. Wish I could finish this version but I can't...it lacks style, it's too mean, and it's just plain dull.
1	First 5 seasons are awesome. Then it's just a downfall but I kept watching until I couldn't. Life is too short for never-ending killing-all-main-characters soap operas!
2	3 body Problem is an interesting series.It does so many things right but a few clunky sc enes here and there.I have not read the books but I do see a very anti government / revolution tone to the first part, which Infeel does come across a little overtly blunt to the ideas of westernism.Other then that the highly suspenseful murder mystery along with emotional relationships make the series an interesting combination.Other reviews and comments keep suggesting that the characters are unrealistic as if scientists are cold and logical like spock from star trek.My experience with scientists and how they are expressed in this series is pretty spot on. Mix of intelligence with emotional investment.Overall I thought it let the audience clearly understand the issues at hand, whilst giving the hopelessness of their situation.The quality of the production is good in both picture and sound.Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy political science fictions with an alien twist.
1	The first few episodes really caught my attention but soon I felt that the later episodes were just stretched for no reason. Some of the later episodes were only filled with the characters just preventing each other from doing their tasks. I mostly skipped through those parts.The first few episodes were really interesting. Overall good could've been better. I guess there will be more to show in the next season. So eagerly waiting for that.I did find some of the expression of the actors to be repetitive, like predictable of some sort. That could've been better. 7 stars just for the first few episodes.
0	They took a show about doctors who are learning and having love interests and turned it into a political arena for left-wing extremism. Wasted potential in the later seasons. What a shame.
1	First few seasons were good, but slowly all good and interesting characters were killed off, now show is not bearable.
2	I have to admit when I saw this new series come up as a recommendation on Netflix, I was highly skeptical. I very much enjoyed the 1999 Jude Law and Matt Damon film based on Patricia Highsmith's novel. That film, although a departure from its original source, was well done and brilliantly acted; adding (I think) A more human and relatable element to the character of Tom Ripley. I did read Patricia Hysmith's original novel, and found Tom Ripley to be a very cold sociopath, as (I'm sure) she intended.I am happy to say my skepticism was put to rest.Ripley the miniseries is absolutely brilliant!! Much truer to its literary source than the film adaptation from 1999, Tom is colder, more calculating and a true sociopath. Yet somehow, the filmmaker still makes him the antihero of the story.Andrew Scott does here (I think) the best work of his career, the nuance of his character in every little facial gesture, movement of the eyes, calculating soliloquies... his work here is nothing less than brilliantMany here are commenting and praising the cinematography, and I completely agree. Filmed entirely in black-and-white, With a simplicity and starkness that allows the nuances of performance, as well as every shot to blaze through the screen and transport the viewer in an Immersive experience to 1960's Europe. Every scene, every shot, every edit is well thought out and pieced together and stripped down to allow the performances to shine and transport us through every frame.I did read the novel many years ago, and I would say this is a very true adaptation. Bravo to brilliant performances and direction and cinematography.
2	Whether you're a fan of the games, can't stand the games, or know absolutely nothing about the games- this show is a hit! Captivating, funny, doesn't hold back. The costumes, the sets, all of it is incredible. I am disappointed that the season is only 8 episodes long. By the end, I was debating picking up one of the games and playing it. I've disliked every Bethesda game I've ever played and would never have considered it had the show not been as good as it is. I wasn't necessarily a fan of the lead male character. His acting was great, but something was really missing there. WARNING: THE SHOW IS VIOLENT.
2	"Fallout does a great job capturing the unique tone that makes the games so great. An apocalyptic future suspended in time. That time being 1950's America. It's an ironic take on the Eisenhower period that takes the nuclear family a little too literally.It's entertaining to watch the contrast between humour and violence that resembles the Coen brothers' best work, whereby the humour is genuinely funny and the violence has real stakes.I was initially skeptical about this series. As a big fan of the games, it seemed like opportunistic studios just trying to capitalize on the ""video game to TV"" success of The Last of Us, but it's clear that between the big budget production, attention to detail and solid artistic choices (writing, acting and camera work all are exceptional), this is a passion project for Jonathon Nolan (brother of Christopher Nolan) and I think they've done a great job.Whether you're a fan of sci-fi, western, comedy, action/adventure, or just big, world building entertainment, this show has a bit of everything."
0	If you want a real show check out Southland.This show, especially by season 3, is woke BS. Cops do not focus on race as much as one episode does in season 3. Don't believe what they portray. This show dishonors, what is tries to represent as real, for all those who wear a shield.
1	"The show has a compelling pilot, and it's a fun watch at first. There's a bit of a slump in the middle of season one, but the season started and finished strong. I felt the writers really found their voice. They initially pair Nathan Fillion's character, John Nolan, with Lucy Chen. While an interesting pilot twist, the storyline lacked longevity, and the writers wisely move on to making the John-Talia interactions the center piece of the show.Then season two starts, and the Talia character is gone. I think this was a huge loss for Nathan Fillion's character - she was his counterbalance, and that's what made his car scenes compelling to watch. From then on, the show flounders on what to do with the titular character. They try to find a new character to pair him off with, but the magic is never recaptured. They try humanising him in a variety of ways, through his extremely bland son and his son's off-putting fiancée; his rich best friend who is almost always absent; the undercover cop turned cranky pregnant detective; his doctor girlfriend, and finally his firefighter girlfriend, who somehow also manages to be devastatingly bland despite being good at everything and having a sociopath husband.John Nolan becomes a more and more lighthearted character as the show goes on, but the jokes often fall flat and his charm runs thin, making him less relatable. It just doesn't click, I think because the character no longer has anyone anchoring him in reality.The most maintained and compelling character arc by far belongs to Tim, and how he navigates training Lucy. I think the writers realise this, because a lot of the episodes start revolving around them.Tim's unexpected approach to training rookie Katie Barnes (Katy O'Brian) was equally compelling, and also still centers around the rookie theme of the show, but the character leaves the show forever after one episode.John Nolan's character isn't the only character who gets saddled with uncompelling love interests - it's actually a hallmark of the show. I have no idea why the writers waste so much time giving everyone a bland wife or husband storyline. Angela Lopez and Wesley Evers are the most egregious example of this - the actors have zero chemistry, but the show forces it anyways. The fourth season especially is bogged down with silly side plotlines to give the Wesley character something to do. The writers then pull the exact same ""we work different parts of the justice system and act like enemies but we're actually attracted to one another"" storyline with Lucy Chen, and it's just as tedious the second time around.And then there's the very weird episode where they shoehorn in Niecy Nash's character as a rookie FBI agent and make her the main character for one day. I absolutely adore Niecy, but it felt like they were setting up a Rookie spin-off show with Niecy as the focus, only ?? Spin-off shows usually revolve around beloved existing characters in the show. Retconning Niecy's dad into the community center doesn't make her an existing character in this universe.The writing also becomes very heavy-handed in regards to intersectional issues like racism within the police force. I care about these issues and generally enjoy when they're explored in fiction, but by the third and fourth season the writing becomes so hamfisted that several scenes made me cringe.Overall, a show with a ton of potential, that's wasted because of directionless writing and way too much focus on pointless romance plotlines.I'm also worried why this show keeps losing main cast actors, especially Talia/Afton Williamson. She said it's because she experienced racism, and was harassed and assaulted on the show. By who? Is he still working on the show? Discovering why she left a really bad taste in my mouth, especially because the show pretends to champion human rights."
2	"The ""3 Body Problem"" series on Netflix, based on Liu Cixin's Hugo Award-winning novel, is a grand science fiction saga that weaves together stories from different timelines. It kicks off with the historical backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution, introducing us to Ye Wenjie, who, after witnessing her father's tragic death, ends up working at a secret SETI research station. In parallel, the series unfolds in the modern timeline, where a group of scientists grapples with unexplained phenomena and suicides among their ranks, hinting at a profound and unsettling mystery tied to an extraterrestrial message Ye Wenjie responds to, setting off a chain of events that spans decades.The show, brought to life by ""Game of Thrones"" creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, along with Alexander Woo, features a diverse and intriguing cast, including Eiza González, Benedict Wong, and Jovan Adepo, among others. It delves into themes of humanity, civilization, and the universe, exploring the complexities of contact with an alien civilization known as the Trisolarans. The narrative is rich with scientific concepts, existential threats, and philosophical dilemmas, providing a compelling watch for sci-fi enthusiasts.The reception of ""3 Body Problem"" has been generally favorable, with Rotten Tomatoes reporting a 77% approval rating and Metacritic giving it a score of 70, indicating generally favorable reviews. The series has sparked discussions and debates among viewers, particularly for its ambitious storytelling and handling of the intricate plot of the source material."
0	"I have not read the novel and I dived in the show with no preconceptions. Well, I was disappointed quite rapidly as the some of the elements of the story killed the interest I had for the show.So the Chinese had their own SETI project, that's fine. Then we see that Ye Wenjie makes contact with an alien being. I will pass on the fact that being able to decode a alien signal and translate it into a human language is done in a very short time (hours? Mins?). That was my first hic.Vera Ye's death is mysterious and her mother tells Jin that Vera did a very unusual thing before her death which was playing a VR game using a wireless helmet. Jin and Jack supposedly highly educated and smart people act, surprisingly, in the dumbest possible way. Instead trying to find out the origins of the helmet and its technology they are oblivious to all the warning they use it! Auggie tells them ""We don't have this technology"", ""that thing is hacking into your brain"" and THEY KEEP PLAYING WITH DAMN HELMET? Seriously! Now the sequence where Auggie uses the helmet for the first time in Episode 3 is supposed to convince us that the characters act in a sane and rational way. Well they do, except Jin and Jack but let's say the helmet may have turned them into addicts of the game. The others however, just let it go and leave the helmet with Jin and jack instead to studying as it seems to be one of the key elements of the puzzle.All those scientist mysteriouly dying or murdered aroung the world and only one guy is investigating the case? When you think that somebody is making the sky blink using morse code you put all the ressources you have on it!The show clumsily tries to get our attention on the game and its mysteries then on the Aliens. But It's hard to go past the ridiculous parts of the plot.To finish the idea of making the sky blink (they say universe in the show which is laughable). Does not make any sense for so many reasons that it would be too long to explain here. Let's just say that the stars we see are just a tiny portion of what our Galaxy. At least we know that the sky did not actually blink but they just point it out and do absolutely nothing about it."
1	"The sound balance is off. It is too difficult to hear character dialog over the rock music playing in the ""background"" during intense scenes."
0	"The build up of the white walkers is tantalising. The wait we all went through to get to the final show down was like hot coals under our feet. All the merchandise stated ""WINTER IS COMING"". But as the series progressed, the writing started to fall. Sure, there were some pretty stupid Hollywood plots, however all was forgiven because it was leading somewhere. Now, it was all for nothing. The biggest adversary in TV history turns out to have absolutely no other purpose than finning out the northern army. And the death of the night king was lazy, pathetic and just sums up D&D's writing ability. I really enjoyed the ride, it made me read the books and history of ASOIAF, but the outcome does an absolute disservice to the entire fiction. It's such a shame. #JustICEforthenightking"
0	"There is so much in this story that could have been so very cool and interesting and so fresh to watch. But it completely falls flat in dialogue and attempting to push characters that are comically too cool for school while being pretty, oh and they are cosmologists and physicists and whatever else at the same time. It's just silly. I would laugh and finally found myself just skipping almost any scene with the Auggie character by the end, because it didn't matter to the plot usually and the actress just was not right for this role and couldn't hold up to it. Terrible casting and writing for her character overall.Eventually I realized you can largely just play the scenes with the Chinese actors and get the actual plot and move the story along and anything else is fluff. Pure fluff that involves people saying ""what's going on?"" Seven times or ""I didn't ask for this!"". I mean the level of selfishness even after these people know an entire alien population is coming to take over the world was truly western. It made me cringe for my culture. Just people whining or talking about nonsense until we cut back to the Chinese characters and finally things move along. I was pulling my friggin hair out by the right episode. Not all westerners are like this and especially not scientists. Who wrote this?Anyway, I think the book is very good and far more interesting that this confused and poorly written mess. Enough with the brooding and petulance at a big unfair world, could I please have characters that act like adults? People who step up when called on and not ones that recede to a childlike state of petulance while gasping ""what's going on!""."
0	"In the beginning, this was an interesting medical drama that focused on a few first-year interns whose lives were intertwined. Interesting concept and initially was more focused on medical procedures with excellent writing and actors. Now, it's just a bunch of crappy, woke BS, with some medical drama interwoven in it. Since the ever-departing good actors (Justin Chambers, Patrick Dempsy, Jessica Capshaw, Sandra Oh, Eric Dane, Kate Walsh) have left, the ones that are left have crappy writing and little character development.Ellen Pompeo is a good actress, she has carried this show into the further seasons, but she's very much alone. The rest of the cast may be better actors than what the writing is allowing for them (Chandra Wilson, James Pickens Jr, Kevin Mckidd, Kim Raver) but that's about where it ends. The rest are like background or uninteresting characters that got moved to the forefront with the departures of the better actors.I wouldn't mind there being a character that calls out the other characters for their unprofessionalism in the workplace. The medical procedures and drama are masked with stupid, vapid arguments between characters who are either sleeping with each other (in the hospital at times,) or launching into some monologue about what things they're going through. While this (monologue) was cute for the Grey character to do, when others do it too, it makes it not as cute, it makes it annoying and immature. These are supposed to be smart grown-ups who make life and death decisions on the daily and they're being petty with each other, cheating on each other and bringing almost no redeeming qualities to the table.Now with the latest cast of characters, they have some brooding dude that's related to Amelia, a smart black woman who could be written so much better than she currently is, the actor, (Alexis Floyd) has the chops to carry this show if only the writing and her character development didn't suck. I don't care for most of the other characters, I can't stand the Amelia character, another whose acting chops could do more if given better material. Jo, Maggie, Levi, Link, Winston, Kwan, Jules, Mika, even Scott Speedman's character is just meh. I keep watching I guess because I want the characters to be better. I keep hoping that the writing will move from woke BS so something with weight, that the characters will be redeeming and the medical drama will unfold and be the focus, not juvenile inter-relationship crap.Don't get me wrong about the woke comment, I think this show has been a pretty good platform for social injustices and bringing to the forefront things like outdated blood donation policies, family decisions during a trying time, and the plight of black women in positions of leadership in the workplace. The writing now is just so ""end of the road,"" for a series, like they aren't even trying anymore. Bring in better writers and get rid of the weaker characters and this show may have a better chance at recapturing me.With the writer's strike, this may be a good time just to put this one out of its misery."
1	The show is a classic hollywood type show that is fun to watch once in a while but I was a bit dissapointed with season 3 and feel lieks it's going downhill like most tv shows after a couple of seasons.
1	"Having watched the whole of season 1 will I be eagerly awaiting season 2? Probably not. Acting is above average and effects are good but the story hasn't grabbed me and the logic and ""science"" behind the storyline is somewhat flawed.For example how are 300 nuclear devices suspended in space in a stable line awaiting detonation and since the detonations appear to do close how does the first not knock the latter ones out of position. Also with the heatsets provided by the aliens, where are they made since the technology is hundreds of years in advance of earth's. If they are made by the aliens how did they travel 4000 lights years from the alien planet in the 50 odd years since first contact?"
0	The first several seasons of the show were stellar. They didn't follow the books to the letter, but that's to be expected. They showed most of the glorious twists and turns of the books in a glorious way and they made fantasy mainstream again.However, midway through, the writing started to falter. Cracks in the minds behind the screen started to become apparent. And in seasons 7 & 8, everything went downhill. Story lines were left hanging, main characters were ignored, important twists and plot-points were replaced with cheap jump-scares and obvious pseudo-twists. The moment D&D went off the books, their inability to write even a basic story-line became apparent...At this point I'd recommend the TV show to people only for the cultural value of knowing how bad it can get... I honestly believe that 50 years from now this show will be studied in college (if those still exist) as an example of bad TV writing... I only hope that George R. R. Martin manages to finish the books so that we finally get the end we've been waiting for...
1	"As a computer scientist with a solid understanding of physics, I didn't find a single scientific explanation that made sense. The arguments are often centered around the notion that ""Science is broken"" or that ""the Universe is ignoring the laws of physics"" while the characters that are supposed to be highly talented Oxford students lose all scientific rigor simply because they are scientists and are expected to be skeptical and atheist by nature, leading them to deny everything like if they were very afraid to start thinking maybe god exists. At times, it seemed like a parody of skepticism and atheism from an overly dumb perspective.While I found it entertaining, I couldn't help but be put off by their depiction of a parallel world where all scientists are portrayed as idiots and the existence of god is their biggest fear."
1	"Full Disclosure: I have NOT played the game. I find dystopian-future-based storyline games boring. I'll admit that maybe I'm missing something, but repeatedly killing/maiming zombies/vampires/mutants/gov't agents ad nauseum just doesn't raise my dopamine levels.Having said that, I am 3 episodes into watching this show.I like the story thus far, and I am amazed at the sets (the detail, the size and the ingenuity that has gone into their creation). I find that the character development is also keeping me interested so far. And the dialog, characters, directing and editing are all good, IMO. I really enjoy the ""cameos"" of actors I like that have frequently popped up so far as well.The main 3 things that subtract from the the show to me are these - 1) it's pretty easy for me to figger out what's going to happen next (so far) - yawn...; 2) the lead character/heroine(?), while very well cast, scripted and acted, has something about her personality that makes me want to ram my fist into the screen and smack the 'holy skeet' out of her; and 3) the soundtrack of the 60's Country and Western tunes pushes me to my limits of endurance. Granted, that may be because my Dad constantly listened to this music when I was a kid; but I feel it is mostly because I only like this kind of music when I am really drunk and going thru a some kind of 'betrayal' in my life. It's definitely NOT a music genre I want to hear when I DON'T feel that way!So, to summarize, I am slogging my way thru this show. TBH, I hope it keeps me entertained well enough to put up with its detractions!"
0	No more to say than what everyone already knows. The last season, particular the last 3 episodes were an absolute embarrassment. Dan and Dave should never show their faces again. They have ruined what was looking to be an unbeatable TV show. But no. Words can't sum up how disgusted I am by the last season. Pathetic. Truly pathetic. The cinematography and acting was unbelievably good as ever of course, but the writing was that of a parody. I laughed throughout at the ridiculousness and moronisism of the writing. This doesn't even come close to how annoyed and nauseated by the deplorable attempt at writing this last season. D&D have spat in the faces of the actors, crew, fans, GRRM and the reputation and memory of the show. They should be ashamed of themselves, but I'm sure they're looking forward to scuttling off for the Star Wars money. I am angry beyond comprehension and can't begin to imagine how the actors who spent 10 years on this show feel to have this rushed collosal mess as their end to years of work. I am sick to my stomach that these men can call themselves writers. They are incompetent, imbecilic dunces. I will never watch this again. Ever.
0	"Absolutely not.It is not only made unbearable adapt,as an original drama it was notlogical and scientific at all. If the sparkling of universe can be seen by eyes without any auxiliary means,how the world still in peace? And when the three suns turned into stars in the game,is the unexpected snowstorm reasonable? Seems that the temperature decline would be too quick.By the way,the actors and actresses also brought bad performances. Their actions were lifeless,and what they said were just like reading the script after the shoot,without any emotion in it.I have no idea where Netflix use the money. When the nanometer materials passed through the ship,it seemed like the ship was made by papers,have no texture. What I can say was that this part was worse than Chinese cartoon 3body problem made by a company named ""YHKT ENTERTAINMENT"".What are they doing?"
0	"Fallout as a game has always had amazing lore and game design and being the person I tend to just naturally check reviews before watching a show to see consistent 5 stars and 97% rotten tomatoes. Is this a joke? Perhaps a collective prank just like morbius I honestly don't know.*spoilers from episode 1 and 2 below*The acting is awful but not just awful but the script these actors have to read from don't even help. Quite literally the worse dialogue I've had to listen too. I understand the concept that vault dwellers are naive but there is being naive and then being quite literally stupid with the huge lack of any survival instinct to the point where maybe the little genetic diversity due to them being all cousins has canonically made them all cognitively impaired. Lucy's ignorance is unbearable: giving her only water bottle to a complete stranger on the surface who looks like he would rob her for everything? This is way past her being simply naive, she's just an idiot. The dialogue between her and the ghoul was so cringeworthy I was ready to turn off the show right then, as I realised that maybe Lucy's stupidity may not be satirical.Going back to episode 1 when the raiders were killing the people of vault 33 with the exception of a few 33 vault dwellers putting in some effort to stopping them, majority did absolutely nothing. Not only was there no sense of urgency and lack of security (I mean as they were all fighting, two people were still carrying food on a tray casually oblivious to the shooting of guns and the screaming? Something that was heard even from Lucy all the way in her room with the door locked).Maximus....honestly it's like the show wants me to hate these characters how can someone with even little screen time be so annoying. The scene between him and the cult leader during his interrogation was once again a hard watch. He's not even interesting , he's not likeable, he's probably cried more than he's spoken and he's a terrible knight. Talking about the knights (the guys in the power armour) they are obviously shown to be these intimidating/strong and trusted fighters for the brother of steel yet when one of them comes in contact with a mutated bear resorted to the ""act dead"" approach and had to rely on his squire with just a pistol to take it down for him. Pay in mind this is the same knight who was saying ""I just what to shoot something right now"" and dropping off the helicopter early just to be a complete embarrassment. What's more stupid is that as Maximus was going to stim him so he didn't die the knight in the power amour saw this as an opportunity to absolute incinerate maximus for no reason despite maximus being the one to decide his survival and the one who saved him in the first place. I thought these guys underwent vigorous training and even some education yet the chosen knights all share a singular brain cell apparently.This show is awful. The acting is awful. Dialogue is awful. I really don't care about Lucy or Maximus to be honest they are both equally unlikeable and I really don't understand how the reviews on this show are high considering the terribly non-engaging plot and awful creation of 2D characters.Don't watch it it's not worth your time."
1	I originally had this amazing series 10/10 but downgraded it to 6/10 purely on season 8.Up until season 8 it was gripping with the great war looming and the throne contenders lining up. All seemed to be going great until the end of episode 3. The night king meets his demise and sets the final episodes up for the last war. What did it bring us? Bewilderment!Rhaegal the dragon taken down by one Scorpion arrow yet Drogon flies through an entire fleet and fortress equipped with an arsenal of scorpions.Two of the main characters Cersie and Jamie flattened by rubble, what a let down to see these two beneath bricks when they have been arguably two of the best characters in the entire show.No Cersie Sansa face off which everyone was expecting and a prophecy that tells John he is the rightful king which leads to him taking the life of Danerys only to end his character back where he started being a nothing north of the wall while Bran, who's done virtually nothing for 8 seasons, given the crown!???How could they possibly have got this so so wrong?
1	I started watching this a few months ago and thoroughly enjoy it. I have just started season 5 and I can already feel it going downhill as some characters just get super annoying. The worst is Meredith and Derek with their issues. Meredith behaves badly towards Lexie all the time and only cares about her stupid relationship with Derek- which has been the same thing for the last 4 seasons where they constantly breakup and make up... Derek is arrogant and cant stick to one woman and he keeps blaming Meredith for everything wrong with their relationship when he was wrong in more than one way as well.Dr Hahn is annoying, the way she treated Yang was wrong and even though she was reprimanded regarding this, it was still painful to watch. Lexie annoys me too because she thinks she knows everything and when she read the others files and stole from the hospital it made me dislike her character even more.I like the other characters and their growth, Addison by far improves the most and is actually a really nice person when she gets back from LA.The show is good, the medical miracles are unbelievable and there's a lot to learn but I feel they start dragging eventually and the plot eventually becomes nonsensical.
2	I told my niece who's also watching the show, it's slow but still great. It took me back to House of Cards, where every moment is tense, important, and a masterclass of acting and directing. FX continues to prove they are not just the home of movies but excellent tv. Shogun provides a true experience to old Japan and it's culture; the sets are beautiful, the cast is intentional with every word and movement, the director provides a depth and understanding to each characters feelings and thoughts yet can still leave one guessing. The old culture shows us that everything we do is meaningful and how much weight a single word or stare actually means. Also, I'm a sucker for flashbacks and when they are used correctly it brings so much more depth to characters and situations. This show allows us to watch as if we were listening to an audio book, and they are illustrating what's happening as we listen. I would like more action as the true action Stan I am but they provide realism to how battles occur, they take time and planning.
1	The tv show is one of the best series ever made but as time went by they rushed to finish it as fast as they can and ruined a lot of characters along the way. Shame that the fans are so disrespected after years of tremendeous support. It was a 9/10 for me before the last season and many would give it less than my 6/10 after this season but I think it is still worth a watch.
1	I was bored for the first three episodes. Kind of like the game, the lameness of vault life and the initial leaving of the vault is slow. The story did a good job of building up the mystery of the vault experiments. I loved the ghoul character (props to Walton Gibbens). They did a really good job of sticking to the source materials (the games). I almost felt like I was playing the next fallout game while watching. The lead did an amazing job of being both the naive vault dweller and a capable survivor. My only advice to the team is to speed up things a bit. I am looking forward to the next season!
1	"What they did was using a B&W version of a classic story well filmed with the best cast possible is not compelling enough to surpass the Talented Mr Ripley. All three characters just falls short to present a engaging game of manipulation, deceit and intense thriller which is the underlying foundation of the story.With the aforementioned story filmed in Positano which demonstrated the allure and beauty of an Italian town was perfecto for the original story. Then they tried to shoot Ripley in Atrani with an equally quaint setting but fails to capture the story using B&W only. I struggled to find this captivating in the first three episodes. You can try shoot the blue of ocean as hard as you like but you'll never capture the azzura of the blue Italian coast using black & white. You can clearly see the difference when equally shown how it was done with The Eqauliser with Denzel Washington and Fanning shot in almost exactly the same location but in colour. Even the white of the settings aren't as well done.However from episode 4 it starts to make sense when city shots in Rome and the various architecture in the big cities presented the dramatic story and the darkness of Tom Ripley. But it still didn't come across as convincing as the Matt Damon. The three just didn't gel for me in Ripley.Italian cast and cinematography in big cities were excellent in most scenes. I really just wanted to see the ending by this point and hoped it was just a ""who done it"" crime story but no, they leave you hanging a bit for perhaps season 2."
1	I like Nathan Fillion. Everybody likes Nathan Fillion. He was the star of the legendary tv show, Firefly and the movie it spawned, Serenity. Great stuff.But this show is lame and filled with cliches. None of these actors are believable cops. And I can see that the shills are out and handing out 10's like they're going out of style. lolThe police procedural all police procedurals need to be measured against is Southland. And this one is not even close.
1	I'm only two episodes in so bear with me, but the thing I've noticed so much is the smoking. There seems so much of it at a time where in the UK less than 20% of the population smokes, much lower the younger you are, and definitely not in any type of workplace. It makes London feel quite Sandmanish. Apart from that I agree that the main character seems unable to express real emotions other than a uniform aggrieved look. I will continue to watch as I have been drawn in a bit, the video game does seem an interesting addition to the plot, and clearly a winking universe has some value, but I'm still going to guess that the average cigarette lighting per episode will continue at a mark of four plus.
0	"It's missing all of the mistery, intrigue and thrill of the books. The characters, if they aren't removed they have different personalities and roles that are just worse. Here we have a group of ""academics"" that act more like teens from stranger things and dress like NY models and are all basic arquetypes. The sarcastic one, the reluctant hero, the clown, the sensitive one, the cynic... Really, you could take these characters and throw them in Stranger Things, or bring those here and they would fill each other's roles perfectly. It would be better with those characters here. At least the stranger things characters are deeper. In this show none of the characters have actual development.The pacing is just bad, there is no buildup for anything so the reveals all fall flat. It feels like if the creators thought that everyone had already read the books so there was no need for mistery or intrigue. The story seems to be on a rush, but they certainly have time for bad melodrama, gotcha moments and unfunny ""funny"" scenes. The science is butchered, simplified, instead of showing theories creatively they literally have people do exposition like a professor at physics 101.Of course Netflix did The Three-Body Problem lite for teens, that's their target audience. What a disappointment. At least this show led me to discover the chinese adaptation, which is miles better and has respect for the source material, not just its characters, but its ideas and atmosphere."
2	Having not read the book prior to watching this is probably an advantage. While it retains many of the cultural revolution parts, the main bits are in the UK. Purists may not like this but I think for western viewers it makes sense.It is really well shot, the moral and scientific conundrums are good and while Westernised it doesn't have the usual Western tropes of good guys and bad guys, everyone is a bit of each and each has it's own perspective and rationality.The story goes along at a good pace, and most of the characters are interesting and well acted. The only one so far I have little interest in is Saul.What helps is both the pacing but also some unexpected turns, well unexpected for me.It is definitely more cerebral than most sci-fi these days, and as much as I liked the peripheral, this is a lot better.So I am sure purists won't like some of the transition to the wrst, Incel scifi nerds will do their head in at the multicultural/diverse cast and your average viewer will probably struggle with the fact you have to think and the fact no one is clean skin, it is definitely one of the best new shows of 2024.Hell it has even got me to buy the books, though I will read after watching, so as not to ruin both with preconceptions.
2	Having read the original book, and remembering the original TV miniseries, this has so far done a really credible job. Location are great stand ins, actors are doing an incredible job. It does not move overly fast and not to many confusing flash backs. However, just a few things keep it from the 10, I would love to get it. Unlike the original series the show is dark, not as bright in coloring if that makes sense. The other problem is the subtitles. While the teen in movies is to use native language with subtitle, having to read the almost all the time, distracts from being able to sit back and enjoy the film itself. If you lie having to read your shows, it's perfect.
1	It's been said before but Game of Thrones is Outstanding... That is for the first four series and part of the fifth.If you have not seen this series ever, a quick word of warning! Unless you enjoy watching programs that are so powerfully portrayed that they become a passion only to then have it all torn away in a rushed and totally disappointing series finale then Game of Thrones is the series for you.I honestly could not enjoy the first five series anymore, I was truly passionate about it and devoted weeks to the program, I read the books and purchased the merchandise and now I wish I hadn't of bothered.The worst is that the characters that I had spent eight years getting to know became caricatures of themselves.The cast is fantastic, it's truly acted well, the production was fantastic if a little poor with its use of CGI towards the final series but unfortunately this is a series that was plagued with poor writers (D&D) that seem that they could not escape fast enough.Series eight is abismal. Anyone who hasn't seen it I would warn away, if you need to then act as if series 5 was the finale, otherwise the outcome will just make you angry
0	"I was absolutely horrified when I saw Ellen being interviewed in a candid moment after the season 2 finale aired. When asked about the very hot scene she had with Patrick Dempsey she said ""he is like a brother to me. I just wanted the kiss and the scene to be over with as quickly as possible."" I cannot believe her unprofessional thoughtlessness in saying those words. Doesn't she know that her romance with Mcdreamy is a huge draw for the show? How could she ruin that fantasy for all the viewers? Now, I cannot think of any scene between them as real. So I hope their tryst ends once and for all this third season. I sincerely hope the network has strong words with her for her careless comments. In fact, I wish I had never seen that interview and or that her comments were cut. For me, it has ruined her credibility as an actress. I expected better of her. I am extremely disappointed in her as a star."
0	A piece of garbage. Four episodes featuring improbable video games made with a $30 graphics engine, personal telenovelas, and the official declaration that the new enemy to denigrate is the Chinese. Episodes 5 and 6 are not bad, but then it falls into oblivion. Stereotyped characters, clichéd lines, questionable acting, and clichés everywhere. The good, the bad, the ugly, the professional.The story itself could be interesting, with some novel aspects, but the format is indecent. Entire episodes focus on the characters' family affairs, reminiscent of Friends. If you don't have the budget, don't attempt science fiction. Eight hours wasted, with only three or four interesting moments. Too few for seven hours.BTW a lot of smoking people. Young smoking peopole, not only the bad guy...
1	"What in gosh name's is wrong with the lead actor?First af all, they did him dirty when they put those blue contacts in his brown eyes. First thing I noticed in the first episode... Second of all, he only has ONE expression in this whole series. Sad face , sad puppy eyes, poor little boy who has just been scolded by his mommy... Really no other expression, love, dissappointment , anger, confusion.. nothing!And when he ""tries"" to show a different emotion, he justs screams and yells differently.And to finish my dissappointment... what's up with the grunting ""grrr"" , are we watching an anime?If they would have chosen someone with more life in their face maybe I would have another opinion but he just ruins the whole series."
1	"The series is pretty good, and I like some of the characters a lot (Nathan Fillion is great) but the problem I have with most of it is they bend over backwards to make the male characters kinda okay but ALL of the female characters are badass, perfect, and right all the time. They pretty much all come off like the same character. There's one who is a little different, but she's still somehow magical in all things.New girl who isn't a cop? Don't worry, she's probably a navy seal, mathematics genius, artistic savant.It's actively distracting from the quality of the show. Realistically dialing back the preaching and social commentary and the show would rocket up to 8-9.Here's an example which isn't really too spoilery: Guy gets shot, woman has baby, they check with one another and he says something innocuous and she says ""The correct response is that childbirth wrecks havoc on a woman's body and is very traumatic"" Then the scene basically ends. There's no point to that kind of commentary other than to point out that women can be badass and have it all and need to correct men at all costs. I can't actually recall a SINGLE time where a man and a woman disagreed and the man was right (according to the writers)Then you have well rounded characters who grow with the show and some interesting plot lines which aren't all just recycled from other shows. I keep remembering how much I like the show, then a new season comes out and it's somehow even MORE preachy than the last one and I slog through it for the good parts."
2	"I am a massive fan of the game. And have gone through New Vegas more times than I should admit. But, the embodiment and spirit is alive and well through the eyes of Lucy McLean (Ella Purnell) a vault dweller who hasn't had to experience real adversity in life.If you've seen ""Blast From The Past"" (1999) a lot of this will be familiar. Though not as dark, it took the simple sweet naive character of Brendan Fraser and put him in real world Los Angeles. Same here. Except MUCH darker.The humor is dark as well. What director Jonathan Nolan did so well is to incorporate a sense of futility in the lives, similar to game play.The lighting and camera work are spot on to the game. You can tell they REALLY studied it. A lot of places, if you've played the game, will seem very familiar. But also, it's just different enough where you don't roll your eyes thinking it's all fan service. He integrates small things like Cram and Nuka Cola with such ease, it's almost like the meme where Leo DiCaprio keeps pointing at the screen to get your attention.The eye popping primary colors of the 50's/60's era is in full swing. If you can't tell the difference between film and digital, this puts your eyes to ease. Clearly this was a film shot movie. Glossy in texture, they lean into the fringe edges.Not that any viewer would intellectually care, but you really feel the Wasteland.Again, if you played the game, you know how many worlds they can explore here.' Actress Ella Purnell plays the wide-eyed vault child perfectly. She's sweet and wholesome in a newly brutal world. Similar to Sandra Bullock's portrayal of Leona Huxley in ""Demolition Man"" Though not necessarily excited for a bygone era.The characters she encounters only beefs up the idea of how over her head she's gotten herself into.The setup does feel a little rush. It begins with just absolute brutality. Yes, this is introduced. But, it really plays like the game. Where violence is dismissed quickly. If you haven't played, it's going to be a little off-putting. But it does make sense. It took me off guard for a moment. The idea is to get that open world feel and this series does it perfectly.This is one of the video game series I am absolutely excited to see continue. There is SO much to mine and I'm ready for it.Well done all!"
1	The show was complex and hard to watch. Just as a fellow human you don't want anyone to go through mental illness. Personally I also hate the amount of abuse suffered by the main character as well. Why though he does he just keep making bad choice after bad choice? A lot of it blamed on his want of something more and what he was willing to endure to get it but I'm not sure I buy it. It feels like something else is just under his surface. Maybe in time he will reveal more of his story. I do applaud his keeping his stalker's identity a secret and allow her to try and get the help she so desperately needs. I would be curious to know more of her back story and why she became so obsessed with other people. The first 4 episodes were, for me, the best of the series.
1	"I'm actually being generous giving it 5 starsWell that's 8 hours of my life I won't get back and whist I appreciate that it's a dark storyline, does it have to be drab and boring also?Italy itself is a central character in the plot of ""Ripley"" and like the miscasting of every single other character, the director has actually made Italy look about as glamorous as Grimsby (no offence Grimsby).Who was the casting director? Have they actually read the book?Ripley himself is meant to have charm, the quality of a good conman, sadly he has none. It's totally unbelievable that Dickie would invite this man to lunch, never mind stay with him. Whilst I loved Andrew Scott's character in Fleabag, so he's clearly a good actor but totally wrong for this part.The fridge in Dickie's apartment has more charisma than either Dickie himself or Marge and don't get me started on Freddie. I can't say whether it was bad casting, scriptwriting, acting or directing, but it was just wrong. Do we really have so few talented actors with abit of swagger to pull ""Freddie"" off?Now, I'm sure some other reviewers will claim to be cinephiles and wax lyrical about the ""dark symbolism"" of the series, but surely the point of a series is to entertain and this didn't.I wanted to like it I really did, but sadly the cast was completely wrong, the script boring and cinematography a crime."
1	Just finished watching final of 3 body problem. Bit of a crap cliff hanger ending. And how annoying was that young Latino actress who played the nano tech scientist. The worst actress I've seen in years. All she did was pout her lips and look like a bored plank of wood. She must have been sleeping with the director to get that part. Maybe spend more of the budget on better actors, than on expensive locations and cgi.Some of the cast seemed too young for the roles and weren't totally believable. The cgi was good though and the seasoned British cast's characters were likeable and believable.Otherwise it held my attention and hopefully season 2 will improve.
2	"I was not familiar with this going into it, so I had zero expectations.After watching all 8 episodes, I can say that I felt it was well done and extremely enjoyable.It a nice fresh breath into the world of Sci-Fi, where science and psychology co-mingle.Who are the bad guys? Do they really exist? Is it all a ""scam""? Are we playing into their hands?The ""humans being humanities best ally and worst enemy"" is quite on target as well.It is nice to have to actually think about motives, players, actions, and ""hints"" dropped along the way. Also, it's nice to think about these creatures in a non-humanoid way and really stretch the mind of what they could be. Bi-pedal humanoids is so last decade...Do the aliens exist? Can they not lie? Do they shrivel in the face of heat but can be animated, do they freeze and break?"" The ""if one of us survives we all do"" seems so very prophetic.I like to guess that relates to them being some sort of bacteria or hive minded virus that has great technology and likes to ""deep fake"" us.Regardless, it's been a wonderful ride and I hope it keeps going that way."
2	This is the 6th reiteration of the absorbing fictional story of Tom Ripley. Of the 5 earlier versions, I was able to watch The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) starring Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow.This film is a series which gives it ample time to explore the complicated character that is Tom Ripley. And Andrew Scott totally inhabits his role as Ripley, a really talented conman. Scott delivers the goods, so to speak.It's a mesmerizing crime thriller helped a lot by its beautiful locales: from Atrani in the Amalfi Coast, to Rome, Palermo and Venice.It's also interesting, casting-wise, that John Malcovich, who started in Ripley's Game (2002) plays a cameo role as Reeves Minot, a questionable art dealer and forger.Dakota Fanning and Johnny Flynn play crucial supporting roles, not to mention the Italian detective Mauricio Lombardi who's effective in his role as the determined Pietro Ravini.This is an excellent movie which is binge-worthy on a particularly hot weekend.
1	I was a big fan of Game of Thrones ever since it first aired on HBO. However, after waiting for two years, I (as probably also a lot of others) felt that the season didn't rise up the rest of the show. I believe the writers and producers didn't do the show justice and rushed the story. In these 6 episodes and pretty much destroyed most of the major character lines. It took 7 seasons for these complex story lines to evolve, just to be shattered in 2 episodes. That being said, taking in consideration that season 8 is a part of GOT, I don't believe anymore that the show deserves the 9.5 stars.
2	This masterpiece of a series is completely unique from the movie, and really elicits its own distinctive film noir vibe both in cinematography and dialogue. Purposeful yet subtle performances by all involved; Andrew Scott is absolutely perfect for this role.I haven't seen a TV series interpreted from a film source this well since Hannibal, where Mads Mikkelsen was also perfectly cast and gave an unforgettable performance.What else can be said about this series? A bit of a slow burn, but the pacing is completely suitable, and allows for a bit more fleshing out and development of the characters. Although I love the vibrant colors along the coast of Italy as much as anyone, I feel the choice to use a monochromatic palette here really enhanced the mood and atmosphere of the story.Top notch production in all aspects!
2	I used to like this series...alot. But all good things must come to an end. Season 17 is really, really bad. We are so tired of being manipulated by the media, we sure don't need it from television series. Put this show and it's viewers out of the painful misery of continuing, please!
1	I love this show but I have to be honest, the quality has been dipping since the start of series 4. Afton Williamson, who played Officer Bishop, left suddenly before season 2 aired and she was written off on that seasons first episode. At the start of season 4, Titus Makin Jr who played Officer Jackson suddenly left and so his character was killed off with an extra standing in. That's two black actors who left without fully explaining why. It's very worrying.The show itself is fantastic but the quality is dropping during season 4. It feels like it's been made by a totally new team and the exceptional actors are suffering. Bad storylines and annoying side characters (The annoyingly perfect Simone Clark because she was a Guidance Councillor).The first three seasons are amazing. I hope season 5 saves it.
2	Have played the games since #1 and I think it hits the right tone and aesthetic. The games have shifted and evolved with time, but I'm surprised at how many other commentators claim the series isn't dark enough or too funny. All the Fallouts were weird *especially* the original isometric ones (1 and 2). The Brotherhood of Steel, the vault dwellers, raiders, and quirky side characters are all true to the games. The over the top gonzo violence and the retrofuture dystopia are also straight from the game. The series song choices of 50s crooners set to a new context also is true to the game. The weird macguffin story setting the vault dwelling protagonist out on a quest to the surface (a quest she really doesn't understand the context for) is also totally fallout.So it works. This is fallout. They nailed the vibe spot on and the story and characters are well cast.
2	"Everything I truly like about this show except the""Lucy Chen"" character. She is soooo very annoying and pushy towards everybody. Does she have to be in so many scenes!? It's not nirmal for a policewoman be sooo talkative, who pushes her agenda on the guy she has a super crush on. It's annoying. Everything thing else, storylines, other characters, the acting, the actiin is so very good. Thank goodness for fast forward so I can get past the long chattering ""Lucy Chen""."
1	I use to enjoy this , fast paced with plenty of story, but season 2 episode was too much, when they saved the guy in the concrete and the dad killed his self , way too much cheese.
1	I am constantly let things go on this version of a police drama. Some of the things on this police show is quite a stretch for police work. However letting a FBI trainee be involved in a tracking down terrorist then her an her trainer (the show producer)express their sexual preferences is a bit much. Of course she being a black woman she has to be a single mother with a father who drives a Cadillac.
0	What's good about a show if it's climax is the worst thing you have ever seen.
2	It's no secret that the show has maybe dropped in recent seasons however, I think a big reason for this is because a lot of the original cast were gone after S11. People grew an attachment to these actors and the characters they portrayed but I still believe that the show is very good and has become very in touch with real life problems!The actual show itself is incredible right after episode 1 you realise how good a show Shonda has created and she still continues to do so. So emotional you will laugh, cry and be pissed but you will fall in love with it, no doubt.The show hasn't yet deterred me away and I have stayed interested enough to rewatch it several times. I think people need to persevere with it after S11/12 and see how they fair with new character introductions and developments, but if you made it that far, push on till the end.
0	It is boring and the episodes is copy of other series. It's dissapointing to see a how good it had began in the first season and how boring it went in the second season.I did like the effects and the settings. The actors do a good job, but the writers are uncreative and waste the talent of the actors.So kurzgesagt: The main story is an interessting idea but the stories for the episodes are just copied from other serieses. A lot of convenience plotpoints and a lot of dumb decisions of the character. You can basically watch, how the characters do stuff to help the plot 🙄 The actors, the effects and settings are good.
1	Maybe just watch it up to season 6 then think of how you'd like the series to end. Would be more enjoyable if they didn't do such a terrible job ending the series.
1	Not really sure why this show get a rating of 8 here on IMDB.The show is pretty entertaining but most of the characters are really unlikeable. Arrogant and annoying.Angela constantly feels the need to show off her position of power by behaving extremely arrogant towards her ''boot''.Jackson starts off the first episode making sure his superiors know from the beginning his dad fills an important function in the hopes of creating some kind of advantage.Tim is a downright annoying bully who abuses his position as a police officer and trainer.In one of the first episodes he degrades and cusses out a bunch of immigrants in front of his ''boot''.He involves his ''boot'' into personal problems and in a moment of anger he decides to provoke a bunch of bikers so they'll give him a reason to punch a few of then so he can get rid of his anger, once again, in front of his ''boot''. Absolutely toxic, which only makes his arrogance more misplaced.Such a shame that Rookie Blue (a similar tv show with way more likeable characters) got cancelled, only to get replaced with a show like this.This show reminds of me How To Get Away With Murder; an ok (but cliche) show but too much annoying characters to fully enjoy it. Shame.
1	"On its own merits this is a decent show. We'll developed world, well developed characters, truly excellent production values and good actors. Where it majorly falls down is in being a Fallout show.Transitioning anything from an interactive to a passive medium never really works, but this only has the veneer of the fallout universe. It ignores all the lore, and everything that would make it more ""fallouty"". Ghouls don't sound like ghouls, established lore is ignored or contradicted and nothing is added to justify it.If this was a totally new franchise it would be a solid 8 out of 10. The associations to fallout drag it down significantly, as the tv and the games can't be judged independently. When the TV claims to steer so close to the source material its total disregard for it needs to be factored in.Watch it if you've never played the games, and watch it if you have but just pretend it's not fallout."
0	I get it. Covid happened. And it's still happening. For my own sanity I have now limited my exposure to the news and only follow what's necessary to stay up to date. I turn the TV on to switch off from the horror of the past year. I was really looking forward to the next season of Greys. Watched from the very beginning.Congratulations. You made me relive a real life horror that's not even finished yet. And on top of all the Covid you kill of Deluca. Seriously. Stop it.
1	Years of setup and smart thoughtful writing to be ended with what felt like a paper that you forgot was due tomorrow. Storylines completely ignored. Tone of character and season changes. The entire last season is a drag. Prior to the last season the series is a 9/10.
0	I had to create an account to express my anger at this adaptation. I will applaud it on its visuals, but I cannot give a dime for its writing nor canonicity. If you've never played a Fallout game before, or casually played Fallout, then yes, I can safely recommend this show for you as, on its own, is entertaining and is capable of being a satisfying watch, excluding some of the bad writing which could bother you. However if you are one of those people who've been interested in Fallout's world for a long time then there's a high chance you'll be disappointed by how Bethesda changes Fallout's west coast lore to retcon levels.Onto my criticisms. I mentioned the bad writing, of which I can tell you two cases of, one in episode 1 and another in 2. The first problem I had is with its introduction to our trouble. Apparently Vault 32's inhabitants had been all killed by a group of raiders who then dressed as them and yet nobody in Vault 33 was able to recognize during their trading session that these people looked nothing like the original inhabitants of the people they frequently contacted for trade? And in episode 2, alongside with its depiction of the Brotherhood accepting outsiders into its ranks (which it never did outside of Fallout 3 and even they had a major problem with it), the plot becomes suspiciously convenient by having the Brotherhood Knight act like a brutish idiot and land in the middle of nowhere just so they could stumble upon the leftovers of one of the other main characters. Onto the canonicity of the show, its egregious. The NCR is destroyed, for some reason in 2277 even though it was shown in New Vegas the NCR was still alive and well in 2281. And now their remnants have turned into a crazed cult. Ghouls are, once again, depicted as being able to survive without needing to drink or eat, I blame Fallout 4 for this. The Brotherhood, for some reason, conscripts outsiders whilst simultaneously being religious technology hoarders. And they no longer act isolationist, this is not okay because these guys aren't some excommunicated off shoot of the Brotherhood, they are the HEAD of the organization.Seriously, I would've given this show a 6/10 if I didn't care so much about the original games, but because I hate Bethesda so much I cannot give an ounce of support to this series. In my eyes, it failed.
2	What a rollercoaster. We were glued to it from the first episode and then came episode 4. Was not expecting that!!! Ended up watching every episode, had to watch every episode.It's so raw and funny... really funny!! And then heart breaking, uncomfortable viewing that you can't help but watch and try to understand.The characters are relatable, the acting is spot on and the story just keeps twisting and turning.It almost makes you want your own stalker but then at the same time gives you the absolute fear that a stalker would choose you.Life is tough and my life is better for watching this.Need to watch it again. You need to watch this now!! Be prepared though. Especially episode 4. You are not prepared. You have been warned.
1	The first episode okay...then it just got into the story of a gay guy in denial. I mean you are dating a transwoman...you might be gay. You meet a guy that I guessed was gay before they finished their first dialogue in the bar. Then he knows the guy is basically raping him while he is drugged out and keeps coming back...gay much? Yeah the plot at this point just got boring...drugs, gay guys, rape, drugs gay guys rape...wash rinse repeat. I couldn't get through the entire third episode. I mean if you are gay with a rape fetish...then this is the show for you! Otherwise this is just seriously deranged writing by someone who is either bored or demendted.
0	So let's start by stating that I've never played the games so I'm writing this as someone who is coming in cold to this world and these characters.I thought that I could watch Walton Goggins in anything, but after half of one episode then had to revise that idea.These observations are mild spoilers for the first half hour, but not for the season.So, the first five minutes where nobody in the house notices the intense flash of a nuclear bomb detonating was odd since it was pretty damned bright.Then a raid where the victims were still reacting with surprise 5 minutes after it started.Then another few scenes in a training camp leading up to a completely baffling promotion.Finally some poorly scripted cartoon like villains digging up Goggins.Maybe there's a reason that this seemed so poorly written and directed that fans of the game might understand, but it seemed like a very amateurish attempt to wring something from a bit of gore and a bit of lore that has completely escaped me.Shame, because I'm a big fan of cartoon like gore and also science fiction.Maybe this will do it for you but it certainly didn't do anything for me.
1	This is outrageous, how come the Japanese speak their language and then when comes to speak Portuguese they speak English?I am Loving the story, quite interesting visuals and costumes but by not speaking português makes the show not an accurate story and lazy production.I can't wait to see what's coming up but I doubt it will get any Portuguese language at all.What struck me is that nowadays there is so much tension about multiracial and equality and now we see this happening it's a kind of offence by not speaking the right language. Can you imagine if the British spoke American? Or the other way around?
1	Whats going on here.. started ok and interesting. I'm thinking YES let's see where this goes... then by episode 5 and so on... WTF.... That Thomas Wade character is a horrible unlikeable person just horrible, it just didn't work for me. To many unanswered questions, to many WTF moments.. it didn't gel together, sloppy badly written... Fighting a threat that's going to kick your head in, in 400 years... the cancer guy.. Ade Edmondson.. the ship... China 50 years ago, the Chinesecop (but not a cop) .. what a mess... the only thing positive thing I can say is Eiza González is probably the most attractive woman on the face of the earth...
0	I really wanted to like this one , but I fell asleep any time I watched an episode.So dramatically boring !!!What is the purpose of the videogame ?Why should we be shaken by aliens arriving in 400 years ? Let's hope they get here right in season 2 otherwise... what is to see then ?And the wallfacer? Shall I think there will be a mistery to solve regarding the choice of Saul Durand as a wallfacer ? Is it even interesting ?I don't know anything about the books and I don't even think I want to know anything about them .After 8 boring episodes we end up with a clear .... To be continued .... No climax really.
2	Shogun stands out as a rare gem in today's television landscape. Gone are the days of sprawling epics that delve deeply into a foreign culture. This series is a magnificent exception, weaving a masterful narrative rich in the tapestry of Japanese customs and traditions. It's not just about sword fights (though there are some!), but rather a captivating exploration of leadership, loyalty, and the intricate dance between those who rule and those who serve. Be prepared to be surprised by the lengths some will go to in the pursuit of power and the unwavering dedication of others. If you crave a show that goes beyond the clash of steel and offers a deeper, more nuanced story, then Shogun is a must-watch.
0	Mariko blows up, and that's it? Don't we even get to find out why? What a terrible way to mar up a good show. After nine episodes just to have a major character sacrifice herself for nothing and we never learn what happens to anyone else. That's just weird. Why would they stop it there? I've never read the book -- is that how it ends? I might never have started watching if it was going to end so cimpletely inconclusively. I mean all those other hostages in the locked room and that's it. I just don't get why they stopped there. It's like a dirty trick on the audience. Who lived, who died, what happened, who cares??? Dumb. Just dumb.
2	I don't really write reviews, I'm a lurker. But I grew up with Fallout and I have somewhat dreaded what this series could end up being. I did not like Fallout 4. I ignored Fallout 76. But I shall speak my piece for those who care to partake.First, I have some issues with the presentation visually. It feels quite plastic. There are parts that feel so CGI that it grinds my gears. Secondly, some character choices seem convenient rather than logical. Thirdly I would have liked further development of some.But in the end I surrender. They did this the way it should be done. This show does Fallout in a way that games as a medium should not, they actually made a show that added to the universe in a pleasant way. I'm not here to spoil anything, so I won't elaborate further. But if you like the games, and we're talking 1 to New Vegas, you should se this. At least, you should know that you needn't woory about doing so.Yeah. It's the bomb.And I had a blast.
1	3 body problem is a passable series to watch but can also leave you a little frustrated.The acting from the older actors, Wong, Chao, Pryce and Cunningham are excellent and steal the scenes. Jess Hong does a decent job too. But, the others, not so much.The other characters I found dull and irritating. I didn't care for them and I didn't enjoy their stories. I didn't feel any empathy for them and this can only attributed to one of two reasons, the acting or the writing/adaption from the books.Some episodes are okay, one is fantastic, but most felt like fillers.When I saw it was the writers from Game of Thrones who infamously butchered the show and ruined it, I was hesitant to watch this new series.The finale is very underwhelming and left me feeling that I just wasted my time on all the episodes. It was not fulfilling, or left me on a cliffhanger or begging for a season 2.If you got time to kill, it's an okay series.
1	"I came into this without any expectations. Having watched The Talented Mr Ripley so long ago that I barely remembered it, I took the story as it was told without comparison to the movie or the books.The acting was great, the black and white cinematography very striking, and the understated humor many scenes didn't go unnoticed.I got to the last episode, prepared for an interesting conclusion and waiting to see how he would pull this next con off. But then came the most disappointing part of the entire series. Not only didn't the inspector recognize him through a very thin disguise, using the same voice and mannerisms as ""Richard Greenleaf"", but he also failed to recognize THE SAME ASHTRAY! It put me right off the series at that point.Still, 7/8ths of the series was good, so I rated it a 6 overall."
0	...but didn't stay. Possibly the biggest problem is that the trailer gives the idea this is a comedy at any level. It even feels like one, for a little while in the beginning. I couldn't handle it beyond one and a half episodes, it was just getting worse and worse in terms of how disturbing the story is. Three stars for great acting. Minus seven stars for Netflix misdirection. It may be good, but not for me (or really for anyone who wants to be entertained or stay in a good mood.) Perhaps the perfect choice if I was looking for a story of how bad one's life can turn out when one makes the worst possible decisions in any given situation. I wasn't looking for that.
2	This is actually an incredibly good show with a good solid storyline that keeps viewers entertained and engaged. Now with that said I really kind of hate shows and movies with the whole retro future type thing it really kind of annoys my senses. I'm pretty much all future futuristic all the time still what they did with this show is nice. It's enough gore to keep people satisfied with some what real world challenges(if the world was post apocalyptic/post war) kind of a way the writers did an excellent job telling Fallouts story and the actors played they're parts brilliantly there was no cheeky over acting and the roles that some of the actors had were done pretty well they had dark comedy and enough guts and mayhem to have a good melody. It's not jump out of your seats action with huge expensive explosion(that I like too) it's just good cinema.
2	"I have been watching faithfully this new series just out of curiosity at first, then out of a sort of devotion even. It really jumped out at me though on the last episode to question exactly what sort of category this program fits into. I felt mostly all along that it fit into the drama/comedy category, but a few things along the way and especially the season finale made me wonder if the show is not intended as a ""farce"" or ""spoof"" or at least leaning that direction in its comedic aspects. Consider all the professional lines the characters cross in every episode--easily several times each episode. Examples are obvious, such as talking about their personal business when patients are being treated (fully conscious patients too!); or the constant sexual involvements besides Meredith's and Dr. McDreamy. But the final episode bordered on hilarity with the conclusion of the interns being put on time-out, lined up in the hall like so many school children, and being put to task planning a PROM of all things, like any hospital could ever have time for THAT! The patient whose doctor had pledged to marry him but missed being at his death bed while trying on different prom dresses, and who ultimately lays in bed beside him after he died, was SO over the top, and so FAR across every boundary, I had to conclude that I was supposed to be laughing at this. In fact I did. My mother and sister, however, fell for it all and boo-hooed. I would be curious to know if anyone else thought the final episode was meant to be funny, or was I just in some strange state of mind? sawznhamrs@sbcglobal dot net to me! Dave"
1	Season 8 had all the hype....SPOILERS>>>>>>>years in the making, blah blah. The storyline is as if it was written by a group of children in their lunchbreak. The build up of the Whitewalkers war fizzled into nothingness. I am Up to episode 4 ,It seems that the story is just appers to be a vehicle for femisim, the Dragon Queen doesnt want to let John Snow (The rightfull heir to the throne ) have the top job, he crumbles and like a besotted child gives all up for love, how ridiculous! Arya Stark (another woman) stabs the Head Whitewalker and kills him, whitewalkers gone......that was a letdown. Now because John Stark tells his sisters the truth and says swear not to tell a souls, why? because we are family???? They aren't family, hes the rightfull heir to the Targarian Clan. This story is rubbish. Oh and then we switch to Cersei (KIngslayers girlfriend/sister) another strong and powerful woman, is going to destroy them all to get the Iron Throne! Killing all her innocent subjects in the process....how dumb. Oh and Kingslayer is riding back to be by his sisters side after doing the Big chick who he Knighted???????? Please get some intelligent storytelling back into this show in the last few episodes. And stop with the Rampant Femisim please.
1	"In today's law enforcement shows are becoming to be more politics and less real police work, in many of the shows sometimes you feel you are watching tv lecture and not tv drama. The tv writers today don't know how to write it well. In ""The Rookie"" it feels different, we still have the idea that cop work in the 2020's is different than it used to be but it feels natural and not preaching. There is dealing with race and over policing but it feels the writers don't show it in black and white they give us the gray area. There is good and bad in everything. Nathan Fillon is great as a 40 years old rookie, he can do comedy and drama well with the rest of the cast. The plots are good up until the season 4 opening (the action in Guatemala was ridiculous) but the rest is good.Also need to say that when two of the lead actresses got pregnant the writers just wrote in the show and didn't try to hide it with coma and other ridiculous stories that other tv shows do stupidly."
2	The original series (in Chinese) have always been criticized for its character building but it's exceptional in terms of setting up such a fascinating concept about universe and captivating story plot. At least in the first season, this show corrected the shortcoming of the book and made the characters way more relatable and genuine, Meanwhile appealed to a wider audience while kept its essence. Great job. The story is way bigger than earth, human and our universe. And I agree with most reviews, the visual shows the budget. Can't wait for the second season. I hope Netflix continues this series.
2	The beauty of the book is it enables the reader to imagine the scenes, how different character will look like, sound like. Agree that this is far from what i imagined but it gots the right ingredients, and ive to say, comparing to other sci-fi tv show, the story and the scope of this story is truly extrodinary.One major issue is that things seem to be moving too fast, the wallfacer suddenly announced at the end might be confusing for audiences who haven't read the book (it is again, a very unique concept and one might mind it quite counter-intuitive: giving so much power to 3 person); i think the cast is alright, nth too extraordinary for the Ox 5 but i really love Wade's character.Hope there will be season 2 and it can show the real scope of the book with a little bit slower pace.
2	... This is THAT good! It's truly a tour de force (and forgive me for using that terminology but omg! OMG! When you write something this significant AND do it the justice it demands in the acting.. I mean... Ya 'tour den force' is the only fitting phrase) - it took me awhile to truly appreciate what I was looking at, what he was conveying and why but.. Sheesh! And lemme tell you right now, a 9 from me is exceptional! (for reference I reserve tens for things like an Attenborough nature documentary, or maaaybe Rick and Morty but both of those are for different reasons - I never bestow the NINER - but it's warranted - congratulations man, you should be very VERY proud - THANK YOU for this! Thank you FOR YOU!
0	"First of all I understand that this show isn't exactly how police do their jobs, it's not a reality show or documentary, it's a TV series/show.Still the first 2 seasons were promising and very well casted, scripted and filmed.The last 1-2 seasons the show got derailed and I read more reviews of people who agree.The Bradford and Chen (who gained a lot of weight btw, check her outfits this season and then compare it with the first 2 seasons) angle is so predictable. They had a moment in the previous season when Officer West passed away and they always seem to end up together but the ""undercover"" operation with two (not one but TWO) lookalikes is lazy writting in my opinion.I am sad to see the show going downhill. The mistakes they make in how the police approaches certain situations changed a lot, more and more procedures are being violated and where is the IA (Internal Affairs) when you really need them?Maybe it's for the best that IA (Internal Affairs) isn't there anymore otherwise nobody would keep their jobs, especially after Guatemala.Cops who got shot at aren't protected anymore (as opposed too the first two seasons) but the strangest thing for me is that people who have been through so much together still feel the need to lie to each other or withhold information. Like seriously? That's just too easy to use as a way to create a situation that could easily be avoided.(for example the whole Wesley/Angela/Elijah situation).It was sad to see Jackson getting killed and written off the show like that. He was a cool and likable person.What I also noticed is the whole woke introduction, which I don't mind but sell it better, make it more believable. Hell, even put a transgender cop in there, I don't care, as long as it's believable.The two-parter with FBI agent Simone is a perfect example of how this show changed and it was also the first time I skipped through a couple scenes. If this were to be a comedy show I would probably not watch it but at least it would be believable. Her introduction wasn't that bad but when she stepped in the meeting like that, came too late, opened her mouth with all those people there, higher ranked officers was unrealistic.It made me sad to see the show this sloppy. When you look at the show in season one and two, there is no way anyone would get away with something like that, she would get suspended and as a trainee/rookie, you are off the force.Because of episodes like in the last season it's hard to see what Nolan, Chen and Jackson had to go through in the first 2 seasons to make it as a cop and be taken seriously. With all the amazing arrests, human lives saved, advices given and cases solved those three still had a hard time becoming a P2 cop. And now.... well, now it's lost it's value to become a cop.The show has 3 options here;-needs to go back to the well written, acted and filmed series it was (my favourite option)-cancel the show-rename it because this is not The Rookie from season one and two, this way you are just fooling the audience."
2	"It's the best thing I've seen on netflix. That's fair enough right?Ok.. some of the competition has been lousy.But this is good. Really good.Right now we seem to have a number of extraordinarily talented people at the very top of any and all the various creative profession's Ok. Back to ""Ripley"".Andrew Scott is A Psycho.. OK.. A Brilliant Psycho.The magnificent raw material Patricia Highsmith gave us must have been daunting for any Production Company.The legacy of Anthony Minghella 1999 film only increased that.The character that is Ripley is so complicated, so many things to so many people makes describing him personal.Andrew is so fantastic. He must be as brave as a lion to have taken on this role with all the baggage it brings.Making it in Black and White when our memory of *The Talented* is full of such colour is smart. Jude Law and Andrew Scott are so different is also smart.This is a completely new take on this story of a man on the fringe of everything in society. He sucks the fruit out of all he encounters.A modern Vampire for the Atomic age.The cinematography, staging, costume all brilliant.I'm not going to binge watch this. One episode at a time to savour all its angles.Number one slowly builds the momentum.Introduction of Marge and Dickie another slow burner.It only gets better.I'll watch it many times."
1	It's not a bad series with some interesting writing and casting. But, also some very boring writing and ridiculous casting.Liam Cunningham is great! Benedict Wong is absolutely fantastic! And, Jess Hong is also pretty good in her role.However, Eiza González is an absolutely terrible actress. Constant scenes with her poor, ridiculously forced acting of her crying or moping with her buck teeth hanging out, lips gaping open waiting for the insects to fly into her mouth. She so poor that it's just shameful casting with how good Cunningham and Wong are. Just a terrible casting for one of the meaningful, important characters in the storyline.
2	"There are many things done right in this show - the casting, the story, the attention to the details, the following of the already developed concepts and ideas. Take, for instance, one of the main characters of the show: the power armor; it's designed to look and behave just as in the games, so it has a real feel of a heavy force and slow-but-lethal feel to it (also, seeing Kyle MacLachlan in it is a sheer treat) - and there's many similar concepts taken ""as they were"": robotics, vaults, suits, guns, medication etc.Speaking of the story, it is perhaps not the most engaging one overall, but at the same time it's only the first season, and it's also engaging enough.Speaking of actors and characters, I think everyone's great and right where they belong in this show - I wouldn't focus the attention on anyone in particular as I think the whole ensemble is what really gets it going. And a special thanks to the people who built (or animated) the power armour - if I were to dedicate the praise to one character, that'd be it.With all the greatness, there's a surprising number of goofs: endless rounds in a six-shooter guns, lack of lights on power armours (when even pip-boys have them), unclear difference between some vaults etc. It doesn't spoil the show, but it's odd given it's based on video games where all these aspects are at the core of the gameplay/storytelling.Overall, I've enjoyed the show - it's gory, cooky, bizzare, infantile, peculiar and vivid. It's great."
0	"Remember ""Another life"", the abysmal netflix show where a supposedly handpicked space expedition had its characters display the mental state, intelligence, tropes and team dynamics of a random group of college freshmen sharing a flat? Well, the netflix ""Three Body Problem"" will bring you the exact same experience, somewhat propped up by a much larger budget and sometimes using the source material. This time though, we have a bunch of characters with the dynamics of a generic soap opera who are supposedly world-leading physicists.Ultimately, even as a stand-alone source, the show is passable at best. Characters are extremely flat, dialogues feel from forced to outright cringeworthy in how much they mismatch the characters and their delivery. The ""streamlined"" story feels overloaded with irrelevant points at the expense of the main storyline, which seems to minimise the ""science"" in ""science fiction"" It's insulting the intelligence of audience with its avoidance of anything remotely beyond the most basic science. ""The Expanse"" showed you can make a great show and still introduce physics concepts to the viewers, who will love it. Whether by incompetence or indifference, the Netflix ""3BP"" seems to be unable to do it. The source material means it's still an Ok watch, but if you sleep through half an episode, you probably won't miss anything.As an adaptation the show is terrible. The plot has been butchered with the key message and theme completely missing, replaced with soap opera nonsense.The character swaps by themselves aren't good or bad. The should could have been a great opportunity to represent a female lead in a male-dominated field like physics, like ""Queen's Gambit"" was for chess. But the lazy fashion in which the swap was made, combined with poor acting means that this opportunity was missed."
1	Very good series but super annoyed that every series has to have some sort of lgbtq character, it's not even realistic to have a female trying to be a male character in a apocalyptic series , the show is supposed to portray fallout not modern times 👎 I hope that in the future tv can go back to being entertainment and not propaganda for the left or right party. Americans do not watch tv to gain political perspective and tv today is so centered on this it makes it super hard to get into a series that is good , such as this , good tv show but gotta deal with the bs modern times politics , seperate it from entertainment it's not that crazy!
0	"The remake of the 80s series ""Shogun"" presents a compelling portrayal of feudal Japan, yet falters in its casting decisions. While the storyline remains captivating, the actor portraying Blackthorne lacks the depth and authenticity of the original.My main issue with this series is cultural representation, notably in its depiction of Portuguese characters. Despite every other actor (Spanish, English or Japanese) speaking their native languages (a hurdle to keep up sometimes), the Portuguese speak English. A terrible portrait of what was the biggest empire of the time. Additionally, the cultural mismatch detracts from the overall immersion of the narrative."
2	Wow, this is actually really good!I have to start my review by saying i never played the game so I entered with zero expectations, so im telling you when i binged this entire thing my mind was blown away. This is wonderfully done, shot, written and directed!First episode if you're like me unaware of the game wouldn't make a lot of sense, but when you go further you'll get attached to each character and the story itself. About the story, I've watched dozens of apocalyptic works and even games, not so much time ago the show Silo nearly had thhe same idea but surely different potentials. What I found interesting in Fallout is the philosophy about the apocalyptic world they're living in, how in an a capitalist society we well always end up like this, and the motivation behind each character to still live this awful life and their narratives is what singled out Fallout for me!
0	This remake of Clavells Shogun is inferior to the previous incarnation with Richard Chamberlain and Toshiro Mifune is every way. In the first Mini Series the writers followed the Novel exactly all the way through. In this version they deviated, beginning with Rodriguez going overboard, and then washing up on an Island, found and rescued by Kasigi Yabu after he washed up on the rocks.Then when Toranaga puts Blackthorne in prison, he meets Friar Domingo, who very briefly tells him of the black ship but not it's importance and the writers leave out all the detail and his learning Japanese is left out completely. The way he leave prion is totally different and his instruction of Toranaga into the partition of the world by the Pope in the Treaty of Zaragoza is glossed over so quickly that it's importance on the story is lost. Blackthorne's desire to pursue the Black ship is lost. In the book that is the thread that ties the entire plot line and all the characters together into a wonderful novel. The assassin from the Tong that comes in the night is after Toranaga in the current version whereas in the Novel and mini series he, now a she, was after Blackthorne.
2	A lot of humor and a lot of heart, no one but Nathan Fillion could carry it off. This show reveals a different kind of policing from people with empathy. Like a typical morality tale each episode may highlight a lesson in life but I can tell they can dig a little deeper with the through lines in the plot. A lighthearted show with a few dark spots here and there to deepen the connection with the characters.
2	"EPISODE 01 - ANJIN:""Shogun"" dives headfirst into feudal Japan in its premiere episode, ""Anjin."" Lush visuals and intricate costumes transport viewers to 1600, while the story unfolds through the eyes of both a powerful warlord and a shipwrecked English pilot.The episode masterfully establishes the complex power dynamics and cultural clashes at play. Lord Toranaga navigates political intrigue, while John Blackthorne, an outsider, struggles to adapt to Japanese customs.While the pacing might be slow for some, the deliberate approach allows for nuanced character development. The episode doesn't shy away from portraying the realities of the time, and a thought-provoking closing monologue challenges viewers' perspectives. ""Anjin"" sets the stage for an epic journey with its captivating story, stunning visuals, and intricate writing.9.05/10.EPISODE 2 - SERVANTS OF TWO MASTERSWhile not quite reaching the heights of the premiere, ""Shogun's"" second episode, ""Servants of Two Masters,"" continues to build the complex world and political intrigue of feudal Japan.The episode focuses heavily on exposition, laying out the motivations and alliances of various characters. While this can feel clunky at times, with characters delivering lengthy explanations, it ultimately provides a deeper understanding of the power struggles at play.One of the episode's highlights is the revelation of the Portuguese Jesuits' influence. Their control over trade and their willingness to manipulate for personal gain adds a layer of complexity to the political landscape.We also see the first signs of John Blackthorne becoming more than just a pawn. His knowledge about the Portuguese and their secret gun-running base proves valuable to Lord Toranaga.The episode isn't without its flaws. The pacing feels slow at times, and some of the dialogue comes across as overly explanatory. However, the episode is saved by strong performances, particularly from Tadanobu Asano, who steals the show as the cunning and conflicted Yabushige.Overall, ""Servants of Two Masters"" is a solid, albeit slightly uneven, episode that builds upon the foundation laid in the premiere. It leaves viewers eager to see how the various factions will clash and how Blackthorne will find his place in this intricate web of power and intrigue.8.975/10."
0	First of all, i played the Games and i love the Games. Okay 76 is not the best one,...but anyway... .I tried to give it a chance,...but NOPE.It is not my Kind of Series. It is not that bad like Power of the... but it is not my wishful Idea of Fall Out. Not really Funny, not really violent, not really cool but not even also really Bad. Not really Trash, not really DARK, Not really mine.It could be also a Netflix Series, or the HALO-Serial that is even not so really Bad, but even not really good.So guess i am too old, i stay with the Games and forget about this TRY to make a serial of it.But watch it yourself, it is the best way to find out. I lost completly all of my hopes, to get some good Filmversions from the Games of my Youth.
0	This rating is purely for the well acted but ultimately unsatisfactory and frankly unworthy Season 8 Episode 6 Finale of GoT. Not sure if it was D&D's intention to deviate away from or stick as closely as possible to GRRM's ending. Either way, for many - including myself - what had been a magnificent, game-changing series came to a rather sorry and mundane end. Rather like a magic carpet ride that ends in a nondescript industrial estate in the middle of nowhere. These beloved (and loathed) characters deserved a whole lot better.So, in order to cheer-up disappointed fans, HBO should forget about plans for prequels and spin-offs and announce immediate plans for a comedy remake of GOT with an entirely new cast.For starters, here are a few lead actor suggestions:Matt Berry as Jon Snow, Dawn French as Daenerys, Miranda Hart as Cersei, Kathy Burke as Tyrion. The dragons and direwolves, so excellent in the original version, would now have an opportunity to display their comic range.You can decide other casting choices amongst yourselves!
1	The showrunners crashed this series harder than any other in TV history.Seasons: 1-4, Incredible5-6, A bit slow but otherwise great7, No good8, AtrociousGood CGI dragons.
1	"I've been a big fan since the start of the show. But have disappointed lately.To sum up Season 5 in one word, it would be disjointed. The season started off with a lot of promise, carrying over from a great finale in season 4. The Rosalind Dyer storyline was great and was expecting the serial killer angle to continue. The first 10-11 episodes of this season were well written, tight, and continuous.The second half of the season came across like a hastily written mess. What happened to Rosalind's ""assistant?"" Who shot her? I probably missed an episode of ""Rookie - Feds."" I was also expecting more about Chris, the jilted ADA (who I think will come back as a bad guy).Storylines from earlier in the season seemed to be forgotten or diminished. Even the ""Chenford"" angle fizzled. That was very surprising. The two most popular characters (at least on social media), just became part of the ensemble.It was nice to see the growth of Celina's character and finally have some resolution, but Aaron seems to have gotten lost in 2023. More comic relief than drama. Same with Angela and Wesley. Also, lots of peripheral characters (husbands, kids, etc.) just disappeared from the show in the past few months. Belt tightening?The finale was good, viewed as a standalone. But it should tie back to the season. Not seeing that. Glad to see Aaron get in on the drama again. I believe he will be back next season.In fairness, the show that does a lot pf location shooting, the weather in SoCal probably played a big part in the season's diminished episodes. Hopefully everyone was okay. Lots of studio shoots in the final episodes. The looming writers' strike did not help either. I am sympathetic to that and totally understand. But my expectation was too high.The writing team is awesome. So, I'm setting high expectations again. Hoping for a ""back to basics,"" great season 6. 😊"
0	Made an account just to give one star after the s08e03 disaster. Terribly written, produced and edited. pretty much ten years and it turned out to be a huge disappointment.
1	All the brilliant work in the seasons before the last was undone for me, I couldn't give it less than 7 because it was so well crafted , if it had gotten the final season it deserved it would've been a straight 10
0	Look, it is beautiful, well shot and the acting is very good. What does this show a disservice is the age of the actors. Please do not get me wrong I LOVE ADAM SCOTT, he can do no wrong. His acting in this is also some of his greatest I've seen him do but I cannot believe in 1960 a bunch of people in their late 30s are running around Europe spending their parents money... I also had a really hard time seeing Tom Ripley's love, infatuation or obsession with Dicky or Dicky's life. I think the writing is at fault here and not the acting because as I have mentioned above, Adam Scott can do no wrong. Overall I felt disengaged, disenchanted and disappointed. Such a shame.
1	Is it bad? No. Far from it to be honest, but the little things I don't like it about it really get to me. The first and main thing I dislike is the character Maximus, he almost makes it unwatchable. He's a liar, a hypocrite, and somehow has the best luck, with essentially zero skill. I honestly hope they kill him off. Another thing I dislike is the cringy humor that happens every so often. Some of the humor is good, but other times it feels similar to Marvels attempt at jokes. I hope the humor gets darker the next season. Other than that, it's a great show, excellent set design, music is perfect, action is great.
0	"I have not read the novels, so this review comes from watching the series with no foreknowledge or expectations beyond hoping for a good show.And, maybe 1.5 episodes in I realize that I'm just... bored. Things are happening, from a random suicide, some graphics about weird particle flights from an accelerator that are apparently wrong and a 'winking' night sky.... but nothing makes any sense and there's no sense of tension or character development. I decide to cut my losses because my instincts are telling me that this will be all form, no substance that is going to make me frustrated.I couldn't quite put my finger on what bothered me and thought that perhaps the novels just aren't for me.And then I saw that the Chinese version was available on Amazon. I watched just the first episode of the Chinese (Tencent) version and I was spellbound. The language is almost always Mandarin and the subtitles can come pretty quickly at first. But, I was completely drawn in. There may be some fancy special effects in later episodes but I will take plot and character and tension any day over ""Wow! Look what I can do with CGI and Chat GPT!""The Tencent version has tension and character development. The scientist suicides are presented and clearly communicated as an international crisis and it's compelling and feels like a completely different story.I was finally able to figure out what was so wrong with the Netflix adaptation. It violates the fundamental rule of writing: ""Show. Don't tell"". The Netflix version is constantly telling us what's happening and telling us that something must be important... but it doesn't show why. It doesn't convey the story as anything but some kind of paint-by-numbers multimillion dollar special effects extravaganza.If they had spent a fraction of the money and just dubbed the Tencent version it would be 100X better for 1,000X less money."
1	As a person who played every fallout game to completion, including Tactics, this series has done a great job. But there are some cringe moments.In the game, sex was there, but the act itself was an abstraction. It was a PC game with a content rating. In this series, Lucy just outing and asking anyone for sex was weird. Maximus not knowing what sex was, but describing an erection he once had as a pimple was bizarre. A group of female dwellers unzip their vault suits to the waist exposing themselves during a ceremony. I laughed because it was so stupid I couldn't believe they just threw that scene in there. Checking off adult rating boxes could actually derail the story if the writers are not careful.Some errors in mismatched sets. Entering a vault through a building then exiting back into an arid desert. The Goul entering a 2 story farm house and exiting back through a different looking building. Sloppy...Overall the story is good enough and I recommend to watch if you were a fan. If fallout is new to you, then you have to go with there are no Integrated circuit Chips, yet alien fusion tech just showed up in this analog universe. And it does make sense.
0	Disappointing. This had the potential to be so good. The plot is very interesting but the unconvincing acting and poor editing make this unwatchable for me. I made it through three eps before I had to say no more. I understand that not every actor in a show is going to give an award winning performance, but this is really bad. I was literally cringing during some scenes.It truly baffles me how there are so many good reviews. I can't be the only person who sees how lacking in quality this show is. Because it's not just the acting. Some scenes are too long (like a panning shot that should have been half the screen time). A lot of scenes contain (unintentional) uncomfortable pauses between characters that could have been helped by a decent score, but nope. Not this show.I'll stick with the books on this one.
1	To coin a colloquialism...it was all boot and no cowboy.Brilliant production values. Very good acting all around. The cinematography is frankly, mind blowing. Every scene was directed pretty much exactly right. So what's the problem?The story was basically stalled for half the series. The first half of the series was full of adventure, warfare, cunning and intrigue to set the stage. Ok..I'm totally in...let's have the payoff.Then no payoff....and more no payoff...and the series ends with still no payoff.Good job getting me to watch to the end but bloody hell, the last 3 or 4 episodes was one long, slow, cliffhanger. Not cool, man...not cool.Nothing happened. Yeah, some stuff happened but nothing to move the plot along. Nothing was settled. The last two episodes were especially disappointing but I could kind of see this coming. There was way too much to do and not enough time to do it.I prepared myself for this but it didn't help. It still sucked. It's not the waiting for next season thing that bugs me. It's the having needlessly wasted my time for 3 or 4 hours that bugs me.You can only spend so much time looking out the window at a beautiful tableau. That's what this felt like. It was a pretty picture, not a story.
0	S1, S2, entertaining and enjoyable. S3 ruined by Hollywoke.
2	I was surprised when someone told me this series received only mixed review. Hmmm, it's made me wonder what the hell people want from sci-fi these days. The show definitely has a brain and is definitely striving to have a heart; but it doesn't have to travel far to find its soul. Superficially concerned with First Contact it's more about the lifespan of humanity and whether we deserve to inhabit our beautiful world and as the first season closes in on its ending the question looms larger sending its tentacles to every aspect human life. The actors are committed and the production values fit the proceedings and I'm looking forward to the resolution of some plot questions which give the show its propulsion. Keep going folks. Most of us are with you all the way!
0	Why westernize it? The good thing about the book is that it makes sense, it is contextually linked. We cannot identify with these characters, everything is too rushed, too cramped. The dialogues are BAD. Noone feels real. And can Netflix writers form two consecutive sentences without using the F word? Yes you are cool we get it, but it just sounds vulgar nothing else.Oxford five is a group of losers, these are not scientists at all. The big bang theory gives us more believable scientists, these are just talking... nothing serves for the story. Auggie is just irksome, i dont even care if she dies, while Wang Miao was a beautifully written character. Another disappointment.
0	There was a lot of attention for the release of this new series. After watching the first episode, I noticed that they stress the use of their Axon body worn cameras, and it's like watching a horrible version of Southland. The main Officer, John Nolan looks like Ed Helms from the Hangover movies.
2	It should be a perfect 10 out of 10 however as anyone who is a fan of the series will tell you after season 6 there was a pretty aggressive decline in writing quality. Season 8 was so bad that it literally destroyed any hope of rewatching the series at all, as all of it amounts to nothing now. Dan and Doug should never be allowed to write anything ever again for what they did to one of the greatest shows ever on television.
2	"Not passion, as in romance. Passion as in, I love what I am doing and I am going to get every bit of it perfect. Creator Mark Protosevich loves film, loves LA, loves the old hardboiled shamus films -- clearly not the case with the team behind Monsieur Spade! -- loves people, dogs, rare alcohol, fine cars .... you get the picture. Sometimes, it's rare, you find a production that overflows with such passion for detail you can get lost in the process instead of the content. Sugar has great content too, and Farrell, having landed the role of a lifetime, puts everything he has has into it. Special entertainment. Sip it. Savor it. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer."" Please check out my list ""167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))"
2	D&D proved to us that they can make a good adaptation if the source material is exists. The problem starts if it's not completed yet (looking at you, GOT season 6-9) Luckily, the 3 body problem from Cixin Liu is a complete trilogy, and I think so far it's good. The story is somewhat simplified, and moving less characters to keep the focus, but it's understandable. I do not like every change they made, but I still think that they made a good job.The characters are good, I liked Da Shi (the officer) the most, he is almost exactly how I imagined him.Maybe this will be a redemption arc for D&D. I'm rooting for them.Netflix, let the 2nd and 3rd part happen.
0	I couldn't finish the first two episodes and quit. They created a world, but the world has literally our modern culture with some sci-fi/fantastic creatures. The characters are stupid, and the writing is so off. In the first episode, they don't want to touch or be around outsiders, and in the second episode, the main girl walks around and wants to shake strangers' hands. All characters are literally stupid, but they look like they tried creating funny/goody characters, but it's an epic fail. Time wasting. I wish I could get my time back. Whoever voted this series high is the reason for my wasted time.
0	I loved Nathan Fillion in Castle, as the Octopus in Resident Alien. I loved season 1 and even 2. I loved when he reconnected with his first love and thought it stupid when she dumped him to go back to her loser husband. It really went down hill when he dates & asks his firefighter girlfriend to marry him. Her character is too unbelievable. She tells paramedics who to do their job. She runs into Nolan while fighting fires all over the city. Not only that but when Nolan has to go to an Army base, who's there and kicking bad guys butts? Yep firefighter girlfriend. And Chen hooking up with her former TO! I miss Nolan's old multimillionaire bed friend. I stopped watching midway through season 3.
0	As a Vietnam era veteran I could not wait to see this series. After viewing 1/2 hour of episode 1, I turned it off. Just terrible. The acting, the actors, it had nothing to do with war. I felt there should have been scenes that depicted a military camp or soldiers. It just didn't make sense to me. What was it about? Maybe I'm getting too old but I just couldn't follow the scenes or the actors. What they said made no sense to me. I expected a lot more from the individuals that put this together. The whole Vietnam era is very touchy with americans. I thought this would be made with A Touch of Class.Robert Downeys makeup was a joke. The other reviewers loved it. I will watch it one more time. But I don't think it's going to get any better.
0	"I know I used to watch broadcast TV years ago- and stuff wasn't so good, most of it. Cable brought some better shows- and broadcast had to up it's game. but there are still all the same cliché format dribble. I can't watch it. I was always a cinephile. but TV came into your home with ""stories""- so maybe if you re 12 or even in your 20s and this stuff is ""new""- this is not the worst police show on TV- that's why I gave it some stars"
2	I loved this series so much. Then came season 8 episode 3 and 4. Such a disgraceful ending.Seasons 1-4 10/10 Seasons 5-7 9/10 Season 8 (Ep 1-4) 3/10
2	Overall the show looks good and sounds good. The tone is perfect with all characters being ridiculous. I grew up with FO1 and FO2 and the show is more in line with later games but it's fineIt's starts to fast introducing everyone in 1st episode and then continues with weird cuts to different characters.The characters and not particularly likable with except for Walton Goggins, he is great. Lucy is like a mormon that never seen and outside world - the problem is that it is rarely funny. Maximus on the other hand is not relatable, why does he do what he do - what people hurt him and what revenge he wants to tak. Perhaps it is a set up for later reveal but right now he is somehow bland - is he good, bad, opportunistic. He seems exactly like Star Wars black trooper who was there but is not remembered because he wasn't well written character or really relevant to the story.Some people complained that many game locations are absent or destroyed. I guess they are right, there is a missed opportunity for many references.Same with the Brotherhood / Enclave. Looks a bit like like both factions were merged into one, but perhaps, again, it is a set up for later seasons.One glaring aspect of the show is ultra violence. Its a trend lately (The Boys, Gen V, Invincible and probably more). The game was never so bloody (although there were occasional decapitations). It doesn't really add to the show that much.Fallout is a really well made adaptation, it capture many aspects of the game. Its just overall the show doesn't make you care about its characters. Character motivations are unconvincing. The Last of US show managed it better. But still I hope next Fallout season will be better.
1	I don't know why other people like mysteries or thrillers, but I like a lot of them because they have relatable characters. They aren't rich, living in worlds I have no interest in. I really despise the excesses we're supposed to admire. I hate it. I want to see worlds where real average people are represented. Not some millionaire ahole, no. The British know how to create human stories, because as many issues they have with class divisions they at least examine these issues in their shows. But not American creators. Nope. The directors and show runners that actually get funded for projects here really want to shove a certain kind of lifestyle down our collective throats. I just really miss seeing human stories set in the US, about average people. Preferring shows shot on location with little green screen. This is not worth my time, but some people will enjoy this. It's not for me. I didn't think the character development was the least bit interesting, nor was the shooting style or yge world any of them inhabit.
0	"Never a major fan from the start, it was entertaining, but certainly not the greatest thing, certainly didn't live up to the hype. But all the greatest series are all defined by their last season. GoT team seemed to have just gone on a massive bender throughout the whole of season 8. Squeezed it all in 6 episodes, probably cos they just wanted it over with. They got all their success and thought ""who cares dude, we're done"". Scripting was shocking, acting was meh and the last episode dragged on for the sake of dragging on to just take a few more hours of your life.Weak, lazy, ignorant and disrespectful to the fans who wasted 7 years of their life on this show, only to be rewarded with this pile of filth"
1	"Seasons 1-4, I cannot argue with. There was always something going on that kept me at the edge of my seat, and I thoroughly enjoyed that. However, as the show progressed, I couldn't help but grow tired of the repetition. It's more of a soap opera now, which, if that's what you enjoy, go for it. I grew less and less interested in the ""who's kissing who"" aspect and just wanted to know what happens next in the facility. Overall, it starts off strong, but it's definitely being stretched out far too long."
0	This show was good in the first two seasons, that was before the writers started killing off everyone. As someone who just started watching four years ago and have binged the first seasons waiting for the recent ones to come out, the show is a waste of time and please don't bother watching.
2	"I finished watching ""Ripley"" on Netflix. Wow, what an excellent mini-series! It is a new take on Patricia Highsmith's ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"". Filmed digitally in crisp black and white, the cinematography is fantastic and a wonderful choice for the period. As for the acting, it is good all round, but Andrew Scott as Tom Ripley is the highlight - I cannot say enough about his performance, he is likely to win an Emmy. Dakota Fanning is good as Marge. Johnny Flynn as Dickie is OK, but he certainly lacks the charisma and charm of Jude Law from the movie - there is zero chemistry between him and Ripley or Marge for that matter. I certainly enjoyed Maurizio Lombardi's performance as Inspector Pietro Ravini and the rest of the Italian cast. Watch for Sting's child Eliot Sumner as Freddie Miles (not as enamored of this casting choice, it made me miss Phillip Seymour Hoffman from the movie). But this series overall is a must watch for Scott's performance along with the great visuals! Very highly recommended. 9/10 (I deducted one point for the casting choices of Flynn and Sumner)."
1	I'll be short: season 1-5 : vote 10 season 6 : vote 8 season 7 : vote 5 season 8 : vote 2Without Martin books, last 3 seasons started the descent into the abyss. Poor screenplay, awful dialogues, plot armors, plot holes, all characters have a regression, internal inconsistencies, incompetence in military matters. Disrespectful to the public and the author. I bet the actors will show their disappointment in the future. I really don't know if i'd recommend it
0	I have to clarify that the 1 atar given is only for Andrew Scott's acting which was the only surprisingly good thing in this series in addition to the fact that it was black and white.It is so painfully slow, every action, head turn, foot turn, him putting on shoes, him putting on coat for the 200th timo, every step pacing from one room to other, even Andrew breathing is shown. I am so surprised they did not show him wiping his a** in the toilet. You can easily skip episodes and not miss a thing. You feel like you are aging alongside the series.They have shown for 15mins, him taking body down the elevator...it is that painstakingly slow. Did they forget about something called editing and just decided to use whole footage?It could have made a good movie, the storyline is good although not something you haven't seen before....it is very predictable or very surprisingly stupid at times. But it ihas been annoyingly streched so long tht I am sure it has put a dent in time.People who have given it 9*, have a very different taste and way too much time at their hands.1* for good acting, lighting, location and clothing, 0 for direction, music, editing, and pretty much everything else.I wish i had not believed the rating. Watch at your own risk.
0	First episode has really turned me off from wanting to watch more.Why is this show done as if it's a horror movie? Weird fish-eye lense camera's, shake cam's, strange, dark atmosphere with horror movie music and characters doing lines like they're trying to be weird about it. Everythign is dark, rainy, misty, dreary as if it's all a vague, unnerving nightmare.This is supposed to be an adventure of discovery, of culture clashes, not this depressing nightmare.It's so...off, so weird.The old mini-series was fantastic. It had great and renowned actors, some of them movie legends like Chamberlain and Mifune. I'm sorry to say I know nobody who is in this show. All these plastic faces, perfectly sculputed by the best of cosmetic surgeons make these characters feel unreal and unnatural. They are too perfect, adding to it all an unauthentic feeling. They don't feel like regular people, they feel like beautiful, perfect actors.The direction is like a strange, ungodly mix of the worst overdramatized parts of both Western and Japanese movie-making. In the first episode, event after event just happens like ticking boxes on a list, it's so unnatural without any feeling of connection. That the scenes seemed to often be so short didn't help at all. Remember when lord Yabu gets introduced in the old mini-series? That's quite the scene. It's in no hurry. None of that in this new show, none of it, everything has to happen quickly and you never get to just sit and enjoy a long scene with good drama.The way the language barrier was represented in the old mini-series was very good, perhaps brought on by the fact that there was a genuine language barrier for the cast that made it all that more believable. They truly were a different class of actors.
1	The first season was great, second still good, third began going off the rails. The 4th was filled with cringe worthy moments. The one great actor of the show Nathan is almost like an extra in some latter episodes. And what's with Jenna Dewan's character? Superhero firefighter military? Is she also an fbi cia interpol agent that we don't know? Extremely irritating. Also, who thought that the bounty hunter character was remotely funny or that the new character simone wasn't completely ridiculous... season 4 was really hard to watch. I haven't begun the 5th and I'm really not looking forward to it. If the show was cancelled now I couldn't agree more - in fact, if someone told me now that the cast and writers knew the show was already cancelled, I'd immediately say: oh, that's why nobody involved in the show is caring. Yep, that would about explain it. Shame. I love seeing Nathan and hope they get decent writers back into the game like in the 1st season.
1	Well, it's over. This review is spoiler-free.I spent almost a decade with Game of Thrones. I have seen the first few seasons 5 or 6 times.If you are the type of viewer that enjoys the ride, and you don't really care where it is taking you, then Game of Thrones is a10/10.It has some of the best production quality, acting, and cinematography not just on the small screen, but in all of cinema.However, it does not stick the landing.Seasons 7 and 8 are very rushed and poorly written resulting in a whimpering finale that leaves dozens of plot holes unfilled while also leaving a dry, poor taste in your mouth.I'm not exaggerating. DOZENS of plots are simply forgotten. The most interesting things in the show mean nothing at all. The intrigue goes nowhere. You can ignore at least 75% of the interesting lore and characters, since they mean absolutely nothing.But, it LOOKS amazing, which is why it gets a 6.Also, if you are a student of acting, all of the actors and actresses are really spot-on, and the sound and music are unparalleled.Overall, Game of Thrones is a massive disappointment. It will go down as one of the most controversial and divisive series of all time. Its last two seasons are incomprehensibly rushed, and those seasons betray almost every theme and plot that the books spent decades refining.Even after all that, it is quite a journey getting there. If that's what interests you, then I cautiously recommend Game of Thrones with a warning that it has very little payoff.
0	Shogun way back, the first televised version, had far more elegance and detail than this version. Shogun 2024 is a darker, more mean-spirited version of the origanal book and TV series. It is also racing through the story, this version, omitting so much detail of the story of an English pilot findinh himself in an inter-clan Japanrse war. They have also changed the origiunal story line into a much more violent one than the original. The cast for the most part is outstanding, but not as exciting as the earlier TV version. They are duller, meaner, and darker. The absolute square man playing Anji-san is terrible in this part, the most impotant guy in the story. He is dull, excessively masculine and without an ounce of humor or grace. He is a blunt object, in this version, placed between warring ego-maniacs. Though lavishly produced, there is no grace to the photography or the staging. There are so many subt,le scenes in the original that are entirely missed here. Interesting certainly, but deeply flawed.
2	For the first 8 dozen seasons it was brilliant wish-fulfillment fantasy for nearly-braindead women. No other show could match the ingenious concept of having average to unattractive females hooking up with buff, gorgeous male doctors. Ka-ching!Then after the writhers finally got tired of beating that concept to death, with the smoothness of a popped-clutch they transitioned to preachy faux progressive hectoring in every episode. But that's fine, because the hook was already set deep into the maws of the landwhale audience.Really, even after 56 years on air, Gray's Anatomy is Hollowood at it's best.
0	Why is the only character I liked the one that is about to die? He seems like the only one that does not act like a child, but he can't because he has cancer. He does not have many speaking parts... maybe that is why I liked him.It also seemed like they were more worried about diversity of ethnicity than they were a coherent story. It was very choppy at times. Then there were other times where they were trying to be mysterious, but it turned out to just be annoyingly cryptic... I would watch a scene over and over again not able to figure out what was going on. Then 5 minutes later they would introduce a completely different factor and connect it to that cryptic scene and leave you more confused than ever. I wish they would have focused on older actors... it would have made this far more suspenseful... a good story is better than a bringing political correctness into a film. The detective has a kid and they had to make a point to tell the audience that the kid was gay... how did that move the story along? It did not... no one cares about how characters prefer their sexual proclivities, especially when it is a character that does not even have a story line. It's like they just needed to check the box... gay character, check. If sexual preferences are not needed to further a story line, then please don't bring them up to check a box. It's not that being gay is bad in a movie, it's just annoying that they spend all this time checking boxes when they need to be explaining the cryptic PLOT AND STORY! This is what is so frustrating about art nowadays... it can't bring you into the art without trying to pound specific views or narratives in your head... like we need lessons from Hollywood of all places.Anyway, there is not much that made sense here. Had SO MUCH potential if they would have just stuck to the source material and followed it. Instead, they wanted to check boxes. We should have an inclusive art industry no doubt, but it shouldn't be done like this. This is insulting to the author, the viewer, the fans of the books, and even the actors... because some of them are getting ripped apart for being miscast. Why does it hurt to stay with the source material and what works. Not every show has to have a gay person in it. Not every show has to have a white, black, Hispanic, or Asian person in it. Not every show needs to have a woman or man in it. We have SO MANY GREAT STORIES in this world to make, stories of brave, kind, funny people from every back ground... so why take those stories away from them and force them into stories they don't fit into (based on the source material, not superficial things).The Aliens make no sense. They lied themselves. Now they hate liars? They allowed people to call them Lord. They knew they were not a Lord. The original one said they were a pacifist and that the rest of them were violent, yet the ones speaking to the cult leader said they are ALL ONE and know what each other are thinking, so they cannot lie. So how is this pacifist Alien separate from the rest of them if they are all ONE?The writers and directors should have focused on STORY instead of checking boxes and they would have caught all this stuff.My favorite characters in the show was Marlo Kellys. She acted like a psychopath very well and I really wanted her to be successful in her endeavors. The way she uses her eyes reminds me a lot of Aubrey Plaza, who is an amazing actress. I think we will be seeing a lot more of Marlo Kelly in the future.
0	The beginning was great - that's until the writers decided to kill of every character. I started watching a few years ago and it soon became my favourite show. I'd spent countless nights binging shows while waiting for the next season, and now the show is a complete MESS. I'm upset with how all the characters either got killed off or moved away, especially the latest with Alex running and starting a family with Izzie. Like are you kidding me? The show spent 15 YEARS developing his character with last three developing his love story with Jo. They were soul mates and now after helping her with treatment and worked hard to get her to know that he loves her, he RUNS.WORST SHOW EVER AND ITS A WASTE OF TIME. YOUR FAVOURITE CHARACTERS WILL MOST LIKELY GET KILLED OFF OR TOSSED. It's also become stupid like characters sleeping with almost the whole hospital. Every character is linked through people they've slept with. I'm done watching and I'm disappointed greatly. I would love to go back in time so I wouldn't have even given a thought to watch this stupid show in the first place.Characters die or get tossed, they all sleep together, and make stupid decisions that doesn't match themselves. If you're into medical dramas that are on the more realistic side of things, this show isn't the one for you.
1	I have to say I don't usually like police shows, especially ones that have a new weekly case that get solved in the episode. However this has such fun and interesting characters with development arcs that run through the series that keeps you interested. Also the cases usually have an integral part in the arcs.Nathan Fillion is as always brilliant and the rest of the cast really fill this out.I find myself laughing out loud every episode, usually at Fillion's bad luck.I hope this gets a following and doesn't get dropped as it is quite different to anything about at the minute.
1	"I've watched it from the first to the 7th episode, and its quality downgrades on every new episode. Not gonna lie the first three episodes were very promising, the characters were very talented and well suited for their roles. But subsequent to these first three eps, the series started to become kinda ""Mexican drama series"", no story development, characters were just a vessel to reach the estimated screenplay timeout and repetitive ideas like ""Blackthorn kept asking for his ship back like kid"". Not only this but also you don't have emotions to the characters like getting sad or at least feeling something, because all they were doing is having sex and living their daily lives.What a wasted potentials!"
0	Nathan Fillion looked so PHONY with his perpetual scrowl and plastic smile. His delivery was automatic and awkward. Sorry I thought that Nathan could act.
1	"What I like most is the cast, the acting, and the production. Especially the Japanese actors shine in their roles (I had some difficulties with the characterization of the ""new"" Blackthorne). The story is, of course, well-known - if you have read the original book by James Clavell or watched the first adaptation for TV starring Richard Chamberlain. Additionally, if you know ""The Last Samurai"" with Tom Cruise, you will recognize many similarities. Regardless, Shogun is legitimate and a solid, well-made piece, good enough to kill some spare time. Conclusion: a good show, but it's definitely not the masterpiece that many other reviewers claim it to be. At least, that's my opinion."
1	"To make it short: The Rookie is an entertaining crime/police show and it keeps you watching, even if it leaves mixed feelings...On one hand, the producers are trying to show realistic police work, including authentic lingo and procedures/rituals, on the other hand, this is exaggerated by inexperienced cops having more shootings and high-profile operations in their first year than most real cops in their lifetime. At least, I hope a real LAPD department doesn't run like that, even for senior officers like Tim Bradford.Once you get over that, it is an entertaining mixture of action, drama, personal issues of the main characters involved and some comedic elements, held together by a motivated and diverse cast you can mostly root for. The Rookie puts you somewhere between action popcorn cinema and Friends, you just have to put your expectations right.The main weak point is the script, with cases way above the paygrade of patrol officers, things often happening too fast too easy and kafka-esque moments that would keep a show like Prison Break running for a season (or at least several episodes) usually resolve in 40 minutes of an episode. Some characters are written out of the series in the worst kind of way after their actors left the show and the tone changes in seasons 2-3 where the storyline revolves a bit too much around racism, police brutality and community policing to organically integrate into the plot. Research tells this was demanded by the actor of Officer West who is of color and wanted the storyline to reflect more on this matter, which is fine, it is as legit as making this a good-clean-fun police advert, if it is done right - but it sometimes just feels as if the story elements are there to make a statement, the social media human rights activist is just too much of a cliché, dealing with 5 jobs and your daily yoga sessions, etc...However, the biggest problem is that The Rookie loses the (relative) realism of the first season. There is an element of vulnerability in the season #1 that vanishes as the rookies move up the ranks. The chance of making career-ending mistakes adds to the drama but as soon as everybody passes their exam, they become pretty much unbeatable superheroes, casually surviving gunfights, even off-duty against several enemies. Nolan's first gun incident causes a major investigation, suggesting he was at fault, later on he shoots people in the dozen and no questions are asked at all. Taking away the ""beginner"" element also takes away a lot tension that can't be compensated, even by the sheer amount of over-the-top storyline. At some point, every character was involved in a major conspiracy, blackmailing or other type of major crime. Just out of their freshmen year, they can become whatever they want, undercover agents, training officers... even established cops in their ranks for years start to change positions and move up the career ladder after Nolan, Chen and West hit the scene.Another thing is how character build-up works, here... The mainstream characters are well-introduced and built up, but on the other end, just dumped by the of a season, I mean West is one of the main character for 3 seasons, then gets killed without further explanation and there's not even a funeral scene. Perhaps there was some personal struggle on set but I still feel there is too much lazy writing.Now this review sounds largely negative but the rest is actually enjoyable, character interaction is good and there is definitely chemistry between some couples on-screen and I like the comedy element. Production value and visual esthetics are top-notch, too.I'll keep watching but I wish the authors would aim for a little less than everything for the upcoming seasons and give The Rookie a more human tone, again."
2	I love the plot and story line of this series. I feel like there are so many possibles with story lines about life beyond Earth, and sadly there is just not enough of them.That's why I am loving the plot of this series. However, I feel like we were just getting into the story and now we have to wait over a year for a second season, if that even happens?It feels like half a season to set up the next season, which just shouldn't cut it. A season should be good enough stand alone, without relying on future seasons.I don't see why Netflix always seems to cap seasons at 8 episodes... insanely short.
2	I wasn't sure about casting Colin Farrell as an old style Phillip Marlow detective before watching this series but have been pleasantly surprised. He is following in some big shoes though really makes this his own. The self referencing clips from old black and white film noir are excellent and reinforce the style of this series. This script isn't as predictable as many are and has a pleasing amount of twists to keep you watching week to week. Pacing myself has never been a strong point and I'm glad I've been made to wait otherwise I would have binged all episodes by now.I hope this gets more series as the chemistry is good and I know by the end I'll be left wanting more. No.
0	The potential of the Fallout property is huge and this series is marred with poor writing, visual fx, timing, and acting.I've been a fan of the games for a long time and had immediate mixed feelings upon discovering a series was in the works. On the one hand, I was excited to be pulled back into the post-apocalyptic, war torn wasteland and reintroduced to my favourite characters and creatures. However, I immediately understood this could be another cash grab series, designed to meet the bare minimum for fans and simultaneously draw in a larger audience of new admirers. After watching the first season, the latter has been confirmed.There's are many times the dialogue is uninteresting and poorly timed, only exasperated by the lacklustre acting. The fight scenes are rubbish and remind me of a 1950s budget movie where the punches are feet away from the target. Moreover, the vfx and staging are so uninspired, it feels you're watching actors on a set.It does not feel like a show set in the Fallout universe.I would much rather no series at all than this poor excuse of a Fallout show.
0	Liberal writers sold out the show to the socialist propaganda of the the leftist ideology. White cop bad. Once again the left thinks people of color can't help themselves by taking responsibility for their own communities and need the liberal social experiment to tell them they need the help of the Democrats to do anything.
2	Short and sweet.Its a great series and just really fun to watch. Im just over half way through the series and im really impressed. It differs from the rest of the cop programmes. This is much better
1	It started great. Nice stories. Funny. Exciting. Good show to watch to pass some time. Interesting characters I actually like and / or are interested in.A just about middle age guy (perhaps a bit better looking than most, but that's just Hollywood) goes through some trouble and thinks he should shake up his live. Goes to the police academy and becomes a cop. The show starts there. He does cop stuff, wins some loses some.Then ... it seems they hired a few horrible writers that nixed anything positive in the show other than the acting. It starts to be not about entertainment, it's all about sending a message in season three. Never mind stories, never mind the narrative or the characters. I just stopped halfway through an episode and never bothered to watch another episode.
1	"Well I only wrote once something about something here (2012 - stupid movie) so this is my second ""personal opinion and review"" .. After marathon watching this TV show 7 seasons in 15 days I had to write and share something.. I wanted to do it from season one but, too lazy..for so long I did not want to watch this, but finally I took a shot.. All in all show is not bad at all.. There are some really interesting characters, great situations, good acting.. BUT.. Reason why I had to write this is review is ""Main character"" and the TV shows name GREYS anatomy..This show could be SOOO MUCH better without this ugly, repulsive, annoying, irritating creature - Ellen Pompeo.. My god !! What where producers thinking ?!?!?! I am saying again - 7 SEASONS I am trying so hard to like her, trying to find at least ONE good thing about her and her appearance/acting but useless.. I don't understand..I really don't, so if someone can explain to me why this ""actor"" is irritating people for 7 seasons please answer me.. So many good actors in the show which I really enjoy to watch and this idiot has to ruin it all whit her- trying to act, ugly face and terrible voice... ufffffI can bet that 95% of people (women) here would be SO much better in this role than she is !! I don't know what else to say and not to repeat myself, how much she is terrible and that I hope that I will NEVER again have to see this retard on any TV screen again..I apologize to everyone here if I am ""over the line"" but I had to say (at least one more time) what retard she is and she is a ""lead role"" in show... Can't believe.."
2	Cinematography is gorgeous. Costumes are great. Main character is an English pilot of a Dutch Merchant ship, who arrives in Japan in 1600. I really appreciate an American production being set in Japan, having a Japanese cast that acts out their lines in Japanese. As far as representation goes, I think this is the only right choice.However, they decided not to do the same with the other languages. When people are speaking in Portuguese, Spanish and even Dutch, the actors speak English. And as an American production, you do not want to have a series that is ALL subtitles. The series is made by and for an English speaking (and maybe Japanese) audience after all. I see a lot of people being salty about the amount of reading they have to do, or the lack of Portuguese being spoken. In my opinion, making a bilingual English/Japanese show is the best choice, ensuring the least amount of subtitles. They are able to reach a wide audience, ensure quality of performances in these two languages, and be respectful of the country it is set in. Would have been fun if it were a Portuguese production for accuracy, but is not.So, TL;DR. Looks and sounds great! Hope they keep up the quality. If reading buggs you, this show is not for you.
1	".....but it was just trying too hard. I appreciated it as a stand-alone show independent of the earlier film, though it was a bit hard not to draw comparisons.Scott was too old for a credible swap to be viable. He was also a very untalented criminal to be able to pull off what he did. Fanning did a good job but what on earth were they thinking with Freddy? What a flat, dull character, devoid of personality.I didn't mind the black and white but combined with the artsy camera angles, long stares, dark shadows and mysterious animals, it landed on me like someone is angling to be labelled ""the new Hitchcock"". Worth watching but didn't blow me away."
1	I would give the first four seasons 10/10. I would give the first six seasons 9/10. I would give the first seven seasons 8/10. But the last season has so many plot holes, bad quality dialogs, ruined character developments and, most importantly, the disappointment of main story. Thanks for the whole crew except the writers.
2	"Let me start by saying I love game of thrones, absolutely love the characters and world that it presents. The acting is INCREDIBLE, the cinematography is UNBELIEVABLE, and the writing (up until season 8) was FANTASTIC. However, this show is basically broken up into two different shows: game of thrones seasons 1-6, and game of thrones seasons 7-8.Seasons 1-6 were breathtaking and addictive. I never watched the episodes live, I would wait a few weeks and binge watch them on HBOgo. This was the best way to watch in my opinion because the show was son addictive that I would spend 5+ straight hours just laying in bed watching it. This show could do no wrong in these seasons, it was 100% the greatest show of all time.But then comes seasons 7 and 8. Don't get me wrong season 7 was still good, but it was easy to see that the writing was getting sloppier and it was slipping. The show spent less time on dialogue and story, and more on action and fast pace. Season 7 also set up the disaster that was season 8. What the hell happened in season 8? I won't spoil anything but let's just say that characters don't act like themselves, they make stupid decisions and act like they did in season 1. None of them grew to end in a spot that they deserved to be in. There's also too much time spent on nothing, literally in this season you will watch characters getting dressed, staring into space, sitting there with a blank face, or weird montages of characters walking. Seriously this show is about deceit, dialogue, and the ""game"" that is game of thrones. But nope they abandon it all in this last season just to rush the ending and try to shock you.Overall this show is fantastic if you ignore seasons 7 and 8. Even with them it's still a good show, but I can never rewatch it knowing that it leads to the conclusions it did"
0	I've downgraded my initial rating of 7 for Season 1 to a 4 for Season 2 as the story lines have become increasingly ridiculous. I won't bother to watch Seasons 3 or 4. The best cop shows about LAPD are 'Southland' and 'Bosch', both highly rated by cops themselves.
1	Visually and comedically spot on.This series hits every note that identifies it as a Fallout story. The characters are quirky and colourful, the landscape equally so.There are plenty of Easter eggs to keep die hard fans happy.HoweverThis series feels like it had several directors, writers and creators fighting over it, the result therefore makes for a somewhat jarring viewing experience.A lot of the comedy misses the mark and falls flat with characters saying some very odd things at odd times.Most of the scenes in Vault 4 make no sense at all.It's definitely one of the better video game to screen adaptations however could have been a lot neater around the edges.
0	So on Episode 5 the big reveal happens, the big plot twist is shown, and the best candidate for would-be villain gets killed. After that, the show devolves into a soap opera that only cares about the fee-fees of the characters.One of the characters is secretly in love but nobody cares because he's dying. Another character has hang-ups about decisions that kill other human beings but nobody cares because it's a war and that's just what happens. One character who is an actual nobody gets an offered unprecedently high position in the military out of nowhere and, again, nobody cares because nobody in the audience believes it makes any sense.Benioff & Weiss continue the Hollywood trend of failing upwards, after ruining game of thrones they come to ruin another series of books. Their touch shows in the blood bath that happens mid-season and tries to be Game of Thrones 2.0. And Just like in GoT, they failed miserably here.By the way, I'm writing this while episode 8 is playing in the background because I'm so bored of this show.
1	I was afraid this would happen - the series tries to be more accessible and interesting even for the average, 'dumb' audience. However, it doesn't work. The source material isn't Game of Thrones with twists and epic moments at the end of each chapter. So inevitably, it comes out flat and uninteresting because what the book excels at - its scientific side and detail for realism - is missing here. The viewer doesn't have time to properly like any character, so even if they all died, nobody would shed a tear for them. Music below average. What's especially bad is that despite Netflix's huge budget for the series, some scenes look cheap.
1	The classic idea that aliens are invading the earth is put to the test in the modern era of physics series. The concentration on physic theory is mediocre but the collision with anti-physic movement in 1960s is well played. How does this lead to a alien invasion? Well, it turns out to be a rebellion against humanity by a victimized physisist of the anti-physic movements. The communication with a alien intelligence occurs and once they learn of our co-existence, they create a push to invade. It's that simple but there is a catch to the equation. The Aleins will take 400 years of space travel to reach Earth. Once it's conceived by human society, the series just feels dumber. 400 years later...etc.
0	"This is the first ""Ripley"" video production I've seen, nor have I read the book. That said, I've nothing to compare this 2024 production to.I found the series seldom entertaining, but when it was, it hit the mark. Parts of ""Ripley"" were painfully long, boring and I struggled to keep from fast forwarding past those scenes or completely cease watching the series altogether.Mr Scott's Irish accent occasionally slips through, obliterating any idea that Tom Ripley is an American. I suppose one could imagine Ripley being raised as a second generation American born to Irish immigrants, but that bridge is a bit too far for me.The idea that modern filming in black and white can add an air of nostalgia has come and gone. It is pretentious, It is NOT novel, and it can subtract from any noir authenticity the production is attempting to illicit from the viewer, especially when it is done poorly."
2	Love this show! I watch a lot of stuff on Netflix now, but this is a must wait and watch weekly program for me and the wife! There is always different drama every day in the cop world, I expect this show to have plenty of good ideas for the seasons to come! Great work on this one!

0	"The Rookie is entertaining and fast paced - and could have been a great police show - but two things spoil the success:1) There are many mistakes in regard to police procedures - this is really a shame, because this could be easily fixed. Some episodes are simple stupid.2) All men in this show are either dumb or macho. All women are tough, smart, strong, wise and know everything - in each and every episode. Also men are constantly apologizing: ""Yes, Ma'am. I'm so sorry Ma'am."", ""You are right of course. Thank you Ma'am. I wasn't listening."". ""I want to apologize Ma'am."", and so on. The tough women fight convicts twice their size, have all the answers to all problems in the universe, and help men beeing less dumb - and of course help them apologize.This is a police show made by women, for women, where men act like in a woman's fairy tale - women lecture men in regards to romance, life, work, and generally everything else - like the former soldier female Chief - while wearing red high heels...Too much unrealistic emancipation in this show for me.Thank you Ma'am."
0	I prefer cinema over novels, but hearing about the budget of this show, and seeing the results, I can only assume that most of the budget went into getting certain actors on board. John Bradley's performance was cheesy af, any parts with cgi were cheap looking. The show felt low budget, but it's still worth a watch. Especially if you enjoy this genre, regardless of the films misgivings, I enjoy the questions and thoughts such a show brings to my mind. I have a sneaky feeling I'd love the books. Some casting seemed perfect, others felt forced, special effects department definitely didn't get any access to the shows huge budget. I watched it to the end, if we get a season 2, I hope they hand it over to someone else to take care of.
1	First two seasons had well written characters. Casting decisions seems to a solid positive and The interactions between characters were fun to watch. Show knew when to be funny and when to be serious moment and had me binge watch the first 2 seasons in a couple of days. Nathan fillion is amazing and has his usual charm.I recommend people to watch the first 2 seasons as these are actually good.Unfortunately from season 3 on wards show starts its decline. I don't really understand why every show from Hollywood now a days has to show the people of color as some sort of victims. As each episode progresses the show becomes less about cop show and more about pushing political messages.I was hoping this show wouldn't start virtue signalling. But after watching season 3 i was clearly wrong. And after reading some of ratings for season 4 , i realised that I should have stopped watching after season 2.
1	Why did the first Matrix movie become a phenomenon? Well, for all the storytelling and character buildup reasons that this thing lacks. An actor doesn't have much to go with if the dialogue is speedily written with the help of AI with no attempt to allow a personality to shimmer through the text. Lots of misplaced cursing and joyless wording of stale lines dominate almost every interaction. How did movies like Matrix pull off the girl boss or the wise captain etc. With a mixed cast way before its time? I bet they could have written this one well, had they allowed more imagination and personality when creating these characters. Cursing and smoking doesn't make one look tough. Rather a boring cliché comes to mind.
0	I was expecting to cry from my favourite characters dying in meaningful ways but instead im crying because of the writers betrayal to one of the best shows ever made.
0	*Grey's SPOILERS* Grey's Anatomy is the story of five Med Students - Meredith (Ellen Pompeo), the main character, Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), the Dr. Cameron (i.e. - annoyingly self-righteous - especially after her idiotic actions in last season's finale, which I hoped kicked her off the program - and the show - for good) of the situation, Alex (Justin Chambers), a breath of fresh air in this goody-goody show as the 'asshole', George (T.R. Knight) who should've been the main character, and Christina (Sandra Oh), an acerbic and ambitious person - and of their struggle through life as a doctor.Um... no.It's a soap opera, and a very badly written one at that; I like some characters (Alex, George, Addison, Christina, Mark) and keep watching to see what happens to them, but the show is really over-the-top, repetitive and laughable (Code Black - the Superbowl episode - was mind-numbingly bad, as an example), and worse, in a lot of moments sounds like a teenage fanbrat's bad!fic (hold a radio over my head outside your window kind of love? How DARE Shonda Rhimes ruin 'Say Anything' that way???).Enough with triangles and soap operaish story lines already!!! Oh, and if Isobel goes anywhere near Alex again this show is over.Grey's Anatomy: 4/10.
1	I love GoT. I think it's the best show ever which is why season 8 is a crime. It's laughable. A total joke and terrible. So sad
0	The first 6 seasons were great. Unfortunately the last 2 seasons have been sorely lacking. Dissatisfied disappointing and dreary!!!
2	Up until season 17 grey's anatomy was 🔛🔝 it is such a good show and I recommend it, if you love medical/romantic shows, grey's anatomy is for you. I really enjoyed grey's cuz it's mixed with the study of medicine and romance it shows us Meredith and how her life is like and why she became a surgeon it also showed support for the LGBTQ+ by having a lesbian couple (Arizona and Callie) and there are ALOT of tragedies like the plane crash the shooting episode etc, this is literally a COMFORT show, and it also shows us how people can change I honestly changed after I finished watching grey's anatomy, tho I stopped watching it after season 17 because all of my favorite characters either left or died, but overall it's such a great show and I really recommend it.
1	"Saying the f word every 3 words does not make your show edgy and cool. Swearing is not replacement for dialogue. Anyways,I've been a hardcore fan of the games for many many years and played everything from three to 76 and fallout shelter lol. I really really wanted to like that show but considering it was on Prime and the serious failure of other video game to TV adaptions I didn't have much hope and I really wasn't surprised when it was not that great and then happily surprised when it blossomed after episode 3. The show is excessively violent in the first episodes,to the point where it's not enjoyable to watch. It's a lot different playing a fake cartoonish looking video game and knowing that everything that you're doing in it is not real, and video game violence doesn't have the same visual and emotional impact as seeing a real life person's head exploding. That may be the world that they live in but there's no reason to watch it as ""entertainment"", it's just savage.. Not to mention it's an extremely lame excuse for not writing good stories and dialogue and just being like oh we'll just have them explode or be gutted that'll be fun right? Umm no.. Don't get me wrong the props,stages ,CGI and the power armor are great and accurate. Why is the brotherhood only men? Why is the brotherhood only men, it's not in the game. Why is there no trace of vault girl? I like the lead woman as she's so innocent and derpy that it's very comical and I like the ghoul, he's complicated ,he used to be good but he's turned so bitter/evil after living so long , being mangled,losing his family and knowing the truth. There's also the dark humor which I appreciate because that is a large part of fallout ,although it could be more dark funny and less goofy, but at least it's there. Maximus,siiighhhh. It's funny but he's also so annoying. The giant sack they haul around really made me laugh, over encumbered! They also made a mistake with the animals because they aren't bald /mutated but I do like the fact that they used real animals rather than animating them but they aren't accurate. If the second season is like episodes 4-8 then I'll watch it."
0	The trailers gave me hope as the books when I read them years ago were a globe spanning scifi thriller with unique themes taking place across the years.The book itself created a universe where you didnt really need to change anything yet you would still get a global cast of characters and a cool story.Sadly that is not what we get here, in the first episode you get race and gender swapped characters sitting in a lesbian bar talking about how smart and independent they are followed by all of the usual DEI tripe that gets shoved into modern tv.The interesting stuff in china gets completely overshadowed by the inclusive and boring writing layered ontop of what could have been an interesting show.. Even the suspense around the fates of the scientists is downplayed in lieu of talking about how smart and independent the female minority leads are... good one guys.
2	This is quite difficult to watch sometimes and it's quite unpalatable but it's so fantastically well acted and written. It's compelling and everybody should watch it.The premise of a stalker interlinked with vulnerability and abuse. It's dark but real and a part of this which we would all identify with. Sometimes when it's uncomfortable, you have to continue and I didn't expect a binge watch five episodes at once but I've save the last episode for another day as I can imagine it I'll be disturbing and emotional but it will resonate with me and other people that take the time out to watch this brilliant series.
0	During the first couple of episodes, the story deviated somewhat to the book although I didnt like, I understood.But cmon! The last two episodes is like throwing away the book and make a whole new story, great moments left out, Anjin never learns Japanese, the Mariko and Anjin relationship erased, they almost took out the Catholic plot line, the dead of Toranaga's son, and lastly Hiromatsu sepukku. All of those made me really dislike the show. If it works don't fix it, 1980 was far superior in the plot and acting, the book is a must for every fan of Feudal Japan, but this is an atrocity towards the book and so inferior to its predecessor.
0	Seasons 6-7 were very bad but season 8 was beyond terrible. It's like they deliberately made it bad.Acting was great but the writing from season 6 went downhill. When you start a story with so many characters and mystical intricacies, you better have some kind of plan how they generally make sense at the end of the story. Maybe G Martin didn't and that's why he can't finish the books.The tv writers didn't for sure, after writing the tragic comedy of s8. Such a shame and preventable because even without the books and decent tv writer should be able to come up with a better last season than they have.
2	After watching the sopranos, I thought this was the end of American TV. I didn't expect to have mad men. When mad men end, I thought there was no show to be a backup.This will be the work of god forever.
1	"I remember my grandmother saying to me: I don't care what they tell you in school, Shogun was black. /s""Shogun"" is a riveting television series that breathes new life into the timeless tale of cultural clash and political intrigue set in feudal Japan. Released in 2024, this adaptation brings James Clavell's epic novel to the screen with a modern sensibility, offering a fresh perspective on the classic story.From its opening scenes, ""Shogun"" captivates audiences with its stunning visuals and meticulous attention to detail. The production design is nothing short of spectacular, transporting viewers to 17th-century Japan with breathtaking authenticity. From the ornate palaces of the samurai lords to the bustling streets of Edo, every aspect of the show's world-building is meticulously crafted to immerse viewers in the sights and sounds of feudal Japan.At the heart of ""Shogun"" are its characters, brought to life by a talented ensemble cast. In the role of John Blackthorne, the English navigator shipwrecked in Japan, viewers are treated to a nuanced and compelling performance by Cosmo Jarvis. His journey from outsider to insider, as he navigates the treacherous waters of Japanese politics and culture, forms the emotional core of the series. Alongside him, Anna Sawai delivers a standout performance as the enigmatic Lady Mariko, whose wisdom and strength serve as a guiding light for Blackthorne amidst the chaos of feudal Japan.What sets this adaptation of ""Shogun"" apart is its willingness to delve deeper into the complexities of cultural exchange and understanding. While the original novel and previous adaptations focused primarily on Blackthorne's perspective, this series offers a more balanced portrayal, giving voice to the Japanese characters and their experiences. Through their eyes, viewers gain insight into the rich tapestry of Japanese society - its customs, traditions, and underlying tensions - and come to appreciate the depth and complexity of the culture that Blackthorne encounters.In addition to its cultural themes, ""Shogun"" also delivers plenty of suspense and intrigue. The political machinations of the samurai clans, the rivalry between the wily Lord Toranaga and his ambitious rivals, and Blackthorne's own struggle for survival all combine to create a gripping narrative that keeps viewers hooked from episode to episode.Despite its sprawling scope, ""Shogun"" never loses sight of its central themes or characters. The pacing is brisk, the storytelling is tight, and each episode builds upon the last to create a cohesive and compelling narrative arc. Whether you're a fan of historical drama, political intrigue, or character-driven storytelling, ""Shogun"" offers something for everyone.In conclusion, ""Shogun"" is a triumph of television storytelling. With its stunning visuals, stellar performances, and thought-provoking themes, it transports viewers to a fascinating and exotic world while also offering profound insights into the nature of cultural exchange and understanding. Whether you're familiar with the story or experiencing it for the first time, ""Shogun"" is not to be missed."
0	I used to love this show. But around season 12 they started becoming political and preachy. I haven't been able to watch the last few seasons because it's gotten so bad.
1	It's really a tacky adaptation to let the fanatical follower kill Jack. Immediately let this story slide to the Strange Thing level. If I want to watch the Strange Thing, I will watch the Strange Thing directly. // Why should the scriptwriter write about a romantic relationship between Wenjie Ye and Evans?? Does the big villain have to be crazy? This is very Netflix // After that (the plot progress exceeds the Chinese version) a few episodes are not bad. Xin Cheng's performance is too realistic, lifelike Virgin Mary. The rhythm is smooth, so as the plot progresses, and it is much more refreshing than the Chinese version.
1	You had the potential make the series epic, but the writers are too greedy.
0	Never read the book but had some friends who did and were excited about these series.So I watched the show on Netflix and my own impressions were: a) Didn't feel at all like a $20M/episode budget that they spent. Where did the money go?B) Overall OK and somewhat interesting, mainly due to lack of other new Sci-Fi shows with some level of originality.C) Lots of plot holes, logical issues, bad science that's basically magic, some facts magically appearing without taking time to solve problems and mysteries, lack of answers to many questions, and other issues that made me assume that the book was quite bad.D) Too much DEI, with the show not driven by pure talent but by the need to satisfy political requirements.But then I've decided to watch the Chinese series based on the same book, playing on Amazon Video. And that's when I realized how much better the Chinese version is at only $1M/episode. That one does feel like little lower budget but not big much. And is is very slow-paced at 30 episodes (for Season 1), but it does have much better story with actual mysteries being discovered and then solved, vs magically appearing facts and problems in the American/Netflix version.Now I've lost all respect for this Netflix show, just by knowing how much better, logical and mysterious it could be. Basically I'm very disappointed with Netflix screwing this show so badly.
2	Look I might be biased. In fact, I am biased because I have read the three books of the series and I think they are one of the best thing I have read in a long long time.When it comes to adaptations I am always skeptical because you never know how it would turn out. When I heard that the producers of Game of Thrones were behing the series I had hope, I thought they were going to do some justice to the source material, but I am glad to inform that they have surpase all my expectations.The one scene regarding an oil tanker (I will say no more), it was not done just right, it was freaking glorius, they pull it off and them some.I know they took some liberties regarding the nationality of the characters nut I understand the decisions that were made.The production was top notch, money well spend Netflix.The adaptation to the books (this first season included material from the first two books) was faithful as far as I remember.Acting was very good (special mention to the head of intellegence), cinematography and special effects were on point. You can tell they pull all the stops.I just can't wait for second season, peaple who has not read the books just do not know what they have in store for them.These books are not about the plot (in my humble opinión), they are about ideas, they introduce you to new and very interesting concepts about physics, game theory and even human nature in a way that is just mesmerizing, the wallfacer concept, just wow.I am sure this is a hit for Netflix and second season is already on the works.
1	"There is nothing science about this science fiction. The premise is intriguing but from there goes downhill faster than Game of thrones from season 6 to 8.The suspense is revealed very early on and after that it is like independence day/ Armageddon or any other 90s alien invasion movie you can think of.The supposedly greatest scientist characters are so unnatural that it is painful to watch. Same with one British cop who is calling the shots on everything about a war that is more than global.Even the aliens are pretty naive. They talk with human SPOC for decades before realising that we ""lie"" and then decide to eradicate us?Really? The hell were you listening for tens of years?Every twist takes it one step away from intelligent science fiction. Not even waiting for season 2."
2	I was skeptical when I first started watching the show but its so good. Jessica Gunning is such a great actor and really portrays the stalker as crazy as they can be.It really delves into the mind of someone who has suffered from abuse and how a simple hello can lead to drastic consequences. It is one of the best mini-series that I have watched and has just the right amount of episodes.It has many twists and turns and keeps the viewer gripped. It's not really for young kids to watch but I would definitely recommend it for adults. There is some scenes in it that are viewer sensitive but overall a really great series.
0	It started out okay but as I continued to watch it, it became more clearer to me what a big heap of crap this is. basically, all you have is a drama based on the nurses and doctors going from one to another screwing and breaking off or getting divorce from someone just to go and sleep with another only to come back later to get with the one they divorced or something like that. basically, the same thing. sex, sex and more sex drama. bunch of crap......don't waste your time....move on to something better.
1	I cannot understand why this show has such a high IMDB rating. It is ponderously slow with not a lot happening. I loved this book but this version isn't a patch on the book or the previous version. It's beautifully filmed with stunning scenery and amazing set design and settings but that's about its only positive.One of the major problems is that the actor playing the main character can't act. He delivers his lines in a tedious monotone showing little expression. This has had a huge impact on the entire production. His name is Cosmo Jarvis, they would have been better off with Cosmo Kramer.I have watched 6 episodes hoping it would get better but I won't be persisting any more. There is too much good stuff around.This is ridiculously overrated and isn't in the same class as numerous other shows with similar scores.
0	The show is so uneven and uninteresting. I'd go as far as saying it's one of the most unengaging series I've seen in a very long time. The actors are terrible, except for one actor who gets killed off in the first few episodes. Some of the acting is just plain wooden (for instance the Navy officer). There are a 2-3 thrilling VFX scenes but apart from that the show is very dialogue heavy and a lot of it is just badly written. There are so many scenes that are stretched out for no reason and you could easily fast forward the whole series and still not miss any crucial plot points. Honestly I watched it because of all the hype, that's 8 hours of my life I'll never get back!
1	What the heck happened in season 17? I feel like the writer(s) was/were high on some mind-altering psychedelic drug from the 60's! I love this show...or...did up to now. It is all so Helter-Skelter... a moment of craziness from the distant past. 9/11 flashbacks??? Really?? 21 years later? Talk about postponing dealing with a terrible event! I get having flashbacks this far in the future, but where did this all go in the intervening years? I'm sorry...but is just all too bizarre...the Meredith, Deluca, Derrick (etc etc) psychic/psychotic episodes. If it was just all dealing with Meredith's psyche due to her condition...but everyone seems to be struggling here! Are we really supposed to accept that it all derived from the Covid fiasco? Really? Come on!The good: seeing Derrick again. That's nice.
0	The scenes of the doctors doing their work are very informative and entertaining, but for every 5 minutes of screen time showing doctor work, there is another 40 minutes of soap opera drama.If you're wanting to watch a show about doctors, find something else. If you're looking for a better-than-average soap opera, you'll probably like this show.
0	It is the best of the best, but the last season esp final two episodes taken away all its fame into thin air. After hours of our investment i think we deserve a better ending.1st Jon would never kill a person like that according to the character that you developed 2nd Jon Snow is the person we look up to be the king, only he has all the quality to be the king. But jon was provoked to kill the queen but no one has even uttered his name to make him as king. He is the only person who has the concern and mercy for the people yo be the king.3rd what quality does the bran has to be the king? 3 persons sacrificed themselves to save him, but bran doesnt even has any sympathy for them, he was carried along by the mercy and love of others. He can be made as kings(Jon) hand.Please re do the final season, we invest our time for this, we do deserve a better ending.
1	Greed. There you go! I could end it right here.It's pretty much common knowledge that the creators of the show were offered a deal with Disney to make Star Wars content.Yet when they decided to prematurely rush the end of the show, in order to pursue their changing career goals, they never even considered handing the reigns to someone motivated and talented, to allow the story beats their necessary breathing room. We're talking at least 3 seasons.No way! They had to be the ones to close the book and take all the credit.After the dust settled, and people picked themselves up from the trauma of witnessing the utter annihilation of their beloved characters identities and arcs, they cried out in unison to have these blasphemers vanquished.Which resulted in them becoming known as the murderers of what could have been one of the greatest and most impactful shows of all time.Unfortunately, because of the show's structure, the damage is beyond repair. Most of the characters lead nowhere. Most of the story leads nowhere. Most of the setups shrivel and die before your very eyes.Because of their actions motivated by greed, there is barely a reason to watch Game of Thrones in its entirety. Not unless you don't mind watching a parody of the show you just viewed for tens of hours to close out the experience.There are some episodes that work great in isolation. There are some great scenes and some great spectacle. Maybe if you prepare yourself for immense disappointment it might be digestible.The only satisfaction, for me at least, is knowing that the creators lost their Star Wars deal and became branded as greedy hacks who thrived on some truly talented people's hard work and still managed to fu** it all up.
0	"So stupid when directors think they're being artsy by creating a whole series or movie in black and white. You aren't being artsy and it's not ""cool"". We've had color tv and film for decades now. The directors back in the day would've loved to be able to have their movies and series' in color so why for the love of god would someone create a whole movie/series in black and white in 2024??? It literally brings nothing to the show/film and takes so much away. It's not 1932, give us your movies/shows/projects IN COLOR. And if you absolutely must go black and white, just do flashbacks or something. It absolutely takes everything away from this series, don't waste your time watching and find something else that's, you know, in color 🙄 jfc."
0	Imagine a Medical show where you take out the wit of Scrubs, the excitement of E.R., and the drama of St. Elsewhere, and you'll start to get the feeling of what this show is all about. From the bland acting of Ellen Pompeo, to the pseudo-indie rock (Portions for Foxes by Rilo Kiley) that blares through every scene, this show is definitely aimed at the 18-35 year old demographic who happen to have penchants for over-acting and scripts filled with melodrama. I can't get over how everyone seems to be enthralled with a show that basically comes up with the worst catchphrases in the world, AND THEN RUNS WITH THEM. Why does America tune in every week for a show that makes The O.C. look like it was written by James Joyce. Mcdreamy? Mcsteamy? Mcgag me.
0	I was very surprised to see that in the low-rating reviews people often complained about the multitude of sex scenes, but nobody about the sequences that show explicit acts of murder, violence, aggression, rapes, animal cruelty... I agree, there is too much sex and naked women, but hey, are we already so desensitized as human beings, that those disgusting scenes are not a problem? My stomach is still confused. I had to cover my eyes at every 2 scenes. If children grow with this kind of evening movies it is just wrong. Also, the characters were developed superficially, in a poor manner. They were childishly divided between extremely good and extremely evil. If the movie is very accurate and realistic, why these non-realistic people? My two stars go for the costumes and settings.
2	I will review this by season.Season 1: 9/10 Love it.This is where it all started.Reasonable Drama.Season 2: 8/10 Liked it.Not as good as season 1.But still good.Still has reasonable drama.But not many interesting things happen in this.Season 3: 7/10 It was ok.Kind of forgettable.Few moments that I actually remember like Addison's leaving and Burke leaving.Season 4: 7/10.Still only ok.Better than season 3.But still only ok.The interns are now residents.Season 5: 10/10.Best of the early seasons.Loved it.The ending is heartbreaking.Fantastic twist.George O'Malley dies.Which is sad.But it was so good.But Owen comes and I like him.Teddy joins.Season 6: 11/10 if I could.But 10/10.The shooting happens.So stressful and thrilling.Loved it.Izzie leaves as well.I was left speechless.Season 7: 6/10.Not bad.Not great.Kind of boring.The finale was not stressful at all, and I was kind of glad I got to season 8.Meredith breaks the rules.That is the only interesting thing.Teddy leaves as well.Season 8: 9/10.The plane crash.Loved it.Lexie Dies.She didn't stay long enough but..ok it is what it is.Mark survives...not for long.Season 9: 9/10.Mark dies at the very beginning.Very sad.The rest of the season isn't particularly thrilling.But Meredith gets pregnant.Right after adopting that other girl in the beginning of season 8.Season 10: 8/10.Christina leaves in this season.I thought I would hate the whole show after this.But I didn't.It was really good.This season was really good.Season 11: 9/10.A good one.Derek dies.Which is sad.But it is a good episode.Also Arizona, operates on a neurosurgeons?

(he didn't stay long.) Jackson leaves as well.His last episode shows him and April reuniting.This was the final good season.Season 18: 4/10.Boring to no end.It is pointless by now.April And Jackson come back.Addison comes back for three episodes.Meredith is operating on Parkinsons on some dude.Amelia is apparently Pan sexual now. Because she is dating some bi sexual person.And in all the season is POINTLESS.The finale is nothing special.Stop watching here.Oh and that Denny crap in season 5 was weird.He was good in season 2. Sucked in season 5.Thank you for reading!
0	The pace of this series is way to fast! The Chinese version, though deleted so much content about Cultural Revolution, however it's pace is alright, the story unravels slowly and mystery being solved one at the time so it always got you attracted to the story.The biggest problem of this series is very similar to many Netflix series: They poured lot's of money in it, but there seems no quality control, so the scripts are always unchecked and nobody knows where the director comes from and then it always feels like the series is used for making quick cash and they never intended to make a sequel to this series, so the quality is always not so good and the rating is always quite low.
0	If you love shows filled with political correctness and virtue signalling then look no further than The Rookie.We have lots of wonderful left wing themes such gay, lesbian, racism, feminism, it's just amazing how they managed to fit them all into the show again and again. Season 1/2 were normal right wing then in season 3 the writers start introducing woke themes and just keep going. If you're woke and love virtue signalling then this is the show for you.
2	"Baby Reindeer has been receiving some great reviews, and I am going to add to that body of opinion.It was written by, and stars, Richard Gadd but with a supreme supporting performance by Jessica Gunning as Gadd's stalker Martha. In the stage shows, which provided the inspiration for this 7 part Netflix series, Gadd makes it crystal clear that it is an autobiographical story, in the TV adaptation this is less apparent. But it is all trueWe saw the Edinburgh Festival Fringe productions of Monkey See Monkey Do in 2017, at Summerhall, and Baby Reindeer in 2019, also at Summerhall but in the Roundabout.My wife is not always the most likely to join a standing ovation at a theatre show but at Monkey See Monkey do she was the first on their feet. I gave both productions five stars and this nearly gets the same, apart from the fact that Gadd as a stage performer, telling his life story, is arguably better than Gadd as an actor playing a character, based on him, but actually is him, Donny Dunn. This subtle change takes some of the edge off his performance and requires him to act rather than perform. They are different things. I'm niggling though.A big difference is that the stage shows were both one man monologues, albeit with AV back up, whereas he is graced with a supporting cast here, not least the miraculous performance by his stalker Martha who inhabits this sweet-as-sugar character with a dangerous she-devil interior that only raises its head when she's not getting her way, and her way would be to own and ravish Gadd.Gadd's second nemesis is the theatre impresario Darrien played impeccably by Tom Goodman-Hill who subjects Gadd to massive trauma and was the main antagonist in Monkey See Monkey Do.The combination of Darrien and Martha, and their collective trauma, create a stultifying inability for Gadd to do anything about his situation. His pathetic attempts at stand up comedy make any positive interest, from anyone, yes anyone, appealing at a subconscious level to Gadd and that may be why he rolls with the punches for so long against enemies that seem, to the viewer, so obviously easy to unlock himself from - but this is the way poor mental health and low self esteem can manifest themselves.Whilst most of us could easily disassociate ourselves with these two monsters Gadd simply cannot and finds himself descending into blacker and blacker territory.His only escape is through the fourth key character, the Mexican trans-actress Nava Mau, who plays Gadd's sort of girlfriend, although it's not easy. Gadd's sexuality is so confused that he simply doesn't know what he's looking for and it makes for a pretty challenging relationship.It's billed as a black comedy and there are comedic moments, and yes, Gadd, is a professional comedian. But don't come to this looking for laughs. It's a profound, original and true exploration of the stultifying impacts of poor mental health and it's performed with sensitivity and great skill.Surely the year will end up with this on all the top ten lists, in much the same way that ""I May Destroy You"" did.It's quite simply brilliant."
0	Firstly, the writing is all over the place and this is affecting the overall narrative which staggers and stumbles from one scene to the next.There is no pacing whatsoever, no flow to the story. It's as if somebody chopped semi-random parts from the book and filmed them.Not sure why some people are rating it so highly, I naturally realise that tastes differ but what is so appealing about this mess of an adaptation? For me at least there's just nothing to like. The acting is often weak, the casting for the main characters is mostly poor and why is everything so dull and gloomy? Of course, it was filmed in Canada ......Now compare and contrast to the 1980 miniseries - fantastic flow to the story, pretty much perfect casting and it also looks great, you can actually SEE the scenery, the buildings, the characters. AND it was all filmed in Japan.Of course, thanks to the power of the media this new adaptation will get a lot of accolades, but it really doesn't deserve them.I was looking forward to this but I'm extremely disappointed.
2	Stairs, a lot of stairs, more stairs. Just when you think the scenes involving stairs have concluded, and there's no possibility for more, another set appears. But this repetition makes sense as a beautiful metaphor for life's unfairness, the constant climbs and challenges, mirroring the central character's journey.'Ripley', at its core, features a social climber who is also a sociopath, a forger, a thief, and a murderer. This version of Patricia Highsmith's probably most famous character is darker than Matt Damon's portrayal in Anthony Minghella's 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' - more distant, calculating, and deliberate in pursuing what his social milieu denied him.His queerness is present, yet not as emphasized as in the 1999 film. The object of his obsession - the rich and slothful, utterly talentless Richard Greenleaf, aka Dickie - lacks the charms and attractiveness of young Jude Law's portrayal. This Dickie is merely another wealthy individual who crosses paths with Andrew Scott's Thomas Ripley, setting the stage for inevitable tragedy.The new Netflix series 'Ripley' offers a deep character study, staying truer to Highsmith's original material and vision than the eponymous film. It revels in slow pacing, meticulous attention to details and context. The characters are as crucial as the environments they navigate, the objects they covet, gift, or steal, making every element essential in this chilling narrative. Even Lucio, the Roman cat, becomes an unwitting accomplice in one of Ripley's elaborate crimes.The series' black-and-white aesthetic is as thick and luscious as molasses, adding layers of visual meaning. The clear inspiration from Caravaggio's dramatic chiaroscuro is aptly chosen, reflecting the blurred lines between criminality and artistry that Caravaggio himself embodied, which resonates deeply within the narrative. Who was Caravaggio? Who is Ripley? Can having a criminal mind also be a talent? Is there something inherently criminal in being an artist?Andrew Scott excels in portraying the emptiness within Ripley, akin to a black hole that swallows and crushes anything in its path.In a current landscape filled with mundane streaming content, 'Ripley' stands out as a gasp of fresh air, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in both the beauty and horror of this ever-elusive story.John Malkovich's cameo as a shady art dealer in the final episode set in Venice adds a sublime layer of self-referentiality within the Ripley universe. Malkovich, who portrayed an older version of Ripley in Liliana Cavani's 2002 film 'Ripley's Game', enriches the series with his presence, delighting both film lovers and Highsmith aficionados.Exquisitely diabolical.
0	"I'm no fan of either (or any) religion, but the facts of what happened at this time have been twisted so much out of shape it makes it a pro british protestant, arrogant affair.Throughout history the british have been known (like many other empire driven nations) to twist the facts to suit their own agendas, the problem with series like this, there are enough idiots who'll believe this to be the truth. The theme tune for this should be ""Rule Britannia"", It's so pro-british it's unwatchable for me, and has all the usual cliques. I stopped watching halfway through the 2nd episode, read other reviews, read historical facts (and it's extremely inaccurate as far as what actually happened is concerned, which is why he's changed the names of all the main protagonists!), no surprise this was written by an ex british military buffoon..."
0	Love the show and Nathan is a great actor but seems like the show is following Hollywood footsteps of getting in Politics and BLM, and defunding Police . That's too bad. I really like the show but I'm not going to watch anything that will include Political BS. I get enough of that from the news. Writers need to be a little bit more creative.
1	Before this season, I would have given this series a 10/10. For several years many fans gave their loyalty to watching this magnificent tv series only to have been so let down in the final season. Every episode of season 8 revealed the inability for these writers to continue to truly deliver the calibre of writing they gave the series to this point in keeping with the books. Unfortunately the writers have totally disenchanted fans to the point that they will not invest the time into any other series they put their pen to, especially any sort of spinoff they may contrive from the GOT series which is sad. I would have followed their work anywhere until this season of GOT aired which showed that they truly needed a book to follow so that they could simply write a script with the ideas already laid out before them. They have proved without a book, they were lost without any imagination as to how the series should end. The actors, and all other staff working on the series should be commended for producing some of the best tv in history as they did a superb job. Truly disappointed in the final season and left feeling like something was missing - yes, in fact there was, George R. R. Martin's book to guide them.
1	"Short review: The series are ok, but feels rushed, reduced to a bunch of characters that know each other and to (mostly) a single place on earth. Entertaining, good sci fi ideas, but feels otherwise shallow and small.Long version: Here, we got the trilogy of the scifi chinese novels ""The Three Body Problem"" as a foundation and core ideas of the plot. I read the back half a decade ago, so I had forgotten lots of it, and I saw the series almost as a newcomer to it.I won't spoil plot details, but it is well known the story deals with a future alien threat for humanity. That core idea, and most of the responses to it and the scifi concepts from the book are brought pretty well to the series. And they are done in an entertaining way. All good so far.Now, the problem of the series falls in other areas like the scale, the pace and the characters/casting. All of them, I get the feeling, from a lack of budget.Scale: Remember the magnitude and the feeling of ""epic"" scale scifi tv series like Battlestar Galactica or V ? Where everything was a stake? Where multiple characters from different parts wouldn't meet each other for seasons? That's lost here: 90% of the series happens in London/around London, and it is shot in a way that often feels more like a soap opera than a sci series. The same establishing shots all the time, mostly indoors, barely any extras, when outdoors just small streets. They might as well been shooting in a stage. The book involved a lot more travelling, things happening in parallel in US/Europe/China; giving us an adventure feeling and a bigger scale to it.Pace: most of other series are filled with stuff to drag them longer. This one isn't. But not in a good way that would make the show lean and smooth. In this case just feels like a lack of patience and budget to explain or show things, to know our characters, to let it grow on you: scenes are unconnected, characters jump from emotion to emotion without continuity, stuff just seem to happen. There isn't much character development, there isn't much tension, there isn't any mystery.Characters: truly the novels just had the 3-4 main charactera developed, while the secondary characters were more stereotypes without much deep. The tv series doesn't get much better. It mades things worse by making the main characters old classmates, and losing the more independent timelines and stories that would eventually cross each other in more epic shows.The story could've been slightly slower, with more emphasis on the characters and build the tension and mystery. Things, events and characters should've been given more distance, giving us more scale and variety/diversity of POV and environments. The only exception to this was the flashback storyline in the first 2 episodes, that feels a whole different level and was clearly done with care. Netflix, however, wasn't as confident on the IP's success and didn't made it was well as this could've been. I wonder if that will eventually mean its own demise. Sad. This one could've been great."
2	I think this is a very good series, during one episode you can feel so many different emotions. I think it's sad that so many characters from the original cast gets killed of or disapears from the show but that's understandable because of the timeline. The show extends like 10 or more years and life change a lot in a few years. I like the current cast as well. The series has so many seasons and everything can't always stay the same. Some people that dies makes the series more exiting and You feel so many different emotions
0	***Spoilers Included***Bit late to the party with this show, but where do I even start with it? Never in my life have I seen such an cripplingly depressing programme. It's just one horrible outcome after another between the patients and the lives of the characters. Even when you think a story arc might actually meet a pleasant conclusion, they somehow find a way snatch it away at the death ('death' being the operative word).While this might be presented as a medical drama, ultimately, it is nothing more than a big-budget soap opera. The goings on in the show are so ridiculously far-fetched that it's hard to believe that much of it could be considered as an accurate portrayal of life in a hospital emergency room. The characters are the most self- destructive people imaginable. They refuse to allow any positivity into their lives, and regularly sabotage their own happiness. They're all either sleeping with each other, falling out with each other, or sleeping with each other and then falling out with each other.The death toll in this show is also comical. Don't work at the hospital, you'll die. Don't get admitted to the hospital as a patient, you'll die. Don't even get involved with someone who has been anywhere near the hospital, you will probably die. They've killed off enough main characters to make Game of Thrones blush. There's been plane crashes, gun-toting maniacs, car accidents, and countless other occurrences that have seen a couple of predominant characters get bumped off every season on average (I've seen war films with a higher survival rate). The ones that are lucky enough to survive - at least in the short term - are treated to such joys as seeing loved ones die instead, getting divorced, or miscarrying (wonderful!)In closing - if you want to watch a show that will make you feel utterly horrible for 90%+ of the time you watch it, and has a cast of characters that are hell-bent on repeatedly destroying any chances they might have at happiness, then this is absolutely the show for you.
0	If you watch the tencent series there is little you cannot love. I wish more shows were done like that: faithful and sensible. If you read the books then the Chinese tv series is the thing you were looking for because it captures the detail, spirit and essence of the books. It that had come out of Hollywood it would have cost the namesake: ten cents to the dollar compared to this tripe! But, no! Hollywood says let's make it better by taking two people most famous for massacring the last four seasons of game of thrones which are widely acknowledged to be the most anticlimactic television ever. Why? Because the show runners had run out of book material so they decided to improvise. That's when you see the difference between real writers and wannabes.A good analogy for this show and Hollywood's general attitudes would be to throw money at the wall like talentless social media chefs and see if the spaghetti sticks. It's the trope checklist over quality: every single trope has one representative. One must ask the very basic and stupid question: why do you think you can write better dialogue then exceptional authors like GRR Martin and Liu Cixin? Result: a senseless series which deconstructs everything - dialogue, plot, and characters. Final result? A broken ming vase put together by a blind horse.
1	For a series with this hype, it's incredible to see some historical errors that any amateur historian could solve. 1 - The boats, whether Japanese, Dutch or Portuguese, are not those that appear in the series. 2 - Some costumes, particularly Western ones, don't either. 3 - But even more ridiculous is that we have an English sailor, on board a Dutch ship, who arrives in a small Japanese village where he meets a Japanese translator who only speaks Portuguese but who translates into English. The Portuguese are supposed to be the villains - forgeting the fact that in Japan they were just traders who almost never left the port - but not a word of their language is heard in the entire show or even any correct historic representation of them. Ridiculous. This is a show made for english speaking people with a disney like historical knowlege.
1	"For one thing, in a hospital, surgeons don't do rounding on patients, general doctors do. Surgeons consult the doctors patients. They remain detached from the patients so they can make difficult decisions related to care without emotion being a factor. They consult with the general physicians and nurses on the floor who do the bulk of labor of the hospital. Much of this is over the hospital computer network. Surgical staff have a massive case load and show up sparingly. Many times they don't even speak to the patients.There is no chief of surgery in most hospitals, they simply have surgical departments headed by doctors and a hospital board that consists of doctors. Patients are issued to surgeons by computer and the doctors on call send them cases for consultation. By the time you get to be a surgeon in a major hospital you are pretty much an institution, much bigger than any one hospital.On call rooms are rare, only prevalent in the emergency room areas and are there for the on call trauma doctors and surgeons. You won't find them much in upper floors. Surgeons have their own offices and staff and are rarely on site. Hospital floors are also broken up by purpose. There is a whole floor for surgical prep and if a person is getting scans, that is a whole floor is where he will be. The patient is moved, not the doctors. It isn't a hotel full of rooms with people coming to them.Finally, things in hospitals don't move as fast as this. They take time, drugs are scanned into charts from bar codes on the patient as well as the pharmacy inventory.They don't just grab a syringe out of a drawer and got to town. This would never happen. Nor would any major drugs or syringes be lying around in drawers. This is carefully inventoried by pharmaceutical staff.Charts have been on computer data bases since the mid 1990s with rolling computer carts. I'm not sure where this binder thing comes from.They don't have big rooms of supplies you can pillage. It's all dispensed by pharmacy code. Bar coded and assigned.Also, I love the characters and acting, but the situations and the patient reactions are stupid sometimes. Family members just don't react like this. They don't get upset with medical staff. Surgeons don't have so much pressure on them that they get traumatized by losses and go off to a trailer in the woods to sulk for days or need to have months of therapy to ""handle the pain."" The shows writing on that point is pure idiocy. It just doesn't happen.This show is a TV drama that is supposed to hold a line beyond mere ""soap opera"" standards. Yet this isn't the case. It sacrifices accuracy for direct conflict where there isn't any. It paints a picture of medicine that is also unreal. The speed of the prep for surgery is one thing. Surgery is in many cases a last ditch effort to save a life, this show throws surgery around like it's a trip to the market. Not the case. Prep can take days, emergent surgery is rare. Most surgeons won't ever see one unless it's part of a major trauma and most of those don't survive. They are slow and methodical and deliberate in everything they do.In all, I think a person having watched this show and then being in an actual hospital for even a short period would find this show inaccurate to an embarrassing amount. I honestly don't know how these writers have gotten away with this for almost 20 years. On the other hand the characters are well developed and lovable. It's a character drama more than a medical one. Which is why I gave it such a high score. They do have the ability to grab you and if you can tolerate the sometimes stupid writing then you're good."
1	Does anyone else find him almost impossible to watch? Why is he channeling Dustin Hoffman in Hook, it's distractingly bad and I'm only halfway through episode 1.... I am keeping an open mind for the rest of the series but I really have to say, this guy was so poorly cast for this role. If all the white male actors in Hollywood.Despite this one painfully distracting stubbed toe of a flaw, the rest of the casting is fantastic and it's clearly a good looking series. Well shot, cinematography is on point. The Portuguese turned to English is kind of annoying in this day and age but oh well. Can't have it all.
1	Was a really good show then season 8 happened.If you exclude season 8 then this show was clever, intriguing and really well written.But season 8 does ruin the rewatch value when the ending is so badly done.Wish my watch had ended before the end. :(
2	I love Nathan Fillion. Firefly is simply awesome, Castle was pretty enjoyable too. But The Rookie is a disappointment. Three episodes into the first season, I see no depth -- about anything. The police cases are universally shallow, not one of them had any intrigue or surprise. The larger narrative arc (middle-aged man joins police force) simply follows preconceptions and stereotypes. The personal relationships have not added to quality story-telling either. Much of it feels action-crammed and rushed. As of today (14 Nov 2018), the show has a rating of 8.0 -- which either vastly overvalues what I have seen or represents highly optimistic hopes for future potential. At this stage, the show is boring and meh. Someone as talented as Nathan deserves far better material, and so does the audience. Rating it 6/10 is pushing it.UPDATE 12/2018: Took a while, but as of episode 7 the quality improved considerably. No more shallow rookie hazing, finally some character depth. People you can and want to relate to. But episode 8 really got it rolling. Interesting perspective on what the job does to you, nicely done. I hope the writers keep giving the cast that kind of material, they must love the opportunity to apply their skills and talent. If this quality is permanent, it's a winner. Upping my rating to 8/10.
1	"As someone who has spent countless hours across all the Fallout games, I was very nervous when they announced this project. Videogame adaptations tend to be extremely disrespectful to their source material and try to do their own thing which, almost all of the time, turns out for the worse. So I am very thankful that the Fallout show carefully crafts its original narrative with proper admiration for the source material. Being canon does hurt the overall lore, and depending on how much you liked the stuff it poorly handles, you might loathe the show.The show opens with Cooper Howard, with this one short scene done right before the bombs fell and destroyed the world, it's a very effective scene that gets you invested early on. Right after that they have a short scene introducing Lucy which is a nod to all the skills of the series. A bit after that, they show different vault dwellers interacting, I won't disclose much here as these interactions show how different the residents of every vault can be, which is another thing nicely adapted from the games. I do find the marriage subplot of the opening to be a bit too cringe-worthy for my taste, but hey it is something that feels straight out of Fallout 2. Lastly, they introduce the brotherhood character of the show, Maximus, and they do a really good job with him as well. I think fans of Fallout 1, 2, and 3 would really dig Lucy as the lead. I, myself do find her good but her ""romantic"" side only comes across as cringey to me, plus as much as they try to make her a multi-dimensional character, she remains very plain throughout the story.The production quality always looked immaculate, I was just nervous that they would mess up the narrative, and my concerns only got bigger when we found out that the show was going to be canon to the games. The casting is well done and plenty of the characters, just like the sets in the show, ooze that good old fallout feel; the visuals are the stars of the show for me, It just looks completely immersive and top-notch, they have so many tiny details right, it's unbelievable at times that such care was put into it and, once again, it is, by far, the best aspect of the show.Naturally, the show can't put every single great thing about Fallout in one season but it does a decent enough job and treats the source material with utmost respect while telling its own story in this universe. Once again, I just wish they didn't mishandle what they did, as these are some of the most essential aspects of the games. This show has plenty of potential, so, I hope this keeps improving as we get more and more seasons.Furthermore, the story has some clear pacing issues, and the characters aren't that great either, but it all ends very fittingly and if they can straighten these few sore bumps then we might have an incredible show on our hands by season 2. How it all comes together in the end is quite well done, I wish it happened sooner though, as for most of the show there is no captivating main driving force, the initial ones only work for the first 4 episodes. The writers could've just had Lucy meet some more intriguing characters throughout her journey this could've fleshed out her character far more and kept the overall show far more engaging than it is.Moreover, I believe people will like all three leads, Lucy is a good character who serves as a decent character for the slow introduction of the series to those who have never touched a Fallout game. The Ghoul, Cooper Howard, is a very morally corrupt character who leads most of the action sequences of the show. The Brotherhood newbie, Maximus is also a very likable addition; weirdly enough, to me, he comes across as Finn from Star Wars but is better written. This will bring in so many new fans and I am very much looking forward to their impressions on the games."
2	This was the most intriguing tv series for 2024! Didn't watch original one or read book but can say it depicts the discipline/bushido code accurately . The natural disaster like earthquake has been shown too . Was fan of GOT for political tension , trickery but Shogun is going to replacing that since it looks real and some of the plots matches with history. Hiroyuki Sanada is excellent as usual like he performed in Westworld .And Cosmo Jarvis gets my attention , I am going to watch his other works too. Anna Sawai is delivering very good acting . Thank you Team Shogun for excellent entertainment!
2	It's hard to think of many TV miniseries that are as accomplished and skilfully executed as Ripley. The pleasures in watching this were so intense we watched the first six hours back to back and would have kept going if the hour hadn't been so late.The first thing to strike the viewer is the exceptional cinematography and lighting, that equal the work of Sven Nykvist and similar masters. The choice of black and white prevents the Italian seaside locales from evoking holiday memories and instead underscore the menace and threat that ripple through proceedings like a deadly undercurrent. As the frailties of the human protagonists become ever more exposed, the mute faces of classical sculptures look on with icy detachment. Shadows recur against walls in finest film noir style, while endless staircases snake across the screen like the complicated web of lies issuing from the resourceful but pitiless Ripley.And speaking of the man himself, Andrew Scott inhabits the character so effortlessly and convincingly that one forgets this is a performance; Scott IS Ripley. Every facial expression, gesture and line of dialogue is delivered with absolute perfection, showing both the emotional intelligence and psychological insight that Scott brings to the roleThe only reservation I have about the film centers on unconvincing plot points that can most likely be laid at the feet of the source material. A sampling:1. A sophisticated con artist like Ripley is unlikely to think that the rich and entitled Dickie Greenleaf would look favourably on the opportunity to smuggle a suitcase of contraband for a local Mafioso;2. It strains credibility that after Ripley reveals himself to be a manipulative and shady character, Dickie would turn down Ripley's offer to move out of Dickie's villa fairly early in the proceedings. Why on earth would Dickie want this interloper of dubious morality to stay?3. When Marge calls Rome to speak to Dickey after Dickey has disappeared, Ripley passes himself off as Dickie on the phone, even though he speaks in his normal speaking voice, which sounds nothing like Dickie;4. It seems unlikely that with the numerous letters Ripley writes to Marge and Dickie's parents pretending to be Dickie, no one notices any difference in the writing style or vocabulary used that would sound unnatural or different from Dickie's normal way of expressing himself.There are a few other similar issues with the plotting, but despite these lapses, one's enjoyment of the series is barely dented. For anyone who appreciates film noir, top flight acting or brilliant cinematography, Ripley is truly must-see viewing.
1	I love Nathan Fillion, and this show did not disappoint. Until the Bailey character was introduced. Dewan is awful, the character is unprofessional and incompetent. And the relationship between Nolan and Bailey comes off as forced and fake. It's almost unwatchable now.Aside from Dewan, the cast is great. Grey is my favourite, a well rounded character. Bradford, Lopez and even Harper, are all fun to watch. The introduction of Aaron was a great boost. Nolan's rookie, Celina, doesn't add much to the show.Hopefully they can get the show back on track in season 6, bring it back to what it was in the first 3 seasons. Fingers crossed.
2	The story was quite well known but I was really got shocked by the first 5 mins in the 1st episode. It really showed how people were cold blood in the culture revolution between 1960s and 1970s. I used to watch a lot of movie about that period but none of them could show the badness of these leaders and the madness of the majority people.Moreover, the way of presenting the game about resolving 3 body world's issue is very cool and clear. It was hard for me to understand it when I read the book. Even I understood it later, I did not think it could be presented as much fun as this tv show doing.It is really worth to watch. Great work.
2	"At the beginning, I didn't want to watch this show. I thought it was a second ""ER"" and was not so original. But an evening I had time and I said to myself ""Why not watching ""Grey's Anatomy"" just to see how it is ?"". So I watched it and... I liked it !Actually, it's not a remake of ""ER"". I don't really know how to explain that but it's very different from the successful show of 1994 (that I like very much too). Each character is very endearing, especially George O'Malley (T.R. Knight). And Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) is so beautiful, her smile is so lovely... They aren't heroes but just people like you and me who try to be surgeons and to have a good personal life. And it's not always easy...This series is at the same time funny, sad, moving and thrilling. So, a great one !"
0	"You ever have someone act more dramatic than a situation requires to try and emphasize their self-imposed seriousness?Example: Director: ""you're a beat cop, someone just broke the law, tell them that's not okay""Cop: ""Not only was that bad, but that was also wrong and now everyone doesn't like you.""Director: ""Perfect""The show tries to be gritty and serious because it has gunfights and drugs use, but it's basically Gray's Anatomy with a badge. It's a poor attempt at warming peoples perception of the LAPD, and they won't hesitate to make some BS political points from time to time.From the gun buyback programs that are executed like a commercial for Best Buy customer service, to the govt. subsidies available for struggling black mothers that every beat cop knows all about and is willing to help.This show is garbage."
1	Seasons 1-6 are the most phenomenal television I have ever seen, and I will continue to say this is my favorite show. The cast, cinematography, and writing (to be continued) is incredible. These factors leave you greatly invested in the storyline so much that the last two seasons are really a knife to the heart. So much beautiful set up is betrayed by sloppy writing, rushed plots, and corny outcomes: things you would never expect to see in a show of this impecability. However, with the absolute trash writing that comes with season 7 and 8, the cast never loses their touch. One can truly see what a talented bunch of actors are present in this show when they must completely switch their characters without much room for transition. With the boring dialogue and cheesy scenes, these actors maintain their dignity and great work. This show was always ten stars for me but this final season, especially, led me to remove 4 stars and that is being extremely generous. It feels as if all this investment, all the prophecies, all the preparation present in this show was wasted on that ending. The final episode tried so hard to create a twist that it made little sense and tied no loose ends. The only character development and storyline that followed through was Sansa's and that is probably the only part of this season that kept me watching. Very disappointed in how the writers spent so much time delivering a perfect nearly complete gift only to put a silly little bow on top of it before it was even packaged properly.
2	If you haven't already. Watch the first episode. The production value alone will get you hooked.So many stories to follow. So many characters to love and to hate and to root for or boo at.It's been a while since I've watched something from the fresh start of its inception, and had to wait a week for the next episode. The wait is always worth it. Its shocking, its funny, it's sad and courageous. The team of writers are on point at keeping you guessing what's going to happen!? Who is that!? What are they going to do!?The cinematography and sets/visuals are beautifully stunning. They have captured a real and wild Japan both in the cities and the countryside, the towns, the buildings, the savagery and the beauty. At times it can be brutally harsh then in an instant vulnerable and soft.If you don't like subtitles at least give it a try. Mainly spoken of Japanese, there are moments of English, though in reality they are supposed to be speaking Portuguese.Disney. You've finally done something good. But I think it was actually FX.
0	The first 2 seasons were great. Now they have gone political. Can't they just do entertainment instead of the crap they are trying for this season? Lost a loyal viewer.
0	Disclosure: I know nothing about the game, nor do I care about the game. I watched this with no clue and no expectations.So, obviously its for teens. Gamers? Viewers who like robot-ey things and senseless violence. Im not offended or grossed out, its just all kind of silly.This reminded me alot of 1995's Tank Girl, but longer, slower, and more dramatic. None in a good way (not saying that Lori Petty movie was great, but it was quick and fun for what it was) This is not a good show. It jumps around between groups, environments, slowly tries to bring in a plot....maybe. The underground, bunkered people are afraid to go to the surface...where people seem to be living just fine? Huh?I guess its just not interesting enough for me to continue past the first couple of episodes.2 stars instead of 1 for the cool sci-fi angle.
2	Ok, let me be clear: I'm not comparing actors, cinematography, script etc. That would be impossible and foolish. But when it comes to the overall impression, evaluation, feeling that I was left with after watching Ripley, I can subjectively say that only 'Dexter' is in the same league.Words that pop into mind include art, pure, contrast, smile, dark, sophistication, psychology, perspective, tension, romance, charm, obsession, beauty, captivating, to name but a few.So over the years this is only the second time I've experienced this. I hope there will be a third. When it happens, I'll let you know.
0	I was looking forward to this show since it came out and all was well, I was enjoying it, but when I watched episode 6... Todd Howard has used his connections to basically do the adult version of destroying a lego set because he didn't get to be the one to build it. If you're a fan of 1, 2, or New Vegas do not watch this show because they will piss on you and not even have the grace to call it rain. They destroyed the NCR, in fact, making it so the NCR was destroyed PRE New Vegas, therefore nullifying it. This is such an adult temper tantrum. This was made out of anger and spite that Obsidian made a better game and it shows.Good actors though. Sorry that good acting can't save bad writing.
1	The woke agenda people destroyed a serie once again. Season 3 has put my favorite serie in the ground. And if you look at all the comments that are comming out... i see i'm not alone.
2	"Before you write this off as some hater, know that I'm a person of color. I appreciate the attempt at bringing real life issues into the show, but that does not forgive bad writing or a shove-it-down-your-throat attitude. Season 3 has so far been only about 2 things. Women suffering from men and people of color suffering from bad cops. There's no longer policing, there's no longer ""The Rookie"". This is another show, and it's the wrong show.This used to be a goody-two-shoes comic relief police show with just enough drama to make us invested. That doesn't go with this. If you want to talk about these issues that deeply then make another show dedicated to them.And if you wanted to simply give them an appearance in ""The Rookie"", then you could have done it more subtly and without simply pulling us out of the story and environment we were used to. For example, Officer Smitty would have been a good character to involve in the racism issues. He's a slacker, comic-relief, but what if we show him when he feels endangered, because of a person of color who doesn't show any cause for danger? That could have been a good tip of the hat towards the issue, and showing it through a character we're familiar with.One other thing is the death of logic in this third season.SPOILERS IN THE NEXT LINE. (Check below for Spoiler end and start reading there to avoid season 3 spoilers)The fact that Jackson's TO would be this stupid when he has the IA commander's son as a boot just doesn't make sense. And if he's as smart and cautious about his racism as they make him out to be, he'd have actually acted like a goody-two-shoes in front of Jackson, which the latter could have noticed and created another plotline about that, but we're past that now.SPOILER END.At the moment, I'm conflicted about even finish season 3, I'm at episode 5, and frankly I don't want to watch it. I just want this whole mess over with and for us to get back to the story of The Rookie."
1	A good show - good casting, good acting, nice decors, but very, very rushed. In just 4 episodes they cover half of the books, and don't really show how the main character experiences the cultural shock and how he comes to change his views of Japan's culture, and how he comes to understand and accept the culture and customs, it's people and how he adapts to his new life in Japan.If you haven't read the books, you'll probably be thrilled by the show. But if you have read the books - you might be disappointed by how rushed it is the show.I'm giving it a 7.5 (though I'm rounding it down to compensate for all the 10 - who are exaggerated).
0	Started off with potential The first few episodes showed promise then it quickly devolved into a mid-evil soap opera.The portrayel of the characters was beyond antiseptic. Too many flashbacks, flash forwards, flash sideways. These were used as time fillers which served no purpose.Minimal exposition would have served just as well. Characters, let's do this, let's do that. No denied, no can't do that, do this instead because plot says so. And let's talk about it for several episodes. This rambling is similar to the dialog. Let's do this because of that and then watch what happens because that's what is suppose to happen.
0	This show started out strong. Then the final season happened... The writers clearly had no idea about the characters or the lore of their own show. EVERYTHING has been great about this show except for the terrible final season. Its nobody's fault but the writers: they underestimated the intelligence of the viewers in a way that's simply insulting and they clearly just wanted to end what should have been an epic tale. What was the point of watching the previous 7 seasons if this is where it leads? Don't waste your time.
0	What a shame. I like Nathan Fillion. The premise of his story was great. They started to lose that in season two. But omg- season three is awful beyond words. I watched 3 episodes and was appalled. I am out for good. Dreadful.Go phony woke and go broke people.
0	Grey's Anatomy is a mediocre show. No single aspect of it is notably terrible, but nothing is notably amazing either. The acting is generally tolerable, sometimes even good, and cinematography is serviceable considering the time period of initial seasons, but that's where the positives end. Most characters feel very shallowly developed. Dialogue often feels too artificial. The longer term story is all over the place, with characters making arbitrary choices not suiting their personality simply to stir up drama when the show gets slow. I can safely say after watching 6 seasons and reading the abysmal reviews of newer ones, it's not worth watching besides as background noise.
0	I have never played the game, and so come to it with no expectations, but reviewing this as a stand-alone show I am quite unimpressed. The story is a pretty run of the mill post nuclear apocalypse yarn about feral humans trapped on the surface and privileged people dwelling in underground bunkers until things go wrong and they are forced to interact.The storyline is silly, some of the scenes comedic for no discernible reason, the pacing is dreadfully slow and the characters unengaging. Two episodes in I simply find myself uninterested in continuing to be bored by this.Perhaps, were I an aficionado of the game, I would enjoy it more and be looking forward to future storylines but I'm not, so I can't, and the production does not have enough going for it to make me continue with it.
2	What a terrific adaptation this is. Classic anti- hero Tom Ripley, the creation of author Patricia Highsmith, is a survivor, a conman and sociopath.Brilliantly played by Andrew Scott, who exudes a quiet menace, with a minimum amount of effort.Tom's small cons in New York aren't going well, so he descides to take a commission to go to Italy, to persuade Dickie Greenleaf a casual acquaintance to come back to his family in America. As soon as he arrives, he see's an opportunity to live comfortably at Dickie's expense, much to the consternation of his girlfriend Marge, Dakota Fanning. Beaufully shot in stylish black and white, which brings out the 50s feel in spades. This is a first class version of a classic tale. Mr Ripley is indeed talented and so is everyone involved in this prodution.
0	With the acting as flat like this I could hardly believe this was created by the same people that created Game of Thrones.. Was it really?I can see why people that read the book say it's far more better than the series. I guess it should be.I watched this series with some enjoyment, but it did not encourage me to go read the book.That was in fact all I wanted to say about 3 Body Problem... but I still need 186 characters.... Well then... if I must... I think this is a mediocre SF series, with a lot of plotholes and characters that do not really come to life. Something to watch if you cannot find anything else to watch.
1	"Had the original books for over 8 years but have been procrastinating to read it forever, the show made me finally started to read the books, because the adopted story is 0 award winning material... ""God"" worshipping cult, check. (Also doesn't make sense for a top scientist that holds her scientific beliefs over her life, given up on humanity as she's disappointed in her own species, end up building this ""God"" worshipping cult. Having ""Our Lord"" in her mouth so many times just doesn't fit the character) Confess love before dying and the other person realize they love the dead person the whole time and it's too late for them to be together, check. (Slowing down the whole pace of the show to add a clichest unnecessarily love story just to have more romance lines make perfect sense) Sudden diagnosis of incurable cancer and rich friend shouting they have all the money in the world to save the person, check. (Netflix just can't have one show without showing rich lifestyles in the most superficial way possible)"
2	I was sceptical at first but I really enjoyed this TV show. Black/white footage and italian language make it pleasant to watch. Even though there might only be two very tense scenes I never felt bored while watching. The only thing that bothers me is that Marge seems to be a bit dumb: When Tom introduces himself to her very early in the show, he mentions that his parents drowned in a boating accident. But when he talks to her in the last episode he mentions that they died in a car accident. She should have instantly realized that he is a liar and not to be trusted. Other than this I really enjoyed the show! 9/10.
2	I enjoyed my time with the series. It's not as complex as the books (and the science is very shallow in comparison) but it's not nearly as bad as some have made it out to be.Bernard Wong is a great Da Shi, Liam Cunningham inhabits Wade well, and, knowing where their story goes, I did enjoy the relationship between Jin and Will. The other characters are all fair enough versions or amalgamations of various ones in the books, but I have to admit that I simply didn't like the Auggie character at all - her constant moping and nae-saying brought little to the table and I ended up just finding her annoying.I'll stick with the series (if Netflix does!), and look forward to seeing how they handle the vast change in scope as the story progresses.Overall things are off to a good start - it could go either way, but it's a long way from the 1/10 that some of the more reactionary reviewers have judged it!
0	Too much sickening LGBT activism. But the show ,especialy first eleven seasons is,in general well written, some episodes being brilliant but also some with strange development, such as Miranda admitted to the hospital council instead of Karev who owned the shares of Dr. Yang (15 million USD) .
0	After watching characters develop for 7 years it was a tragity to see season 8 treat the characters with so little respect for character development in favour of fire and explosions.
0	The series starts with a impactful scene from the Chinese cultural revolution where people are murdered for believing in science and the truth, and not complying with their social revolution.Almost unbelievably, Netflix then switches to a scene where they show how they, themselves, are perpetrating the modern version of this.Within the first couple of minutes you'll meet the genius leading black character working overtime and the two genius female leads, one Asian and one gorgeous white woman. All the classics. Then add the white male doofus trying to talk to them but who is of course rejected, looked down upon and is just pathetic. This story unfortunately just continues.A society based not on the truth, not on the scientific method, but their misled, brainwashed beliefs, is a society that is destined to implode. The irony stinks, but the fact that people don't even see it, is dangerous.
0	Had potential and had a great diasatopian vibe at start but wooden acting, very poor sfx and ridiculous storyline. Utter load of gibberish written by a 10 year old with a vivid imagination. Don't waste my time.They add the odd bit of ultra violence for dramatic effect but it fails for deliver. The characters are non relatable and I care for non of them. Loads of critical stuff not explained and incoherent. Stick to the games as this adaptation is a waste of time to watch.Got to episode 3 and gave up as it was painful to watch. Some weird 200 year old zombie with no nose who doesn't seem to get hurt. Crappy metal space marines who are dicks. Some innocent girl who's lived in a tin for her life who suddenly is Bear Grylls. Just weird, tacky and poorly executed. Avoid.
1	"I share the notion with some other reviews, that this show is a bit uneven. I have not read the book, but the 1st episode hooked me good. Good pacing, good mystery, good science-fiction, feeling of something big and important going on. Just perfect. But soon other aspects of the show started appearing, and it became... Not bad, but probably not as good.It, actually, kind of reminds me of Dune, and what made Dune so difficult to adapt to screen, with politics being the main problem. There are quite a lot of politics here. They do make total sense in the context of the show, especially as more information is revealed later on, but they can still be a bit boring. And sometimes on the nose.Another problem is that I just don't believe these characters are scientists. Especially, when a cult comes into play (let me phrase it this way to avoid spoilers). I may entertain the idea, that they are smart, but that they are scientists? I don't know, they do not match the pattern that I've seen among a few real scientists, that I've known during my higher education. In fact, I would say that it is difficult for me to buy whatever occupation is for most of the characters in the show, besides, maybe the teacher guy. They do not feel ""human"" enough, I guess.Nevertheless, this was overall a good watch for me. Can't say I will recommend it to everyone, but I can definitely recommend trying it, while keeping in mind, that this is partially like a prologue, based on certain things happening in the end. I expect, that things can get closer to what was happening during 1st episode."
1	The plot is really good, the first 3 episodes very good and very accurate. Great series....but, where is the Portuguese language?The japanese people speaks their own language but when a Portuguese translator is needed the characters speaks in English.The directors should be more careful with this, and this issue is enough to put me off with the series and downgrade this much my rate instead of a 10 if they speak the correct language, it's really annoying specially for a Portuguese speaker waiting for my own language and then...english. Really disappointed.If there will be second season the producers should rethink about this.
2	But season 15 has really let me down. They need to bring back some of the characters which they haven't killed off.
2	"Within the first episode you can tell the quality of the production is excellent. Incredible sets and props combine with a well written story line, supported by a very talented cast, for a visual feast that does not fail to entertain. Ella Purnell is perfectly cast as 'Lucy' and brings a solid performance to the role. Walter Goggins is a gifted actor and fulfills the role of 'The Ghoul' with his own personal flair. The supporting cast has a wide scope of talent with a long list of quality credits to their names.Overall, I found this to be a show that is well written, well produced, and well cast. It stands in a class with series like ""See"", ""Silo"", ""Into the Badlands"" and ""The Last of Us"".Even if this genre isn't typically on your list, I highly recommend giving 'Fallout' a view. The story presentation itself warrants a watch and the visuals are (sorry for the cliché) a true feast for the eyes.👍 👍"
0	Watching the first few episodes I had hopes of this being a worthwhile series to watch. Ultimately, I found this to be comparable to the route Game of Thrones took, excellent to start with and then falls apart at the end.Instead of continuing with the exciting story line laid out in the beginning it diverted off into seeming like it was trying to do over the top character development with only a few episodes left. That got me to wondering how are they going to finish this story with all the digging into characters lives that was going on.The final few episodes were soft and disappointing... to the point that I felt like I had wasted my time.
2	Season 1 - 9/10 Season 2 - 9.5/10 Season 3 - 9.5/10 Season 4 - 9/10Season 5 - 7/10 Season 6 - 6.5/10Season 7 - 3/10 Season 8 - 2/10The show clearly falls off in quality as soon as they run out of books (season 1-4 were almost direct adaptation from the books, seasons 5-6 were a bit of a mix and book material ending, season 7-8 were written by the producers)It's a fantastic show with multiple plot storylines and you WILL get drawn to at least 2-3 characters and want to see what happens. As long as you know the show/story will fall off a cliff and change completely once the book material runs out, you will have a great viewing, if you are expecting the same quality start to finish, you will be angry/upset/disappointed.The dialogue, writing, plot points, pacing, character assassinations/dumbed down, plot armour, no more strategic politics, everything really just becomes dumbed down once the producers take over. Up until that, it's like a more mature, well-written, twisted dark medieval show with a bit of fantasy.
2	"To get the obvious thing out of the way first, the casting makes no sense. I spent the first few episodes trying to work out if Tom and Dickie are meant to be 40-somethings in this version, with Dickie having a much younger girlfriend, or whether the viewer is supposed to accept that these 40-something actors are in their mid-20s. The answer? They're meant to be ""30s"" someone eventually says. And Freddie Miles is played by a female non-binary actor, which means that he reads half the time as a woman and the other half as a 15-year-old boy.But... once you get over that, this is very enjoyable! It's so beautifully shot, in an expressionist style, that it makes you aware of how by-numbers the blocking and camera angles are in most modern dramas. Andrew Scott is mesmerising, of course (although, since he plays Tom as a really creepy, reptilian weirdo, it's hard to understand why Dickie becomes his friend). The use of music, sound effects and silence really heightened the atmosphere. The 'will they catch him or won't they' ramps up until it gets properly tense. The inspector is brilliant.I enjoyed this series more with each episode, and found myself wishing there were more episodes to watch. I would like to see a similar adaptation of other books in the series - with Andrew Scott, but perhaps with slightly less weird casting otherwise."
0	After watching the show in its entirety and the first and second episode one more time for good measure I am certain that the show is not about fallout or its inhabitants.From the beginning, the show ignores one of the core principle of the universe: radioactivity. Radioactivity is the number one thing that the vaults are built to protect its inhabitant against (although vault tech also did some pretty nasty experiments, but this is besides the point), to the point where each and every adult vault dweller is provided with a device that constantly monitor the environment. In this show, it's merely a macguffin.The ending of the show is also a macguffin without resolution: Vault 31-33 remains under VT's control, the BoS gets control of the macguffin, the next macguffin is in NV where the Ghoul and Dog Meat are headed and Lucy tags along because she has nothing better to do.The fallout universe is merely a backdrop, that's why it's paradoxically largely ignored.
1	Interesting character stories with episodes that keep you entertainedsoundtrack not so much
2	Over all a good TV police series. I like the cast and writing that shows the perspective from a 40 something rookie (Nathan Fillion). The rookie policeman has the wisdom of real life experiences that add to the job. I would recommend this TV friendly police drama.
1	This TV show hit me hard after the pilot episode. Great effects, perfect atmosphere, beautiful scenery, perfect casting on japanese's part - everything was working out. Same with the second episode, and a bit weaker with the third. And that's it. The series should have ended there, or just fricking utilize the potential it had. But it didn't. I felt tricked as the episodes went on, as they are making you to believe some perfect storm is coming to brace yourself for action. But it doesn't!!! And it makes you feel tricked. Instead, you are getting more and more inconclusive dialogue that seems to lead nowhere. And it DOES lead nowhere. Or at least they are saving the efforts for the final episode. I would like my time invested here back, thank you very much!
2	Watch it 'till season 7 finale, and -for the love of god- just stop there, use your imagination to end the story, picture whatever you want, but just DO NOT watch season 8, it is a dark place from which you will never come back. Dark. Dark place. They ruined E.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G.
2	The series is quite entertaining and although it has its flows I am glad that Netflix has finally released something space/apocalypse related. There is a noticable lack of those themes in the past few years and I am not sure why. Maybe CGI is too expensive?When it comes to 3 Body Problem series, the acting is good, the plot is original and the camera work is professional. 6th and 7th episode of the 1st season feel like fillers though. Even though a director or writer probably wanted them for character building, interpersonal relationships and for us to start caring more about certain characters, they could have been much shorter. They mess up with the flow and pace.Nevertheless, I am happy this series is made and I am eagerly awaiting more episodes to be released. If you are a fan of space / apocalypse themes, you should definitely watch it.
2	In Episode 05, Sophon tells Wade and Jin Cheng, that San-Ti's planet is unstable so they don't have much time to improve their technology compared to Earth.That is not necessarily true because human civilization also faces the same hurdles as the San-Ti in the form of Ice Age. Holocene, the interglacial period we're in, happens to be longer than the previous ones, giving us much time to improve our technology from farming, to industrial revolution, to atomic bomb, to computer and information age.The big difference is that we achieve all that in one go, uninterrupted. So, instead of demeaning and calling us bugs, the San-Ti should worship us as gods. Flawless, but divine nonetheless.Anyways, for all of it flaws, 3 Body Problem breathes a fresh air to sci-fi genre, which for too long has defied the laws of physics -- for instance, people travelling at the speed of light don't seem to be affected by time dilation, and come back to find there loved ones the same age as when they left them (what kinda bulltit is that?).
0	I watched the first four episodes hoping it would get better, but finally had to call it. While the cinematography was beautiful, I had a hard time feeling any pull to keep watching. The series is drab, moves at a snail's pace and did little to keep my interest as the plot lines were dragged out well beyond what was required. This should have stayed a movie as those behind the series have not found a way to create an engaging bridge between the more interesting moments of the series. It was almost as if the series flat lined for most of the air time, with a few flashes of life intended to keep viewers engaged. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough for me!
2	Let's say you're reading these reviews and haven't watched GoT yet, but now that it's finished are considering the marathon. What's the consensus? In this case, the consensus is accurate, and that is:Seasons 1-6: outstanding. Deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy of Hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. GoT is worth watching for these seasons, definitely.Season 7: you suddenly notice the writing and plotting has taken a sharp dive downwards in quality. There are inexplicable ideas, inconsistent characterisation and soap-opera dramas. But at least the entertainment value is still very high, so it gets a pass.Season 8: this drop chasms down to depths you didn't think possible. The writing has got so amateurish that the still-fantastic production values are no longer enough to save it. If you ever enjoyed Lost but were amazed at how bad the final season was, you're in familiar territory here.The biggest problem with the final season was it took us out of the story and got us thinking about its many weaknesses. We lost our suspension of disbelief. Fatal for fiction. It also ruined the series-arcs to the point where a rewatch of the entire series is pointless.So can I recommend a GoT marathon for newcomers? Yes, the first 6 seasons are worth the disappointments later on. But best series of all time it is not. It could've been, but dropping the ball in the final stretch puts it behind the following superior series more worthy of your marathon:Battlestar Galactica (2003-2008)Twin Peaks (all 3 seasons, plus the movie)Breaking Bad
0	I only watched The Rookie this long as I really liked Castle. But now it's all about a Peyton Place poor relationships and not a police show. I hoped it would change and get back to how season 1 and 3 were. It sucks now and I won't be watching it anymore. Nathan Fillion was very entertaining in Castle and I think that's what brought us all to watch The Rookie. It's very boring of late but at least I can go back and watch re-runs of Castle. What a let-down, this used to be fun to watch. It's as if we are now watching reality TV. It really ended after season 2. A lot of cop shows were cancelled due to the current political climate around policing and it feels like The Rookie only escaped its fate because they made some kind of deal to transform their entertaining little show into a platform for the issue.
1	"I have been watching this since the very beginning of it. It has started amazingly and was very well paced and produced. A whole big amazing Real but Fantasy world with interesting characters all have different story lines and still connected masterfully.I have to admit that I was amazed and found myself unable to stop watching it. I wen through and were looking for any material related to it so I found the books. A song of ice and fire. what a great universe. what a magnificent writing and what a brutal yet interesting story telling. I found myself dedicated to the story and faster than any book before, I have done reading them. then again and again I re-watched the show and tried to dig down the theories, prophecies, build ups and characters arcs. What a great journey! I have to admit that it was great. Reading about the blue rose in the wall and finding the true meaning beyond the ice and fire was especially a magnificent experience. Thanks a lot both for the creator of the show and The author George Raymond Richard Martin.That was the first part, until The books stopped because for any reason the author didn't finished them and the end of season 4 on the TV and some parts of the rest until the end of season 6. beyond that, the show has started to fall down and got worse and worse through time. no complex story line links, no character development, no mind-blowing twists, no deep dialogues and finally it converted to a whole new thing. something that was not like what I have loved once. It became a disaster in season 8 in fact. what an unfortunate, what a waste.I gave the show 10/10 stars and despite some bad writings and bad episodes haven't had a second thought about changing it ever before until now. It is with great sorrow only now where I am going to change my vote for the whole TV Show and give it a fair one considering season 7 and season 8. and considering that, it is definitely way lower than a 10/10. this is a beater end for me and Game of thrones. I wont watch it again because it is both ridiculous and painful (for example anytime someone says ""winter is coming"") and I wont be reading the books neither because Ive been informed that Author has been saying :the shows path is not much difference from the books"". Also I wont be watching anything relating to this universe ever unless I hear otherwise about the way the books will handle the story.So If you haven't watched this show yet, be careful to not get involved very deep and not be deceived by the greatness of first 4 chapters or you will be disappointed in the most horrible way possible."
0	"Cheesy dialogues, hysterical outbreaks, relationships approached from a perspective of a 22 year old girl, naive ""love conquers all"" and philosophy quotes as if they came from a teenager. Had to stop it in the middle of season 2. (Should have known what was coming when gray was asked what the best 80s band was and when the name twisted sister came up she expressed discomfort. True to this spirit..if you play mariah carey albums when youre alone you ll like the show. Otherwise just dont waste your time. Actually, in the first case start therapy and come down to earth). I wonder why this thing has become so succesfull, political correctness nowadays prevents me from saying anything more.."
0	"The show is beyond ridiculous. I love Nathan, but this is an absolute travesty. I actually became a cop in my forties and it was nothing like this. I feel like I was cheated. It's not just the technical aspects of the show that are hung, it's the forced ""acting"" inbounding series of cliches that the viewers assaulted with every few minutes."
1	...but overall (working in the health profession myself) I can tell you this is a very unrealistic show. The dialogue is irritating and the medical scenarios are very unrealistic. Not worth your watch, particularly if you work in health!
2	"I really like the show except for one thing. The sudden BLARING music during some action scene that really has nothing to do with the scene or goes along with the action. The first time it happened I thought maybe some car arrived on the scene with the stereo blasting. They need to either tone it way down or find a music director who knows how to place better music in scenes.As for the action and writing. The ""Rookie"" himself is often a bit of a ""Dudley Do-Right"" who always does the right thing no matter what. I'm not too sure just how realistic that is, but we need to see some in law enforcement on tv who aren't willing to bend or break the rules just to get their case solved like we see so often in other police shows. The story lines are usually pretty good too with the primary characters being far deeper than the two dimensional characters we see on a lot of cop shows. If not for that blaring inappropriate to the situation music I'd given this a 10."
2	Started this and thought it was a nice light thing to watch, especially judging by the trailer and the beginning of the first episode. It was pretty funny, very well shot, acting is great. Binged a few episodes and it seemed to get darker and darker until half way through the season and holy hell, that went a whole different way. This is an amazing show, it definitely isn't 'light watching' though. Had to switch it off and watch a few episodes of 'is it cake' just to clear our palette 😂 It's amazing but we really weren't ready for that, we really just wanted some light viewing, but it does grip you and reel you in to watch more. Probably needs a warning at the beginning because it was disturbia central up in here.
2	Did you fire the writers for season 8 and wing it?? John Snow's character was consistent through and through. He would have never killed her! The dragon queen wasn't supposed to be mad. She would not have burned the town. Aria was the master killer. She was supposed to kill beautifully at the end. It seems like all your viewers that hate the ending knew the characters better than you and could have written the end to a masterpiece now ruined Probably by some selfish multi millionaire ego(s). Redo it. Get the writers back and make it right!
2	This show was so good for so many years I am unsure as to why they keep dragging it out. They should've ended it seasons ago and just stopped while it was still good. All in all worth the watch but I stopped watching it a few seasons ago
1	Engaging upto 2 seasons then it turned out to be ridiculous TV show for me .. I'm a doctor and considering medically it showcased patient emotions and interactions quite well but eventually story gets messy and it's related always something personal with the characters. I ended watching the show after completing 3 seasons.
1	Watched first 2 episodes of Ripley on Netflix. I was first impressed by the pristine black n white cinematography and production design depicting NYC in the '60s. At the end of episode 2, I lost interest.Talented Mr. Ripley written by Patricia Highsmith was published in the mid '50s.The book was first made by Rene Clement into Purple Noon starring Alain Delon and Maurice Ronet which remains a classic.Theatre 2nd adaptation was by Anthony Minghella in 1999 staring Matt Damon as Ripley and Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf.It was well made and entertaining.Ripley the new mini series was created, written and directed by the prolific film/TV series writer/director Steven Zaillian.Theatre reviews are mixed. Some complained its 'glacial' plot development.It is possible that the book might not have enough content to fill an 8 episode mini series.That being said, the problem with this Ripley is the casting. Firstly, both actors for Ripley and Dickie are too old for their roles. They supposed to be in the mid-20's while Andrew Scott and Johnny Flynn are weathered looking in their mid to late 30's.As Ripley, Andrew Scott is a good actor who first appeared as Moriaty in Sherlock the TV series, but he lacks dual charisma as the innocent looking Ripley but a cold, cunning psychopath in reality. Johnny Flynn the British actor looks nothing like a care free rich boy who supposed to be the idol of Ripley for his wealth and sex appeal. The actor has a bit speech impediment, bloated face and looking much uncomfortable in his role. Dakota Fanning as Dickie friend Marge who's supposed to have an on n off again relationship with Dickie also looked ill fitting and too old.Talented Mr. Ripley the book has a major flaw. After the demise of Dickie, Ripley went around Italy impersonating Dickie and siphoning off his money. He might get by in Italy in the early '50s but readers might wonder unless these 2 characters have resemblance. Maybe that's why Hitchcock filmed Stranger on the Train instead.Another oddity of Ripley is the casting of a woman Eliot Sumner as Freddie Miles who was played by Philip Seymour Hoffman in the earlier version. This time Ripley dragged his feet down the stairs with his head banging on the steps. I don't remember how Matt Damon did in The Talented Mr. Ripley.The series was filmed in beautiful locales in the isle of Capri standing in for Atrani.
2	This show although at first glance seems boring, developes to one of the most thrilling series I've ever seen everything from the acting and storytelling was extremely well done. The only negatives portrayed by the show is its stretched out and unnatural scenes that in one scene can be breathtaking but in the other a overdramatic unrealistic mess. Although it states it's based on a true story that is far from the case, while the idea is; the story is not. Either way this show is definitely worth watching and anyone who enjoys dark shows with in-depth storytelling will find baby reindeer a thrilling end enjoyable show.
1	Available on Hulu and FX, Shogun is an American production co-created by husband-and-wife duo Justin Marks and Rachel Kondo. The creators proudly used Japanese as the prominently spoken language in the show to enhance authenticity and they supplemented it with English subtitles, and dubbing (available only on Hulu). While I appreciate the dedication to authenticity, it's worth noting that many English-speaking viewers, myself included, find that subtitles and dubbing hinder the enjoyment of a show.For me, enjoying a show goes beyond its visual appeal and world-building aspects, although I do enjoy those aspects as well, and 'Shogun' has that in spades. I feel that appreciating the nuances of character conversations is paramount, and that gets lost with subtitles. Similarly, no matter how good the dubbing is, it always feels awkward and disconnected, taking away from being fully enraptured with the storyline. It's regrettable really, because the production quality is undeniably remarkable and I'm sure the cast is brilliant.It can't be understated enough that my preference against subtitles and dubbing is solely based on my personal entertainment experience and is not meant to offend anyone. It's just a matter of personal enjoyment. And isn't that what a television show is supposed to be about?
0	Lets be honest, the concept is interesting. Unfortunately, they took this concept threw it in the trash, spit on it, and decided it was good to go. What even was the pacing? It is hard to know how much time has passed, the ending was not intriguing for another season, and not a single character was remotely likeable.I don't understand the split between the main characters and the push and pull with the plot. It would have been much better focusing on 3 of the group rather than randomly switching all focus between them and giving them predictable dialogue.Ended up having my finger on the 5 second skip button the last episode because I just wanted it to be over. So much wasted potential for a unique concept. Feels like they've bitten off more than they can chew.
0	The rookie starts of quite engaging but goes to hell after the third season. At one point it is really only about pushing an agenda down the viewers throat, which is so obvious and poorly done, that it hurts during some scenes.Some of the early characters have some really complex development, but most of the newly introduced ones are shallow and cliché.The sassy FBI rookie lady in the fourth season being the pinnacle of obnoxious self entitlement, which finally made me quit the show.Furthermore the whole poshness and fancy lifestyle, which almost all of the characters display, doesn't work for me and feels unnatural to a cops life.The overall quality of this show falls of so rapidly that I can't recommend it the slightest.
2	"Overall Game of Thrones is a stellar character-driven medieval fantasy with magic and dragons. The title tell you all you need to know. Power. The pursuit of power, the attainment of power, and the difficulty of holding power. The question is, can they stick the landing. They did not. They had a choice in season 8 to be Shakespearean or to be Dynasty. To be or not to be a tragedy or to be a cliche Hollywood trope. Trope it is. In the beginning the Stark clan is not much of a power player but the Lannister are. By the end they both are consummate duplicitous players. The ""gaslighting"" of Daenerys and Jon over the revelation they are aunt and nephew, which neither were aware of until revealed to them is the worst part of the epic failed ending. A few more minutes in each episode of them attempting to deal with the information, showing them attempting to stay connected physically beyond the meager attempts shown would have made a difference. It left me wondering, does he still really love her? One doesn't know because there no scene of him or her alone struggling with his or her thoughts holding something that represents each other, crying or clutching that object. Hell, Jamie and Cersei got a better fully realized emotional death scene then Daenerys. And Daenerys was just as psychically wounded a character as Cersei was. Why is her death scene so mechanical, cold and to borrow a phrase, done ""with extreme prejudice?"" The justification. She is turning into Colonel Kurtz"" and ""Hitler."" Actually, she is ""gaslighted"" into it by the Starks. She is no longer useful to them and way too powerful to control. She has the dragon. That makes her a superpower. It's hard to kill the dragon now. She is not. Her willingness to use violence is open and has always been known, but so is Arya's. She and Jon and Arya are probably the least duplicitous main characters in the series. The rest of them get others to do the dirty work. The other epic fail of the series end is the unwillingness the treat the Starks and Tyrion as the cunning players for the game of pursuing the throne. They are portrayed as survivors and heroes of the game for the throne. They are not. Nor is Tyrion. As for the assassination of Daenerys, Jon is reduced to a plot prop as ""an errand boy, sent by grocers to collect a bill "" to borrow another phase. Finally, Drogon torching the throne and melting it to the ground isn't because it's represents evil. It's because it belongs to Daenerys and no one will ever sit on it again. End of story."
1	I was seriously intriguied when I saw that Nolan an Joy are directing this, but what is this series about? It feels like a super boring adaptation of a video game. No characters to feel engaged with, just blood and gore and unmeaningfull dialogue. Sorry, but where is the fine craftswomanship from Westworld?The main thing that kept me going was the backstory. I loved the vault setting and the flashbacks, but the wasteland was just pointless, like an old western, but with the violence of japanese horror.Maybe I would appreciate if I played the video games, but as an outsider this is just pointless.
1	Never played the game and think that is a problem for the series, I don't have a bond with the series to be able to stick with it. I've made it through 4 episodes and whilst not being bad it's not hooked me in to finish it off.If I don't go back to finish it I wouldn't be too bothered about it either.Show started off well and had great hopes for it, it fizzled out into yet another dystopian show with the same factions fighting for survival, gave me snowpiercer vibes.It also feels like Disney got involved in the making of it, some gory scenes followed up by a lot of PG moments. Maybe makes sense if you've played the game but for me it hasn't convinced me enough to finish it off.
1	I absolutely love romance and drama. The characters are pretty interesting, and it's a good show to zone out on. I do like the show, and i'll probably watch every single episode. However, the show contains an unhealthy amount of political bias. Characters are constantly criticizing the president and constitutional laws. The writers attempt to depict a Christian is theologically off in every single way. I don't know how the writers are still paid to write such bad television.
1	"Andrew Scott performance is dull throughout the series! I get that he has to be introverted and mysterious but he ends up doing the same and the same over again just appear calm and relaxed! Very shallow adaptation to the character adding the shallow writingsSame for the other main actors, Dakota is lacking character arch and expressions she just acts one note ""I don't trust you"".The best acting of the whole series is John Malkovich at the end that acts for 5 minutes and we can finally say ""oh here's a good actor""Having said the above the PHOTOGRAPHY is phenomenal and each shot is like a piece of art! 6/10 for photography and direction3/10 for casting, acting, writing."
0	"2nd season was really good, a few nice episodes but the overall experience was somehow not the same. The end of the 2nd season was amazing but then by the 3rd season the storytelling was a mess. Several characters introduced that were completely forgotten, pieces of stories that never had a ""conclusion"", the woke part of the series was like the only thing they could use as a writing excuse. Overall, 3rd season was bored, with just a couple of good episodes. Season 4, well, I am not sure how it is going to end but now it is worst than just boring ... It is pointless. It is a pity, it was a excellent series that I was always recommending it, but now I have to say that it is at most 2 complete seasons of 4 watchable. The rating here could be misguided, many ppl probably gave this show an 8 or a 9 because of the first season, but tbh, last 2 seasons were terrible boring.Is it terrible bad? Not sure, I've watched worst things, but you should not sit and watch this show thinking that it will be something memorable, otherwise you are going to hate spending more than +80 hrs of your life on story that will break apart week after week, and eventually you will believe this is a 1 star series like many recent reviewers."
2	"I have read books and the Chinese TV version series, and the speed and rewriting is OK for me. They have the soul of the book. The biggest problem is that many important concepts in the original book have not been explained in detail ,such as quantum entanglement. We can stop and Google while reading , but not when watching TV. Also concept like ""Technology lock"" If the play spend an extra 30 seconds explaining each concept, it would be much better. Audiences can have a clearer understanding of what challenges is facing. And without those Concepts, it's just another ""aliens come to get things from us"" story."
2	"So I succesfully avoided major spoilers about the show and could binge watch this since the complete Box set came out in early December. The first season was a bit overwhelming, what with all the houses and characters thrown at you. As you may be able to tell, I have not read the source material. Not sure who of the cast had read it beforehand either. So bare that in mind.Now the line Winter is coming is something everyone associates with the show, I just never expected this to come up so early in the show. What is surprising, at least during the first seasons of the show, is how many supposedly main characters fail to survive. This keeps the viewers on their tows. Towards the end of the show this gets a bit watered down. Not sure how much influence the original author had there (he had only written material for the first 6 seasons of the show, the rest was made up).Having said that, you can feel a drop in quality. And while I have friend who thought the second season was boring (it's a bit of a travelling show and things get stretched quite a bit), if he continued to watch, he might feel even worse with the last seasons. Even though they are shorter (episode wise, not time wise per episode), they feel stretched even more.Also the conclusion (no worries, I'm not telling) is anticlimatic to say the least. It feels bad and the continuity errors are just thrown aside. So if not for the epic battles and the actors, who are all really amazing in this, I might have gone farther down with my vote. Then again, if it wasn't for the last season specifically, I might have given it a 10 too ... A prequel show has been axed for now (not sure if the bad reviews and or numbers for the last season played a role), but I would watch it. This achieved overall something that ""The Reign"" could not: combine violence, fantasy and nudity into something mature/adult that works for men and women watching"
2	As a gamer, I find it pretty embarrassing looking at some of the 1 or 2 star reviews that seem based on idealised visions of a game from 27 years ago. It's not 1997, folks, you can step out of Vault 13 and look at the world around you and see how it has evolved.Placing the games to one side, this is a highly enjoyable series. The main cast members are great in their respective roles - I particularly enjoyed Walton Goggins but all three inhabit their characters well. The large array of side characters also provide plenty of interest and there's some really tight performances throughout the 8 episodes.The visual effects range from stellar to just acceptable. This is a tv programme though and not a $400m, 2-hour, blockbuster, movie so it may be advantageous to set your expectations accordingly.I'll keep my fingers crossed that this is received well by the general viewership and that we can see this pushing into further seasons - it'd be a real shame if the opinions of some review-bombing or gatekeeping gamers affected the future of this satisfying show.
0	"I see the bots are in overdrive ten-starring this series, just wait a few weeks until the real ratings bring down the average. I watched three episodes and I just don't get it, the other reviews keep gushing about what an exceptional show this is but I'm just not seeing it. The acting is terrible. The first episode doesn't make any sense...why would he go out with her? He's clearly not attracted to her. Why would he follow her home? Yeah, some ""masterpiece"", some of you people throw this word around a lot these days to the point where it's meaningless. The main character's stand-up routine isn't remotely funny. Awful."
2	"This show is pretty spot on! A bit better than another Video game show I have been watching!! I keep seeing places that I saw in the game, places I went into and explored. Makes me want to play the games again! The bloodiness, violence and cornyness is exactly how the game was! I am having so many aha moments, elbowing my husband, saying, ""Hey that scene or monster or character looks just like the game!! The characters are pretty close to what was in the game! Loving it so far!!PKeep following the games and we will continue to watch the show.If you haven't played the games, I hope this inspires you, they are so much fun and you have to use your imagination to make them your own!!"
0	"After watching another lackluster adaptation in ""The Last of US"", I was hoping this one would be better. However, it was not. The acting, especially Maximus, his squire, and to a lesser extent, Lucy, drag the show down. The guy who plays Maximus is especially terrible. The writing is especially awful. Very little of the dialogue is unique or interesting. None of it is funny or thought-provoking to me. You would think that a highly anticipated TV show with Amazon and a Nolan behind it could have been done better. I guess this is just the world we live in. A race by streaming companies to provide as much content as possible without placing emphasis on some of the basic elements to a good TV show: writing and acting. Other than the set design, which was pretty great, this show is bad."
2	I had doubts, I tried to avoid hype. I expected something mild, more suitable for soft audience. I am delighted that the series is nothing like that, it is fallout in every way. I don't care about noticing minor errors, hell, this is good. It has atmosphere, it is dark, it has sense of humor, gore, whatever you would expect from a good Fallout game.Story. It is generally good, I would say typical Bethesda. Not the strongest point, but well written.Why not 10/10?I missed the even deeper darkness of the first two games. It wasn't particularly cruel. Could go deeper.Could use somewhat slower pace, more episodes, more focus on individual characters, they could have been deeper.Missing NCR flaws.VaultTec storyline. I don't want to spoiler here, if you are a fan, you will understand what I do refer here.Still, 8/10 is perfectly earned. If you are Fallout fan, don't miss it.
0	Though the science fiction is picturised with a lot of grandeur, I feel that the story did not make any sense.It appears that the San-tis (extraterrestrials) learns what lie is from Evans and hence, severing the communications with humanity, but they have already concocted a plan and embedded the sophans to alter the reality (of scientific experiments) in order to shunt the progress of human race - I don't understand this conflict.So, I am keen to find out how the plot unwinds in the future, undoing the above conflict or would it?Also, if the san-tis are present in human reality through sophons, why use old school radios and mics to communicate with evans?
1	Although I think they are doing a great job with acting and the visuals it seems they are deviating from the book when it isn't necessary. The ability of Blackthorne to learn the language and actually accept the culture is being changed. His friendship with Rodriguez and fight against the Portuguese aren't being used. The machinations of Toranaga are being shortchanged. The village headman being revealed as a samurai working for Toranaga isn't revealed until the end of the book. Although dated now, the mini series in 1980 did a better job of conveying the book. The politics and the moves made by Lady Ochiba and Lady Mariko are not being utilized correctly. The back story on why the Lady Ochiba hates Toranaga should have been explored. Translating a book to the screen is always difficult but they are falling short. Having said that if you haven't read the book I'm sure it's easier to enjoy it.
2	I think it's important to begin my review by saying that I have not read the books. I'm sure that the impact and reception of the show will differ for those who have read them.With that said, this show is amazing. It's rare for a show to suck me in and have me as curious about what happens next as this show has. That's really all I have to say, I don't want to spoil the plot for anyone.Wade is probably my favorite character so far. I love that dry British humor--REVIEW OVER-------I think it's important to begin my review by saying that I have not read the books.

1	"I don't think the series is bad, but I have the same problem with it as I did with ""Fallout 4"" - yes, it's still Fallout, but somehow it's not my Fallout anymore. Too colorful, too squeaky, too childish. The series unfortunately doesn't make me think about going back to New Vegas.Maybe my problem is that I didn't like Fallout 4 and have been very critical of the whole franchise ever since, and maybe I'm too old. ""Fallout 1"", ""Fallout 2"", ""Fallout Tactics: Broterhood of Steel"", ""Fallout 3"" and ""Fallout: New Vegas"" are games that I remember fondly, but Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 were disasters in my eyes.This series isn't a disaster, but it's rather mediocre for me."
1	I have never read the book but I loved the original mini series with Richard Chamberlin. The first 2 episodes were some of the best television that I have seen in a long time and I couldn't wait to see more. The Asian actors are amazing and the intricate plotting against the beautiful scenery is impressive. The costume design is the best I have seen on tv since Game of Thrones.Unfortunately much of the rest of the series does not live up to the promising start. I put most of the blame for this on the way the series portrays Blackthorne. The actor acts more like a big goofy frat boy than a hardened seaman. As a navigator he would have to be fairly intelligent but we never really see this. There is no chemistry with Mariko. We are told that they are deeply in love but we never really see this relationship develop. He never really seems to be a major character in the story.I found the finale very disappointing. After all of the plotting, buildup and lives sacrificed I expected more.
1	Why do they have the background music so loud. Can't hear what the actors are saying. The no ice is very annoying. I have considered not watching since I can't hear over the loud music.
2	Don't know how to put it, but Fallout really did take me by surprise. Being a big Fallout fan, I honestly was a bit skeptical to see how Todd Howard could try to not adapt the games into this story and instead go with a whole new story that goes differently than the OG games or the Bethesda titles. But I kinda like it.The goods. First, the characters are actually well developed. Lucy, out main character, is quite charming and enjoyable to follow along as she tries to look for her father whom as taken from her in the Vault (Fallout 3 copy?). She does see the world outside in a more positive outlook in life, as a naïve Vault Dweller would, but would soon see it differently.The Ghoul was another great ensemble to the characters. A once TV star that has endured the 200 years above ground and is now a bounty hunter that is also at risk of turning feral. It's also great that we have flashbacks of his past before the Great War.Another great highlight is the story itself. Suffice to say it has everything a good story should have, plus the humor and charm that the Fallout games possess. Music, aesthetic, and of course, the whole plot with the Vaults like in any other Fallout game.The only thing I would've loved to see was more backstory on the NCR and what happened to the rest of them when Shady Sands was destroyed. But crossing my fingers season 2 will tap into the New Vegas lore.I would say Fallout is a great TV show to watch. And it's one thing that actually works in the minds of Todd Howard.
2	"WOW, I watched the pilot this morning and it was way impressive.Honestly, I had no hope for this show. I figured after ""Firefly"" and ""Castle"" that Nathan Fillion was just on the Jump-the-Shark train from now on, especially after the controversial ending of ""Castle"" and issues with his co-star Stana Katic. Well--I was wrong! I was riveted, the Pilot was really good!Sure, a little bit of Nathan Fillion spilled out, but that's what makes him who he is and it was tolerable. He didn't go into the Brooding Mal or the silly Castle--he was just right. He actually looks like he got into shape to play this role, kudos to him for working so hard. Let's face it, he's a good looking man, and here he looks like he did in ""Firefly"" with just a few more smile lines.I stuck around to watch eps. 2 and 3. And I am totally on board. It's an eye opening procedural that really shows what rookies in the LAPD must go through. The fact that it's from the perspective of a 40 something year old rookie definitely gives an interesting twist!There is drama, action, emotion, heart and humor. AND the police body cam shots are new and interesting, they really add to the experience. I give a huge double thumbs up, go and watch it! If you like police procedurals or Nathan Fillion you can't go wrong.Oh, and if the writer's are reading, please have some guest stars from the ""Firefly"" and ""Castle"" days. that would be cool! ;)"
0	Great cinematography, and acting by the Japanese actors, everything else weak. Starts off promising then gets dull. A ton of proverbs that mean nothing. Constant pointless flashbacks. A slow build with the lure of a big payoff - that never happens. Zero humour. If by episode 6 you are bored, stop. It doesn't get better. Why do I need so many freaking characters in my review ?! Ugh, ok. The Caucasian lead has a face that looks weird, because it doesn't move. Are male actors getting Botox now ? There are much better shows out there. Zero chance I'd watch another season. Ok, finally enough characters to end my review.
1	"I've never read the source material but I can't imagine the 5 ""geniuses"" being this annoying and unbelievable - especially, Salazar. She is the most unlikeable character of all time and I'm supposed to believe she created some nano-tech that would have required collaboration with other people? What other people could stand to be in a room with her for more than 5 minutes. The actor who plays her is awful too.Actually all the actors are awful except Liam, Wong, and the guy who plays Will.The story has some great moments but those moments quickly fade as the ""geniuses"" plan this ridiculous mission to send a human brain into outer space.It would have been a better story if they would have focused on what these scientists are really doing at CERN? Enough with the aliens from outer space garbage. That was done 50 years ago!!But, again, believing these young scientists created all this and are soooo brilliant is so unbelievable that it is almost impossible to watch.This is a 5 because there are some really cool moments in episodes 2-6. The last two episodes are ridiculous except that they finally get rid of Salazar! I was hoping she'd be wrapped after episode one. Ugh."
1	I've been a fan of The Rookie from season one, thought it was an excellent concept which a lot of people could relate to (Nolan moving from rural PA to join the LAPD).I think as we move into season five the characters have become more cardboard-like, particularly the new recruit, her character is barely believable.The whole will-they, wont-they with Chen and Bradford is a good angle which has developed well. Yet the Rosiland storyline is being dragged out too much.Overall, its still a good watch and its own unique style, but compared to other PD dramas such as Blue Bloods or Chicago PD, its got a lot of catching up to do.
1	"To quote Eddie Murphy: ""If you're starving and somebody throw you a cracker you gonna be like this: Goddang, that's the best cracker I ever ate in my life!""Shogun is such a cracker.It's an ok show, but nothing special compared to actually great TV shows.However, we live in a time of DEI-infested garbage entertainment and bad writing, so regular audiences have a hunger for TV shows and movies that at least don't suck.Shogun isn't bad, but it's not great either.Production quality is high and the acting is fine, albeit Cosmo Jarvis comes across as a caricature in the main role.The pacing is slow and it's very hard to get invested in any of the plethora of characters, or the uncompelling plotline. I wouldn't call it boring, but just too much work for too little payoff.While I understand the high rating when compared to what else is out there right now, please don't expect a show that can compete with a pre-woke era show with a 9+ rating.It's a nice cracker, but that's all."
0	A muddled mess interposing things from the novels with things not in them and completely out of order. If you haven't read the books it's probably a 2/10 as the series is a jumbled mess.The novels are an immense sci-fi opera with a massive scope and beautifully woven together to lead you through a series of philosophical and complex scientific ideas to conclude with a terrifying premise.The 3 body problem is a genuinely unsolvable scientific problem. Another unsolvable question is the Fermi Paradox posed by the brilliant mathematician Enrico Fermi when he asked 'where is everybody', these novels propose a worrying answer.
0	Its a trap and it starts at season 3! Don't waste your time.
2	"With only 2 episodes out so far, I find this show to be really well done whether or not you have read the book or saw the 1980 mini-series with Richard Chamberlain. Hiroyuki Sanada is one of my favourite actors and his performance, as well as the other cast members is superb. The show is very authentic looking and most of the dialogue is in Japanese, which really adds to the atmosphere and gives you a sense of being in 1600s Japan. Except for one scene (IMHO), the cinematography is really good. Unlike the 1980 series, there is a darker ""feel"" which better portrays what was going on at that time. Looking forward to seeing the rest of the series."
2	"I was hoping this would be good. Last thing you wanna do is get the Fallout fan base angry, which after reading reviews on here and Facebook, you would think it was teally bad. Well, it's not. They have an opportunity here. Not following a specific game and starting elsewhere was a great move. The feel and the story is so far, true to the lore. The vault, the wasteland, the weapons, suits, all of it good. Don't listen to the fanboy ""experts"". Even if this wasn't Fallout based, it's still a good show. Looking forward to what's to come and so far it's good. I highly recommend it, Fallout fan or not!!!"
1	"The story of a stalker. More broadly, the study of how unstable people find each other and do further damage to themselves and others.A true story written and performed by Richard Gadd, who once felt bad for a strange woman spinning tall tales at his workplace one day. What happens next is a tragedy of errors immortalized in text, film, and police reports. Along the way, Richard grapples with the growing awareness that he might (in fact) be part of the problem in his own life, and an active source of harm to others. Drama ensues.This series directly addresses themes of pity, self-loathing, and vulnerability. More authentically, ""Baby Reindeer"" represents life with a personality disorder through the eyes of a sufferer.The principal theme appears to by ""pity,"" both as the condition the Author feels for his stalker and the technique by which he maneuvers through life or manipulates others into meeting his needs. It is this same pity he requires from us, the audience: both in his fantasy routines as a sad clown comedian, and the actual effect of this series. Richard needs us to feel bad for him as a victim of circumstance/grooming/stalking as an excuse for his admitted neglect and mistreatment of those unlucky enough to wander into his path.While ""Baby Reindeer"" is well-acted and thoughtfully composed, the Author's manipulation of the audience detracts from its quality. The startling absence of any personal growth or redemption arc leaves us feeling like we've been cornered by a burned-out narcissist at a bar instead of leading us to a moral conclusion about life, relationships, or the development of virtue. It is abundantly clear this man needs serious help - not just from a ""therapist"" he found on a dating website, but probably an actual psychiatrist who can help level out the extremes in his thinking/behavior long enough to respond to talk therapy. This is the extent of my pity for the Author and his potentially wasted life experience.Bonus points for accurately illustrating modern-day London as a dark and depraved cesspool of Babylonian proportions."
2	Flash backs, Boring, former Actors coming back as Meredith is near to death, storyline absolutely weak. And, we just dont need a whole season about covid, covid, deaths, and covid... i cant go further than 8 episodes. I try but falling asleep after 30 mins, or watching in replay in accelerated.It really smells like the final season...
2	I almost gave up on this show about halfway through the first episode. I actually turned it off and started rewatching Game of Thrones on HBO Max. But tonight I decided to give it another shot and I am really glad that I did. The second half of episode 1 and all of episode 2 were really quite good. Now I am hooked and looking forward to seeing what's next.I don't mind having to read subtitles for a portion of each episode, and I certainly couldn't care less about whether the Portuguese explorers and the Catholics from centuries ago are portrayed as the bad guys (at least so far).Good character development and developing plot lines seem to be setting up for an interesting path forward. Despite what other people have said about this series, there has not been any nudity or sex scenes through the first two episodes.Worth a watch for sure.
1	Obnoxious, condescending, selfish witch- Maggie makes my blood pressure rise and I yell at the Tv screen when she is onscreen! Can't put the names I call her in this review. Make her GO AWAY! She and her holier than thou sister Meredith just set my teeth on edge with the way they think they are always right and everyone else is always wrong. UG! Case in point - a man moved across the country for Meredith but does she even bother to tell him before sending a global email that she is moving to Boston? Nope. Selfish. And now in season 19 ep16 Amelia is displaying cluelessness about her horrible sisters. Can't wait for Maggie to JUST GO TO CHICAGO! But there are enough other characters that are not obnoxious to make it worthwhile to watch! Guess I'll just have to keep yelling at the Tv. Final note - sad that the heartless reviewers that have a problem with the societal topics display a lack of self reflection!
2	Everything was good until the last season, the villain they've been built slowly from the beginning just went to the death that easily and doesn't make any sense at all. One more Daenerys's dead could be easily predicted in early or mid season i guess. You gonna get a perfectly cooked golden steak in season 1-6 and a raw steak on the rest of the series.
2	Looks like the producers did their research. A little exaggeration but it is subtle and the show is very enjoyable. Love seeing the new episodes and the dynamic of the three main rookies.
1	I binged watch this in one day , acting , cinematography, script , tone , music everything was more than good but how come and no one mentions that ntoni is more mentally unstable than martha , if this was fiction it would be great , two mentally unstable characters interacting with each other , but this was true story , wtf , the guy has so many mental issues , like he can easily be a case study for psychology students The fact that had his mental breakdown on camera and got his 5 mins of fame , and then was clever enough to see the potentials and exploit them doesn't make him ok !The guy need immediate medical attention.
0	Given the excellent episodic series we have seen on TV in recent years, I expected a modern, respectful adaptation of the incredible story of 'Shogun.'Sadly, the result is extremely disappointing. Toranaga is a shadow of his former self, Mariko is nothing like the original character and is downright unbelievable, and Blackthorn has been so diminished that he could almost be removed from the storyline entirely.The incredibly rich and complex story imagined by Clavell has been violated and distorted beyond recognition, but for what exactly? This series can be grouped with 'The Rings of Power' for a futile, pointless distortion of the original storyline, where only the title and the names of the characters remain, not their personalities.Mariko is inconsistent. Initially, she is outright hostile to Blackthorne, for no apparent reason and in conflict with the tasks required by her leader, Toranaga. Then, she shows some friendliness, only to become irate again, and she speaks to her superiors in a manner that would have been unthinkable during the Japanese feudal era. Granted, if Japan is highly sexist today, it was extremely harsh for women back then. Nevertheless, if you are making a period piece, accuracy is required. The show's writers not only completely disrespect the original story but also any semblance of historical accuracy.The offense continues with Lady Ochiba taking control of the Council of Regents (not in the story) simply because she asked for it. This utter nonsense, which would never have happened, of course, fits the political agenda of showcasing strong female characters to satisfy modern sensibilities. It's a pure political manifesto, overriding truth, historical accuracy, and storyline-no more, no less than Soviet propaganda in post-revolution Russia.The violation continues with the portrayal of Toranaga as a leader who openly states his thoughts, a complete reversal from the actual character. There's barely any trace of the real Toranaga, his military and political genius, or the majesty that Toshiro Mifune so perfectly embodied in the excellent 1980s series.Father Alvito and all the plots involving the Portuguese priests are almost gone, though they were integral to the story. Losing these elements means losing the Hitchcockian aspects of the thriller that ran parallel to the story of Blackthorne learning to understand Japanese culture. These parallel stories of intrigue and political interference are what made the book and the 1980s TV series so satisfying. It seems the creators of the messy 2024 pastiche have little trust in the audience's ability to follow that storyline. To them, I suggest watching the otherwise fantastic 'Ripley.'The costumes are lavish and the cinematography is adequate, although it suffers from the current trend of making many scenes dull, grey, and uninspiring, all based on the misguided concept of 'realism' aided by the artificiality of digital cameras. It's acceptable but not noteworthy.There are many other issues, but mentioning them all would make this review overly lengthy. The verdict is: stay away, read the book instead, or watch the 1980s series with Chamberlain and Mifune.
0	S4 E17 The environmental BS....the water boy at the cooler is a moron! And selling to morons will work, but not for the educated! Give us a break. Done will stop watching your brain washing tactics!
1	It is emotional series that makes me cry and laugh at the same episode. I love grey's character but some time confused me.i cried so much when some of the doctors died.
0	"I'm a movies guy. I read approximately one book in two years and feel proud of this incredible achievement for the next five.I've always hated when people compared movies to books and said one or the other is better.It's like comparing a sculpture to an oil painting -- either one can be equally sh&^t and its nothing to do with the medium.You can't do that.I'm now going to do that.There is Contact by Carl Sagan and there is Contact by Robert Zemeckis. The later one is more simplified, more hollywoodised and even got a still-in-a-rom-com-mode-Matthew-McConaughey in it.Both of these two are great. I loved the book and I love rewatching the movie over and over again ever since it came out.There is The Martian by Andy Weir and The Martian by Matt damn it, by Ridley Scott.Both are hollywoodised, both are not simplified, neither has still-in-a-rom-com-mode-Matthew-McConaughey in it, both are great.There is Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang and there is Arrival by Denis Villeneuve. The movie is a must for every sci-fi lover and I haven't yet read the novel but it won a Nebula (not Thanos's daughter. The award.) I'm sure its amazing too. (the book, not the daughter)There is 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke and there is 2001: A Space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick.There is Solaris by Stanislaw Lem and there is Solaris by Andrei Tarkovsky (sorry George)And then there is The Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin and... there is this.This, where a nanomaterials researcher looks and acts like a spoiled entitled supermodel, where soapy relationships of freshly made-up characters are more important than anything else happening in the first 500 pages of the book, and where the ""entire Universe"" thinks so little of its viewers' intelligence it flickers in visible light.(so visible you can see it at night even when a glowing display is stuck to your retinas)I can't compare this series to The Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin.It'd be like comparing a Mona Lisa painting to a sculpture of her nose made out of a sweet potato.The only thing I can think of comparing it to is Foundation by Apple Tv.Because of the way these two treat the unique, extraordinary ideas bestowed upon them by their source materials, they, together with their creators, have a special place reserved for them in hell."
2	When I say I am a huge fan of the books, it's a big time understatement. I've studied them intensely and participated in discussions about all kinds of things. I gave it a 8 out of 10 because without the source material there was a very tall mountain to climb. The books contain much more magic, darker twists and way too many characters for a television series. They did a very satisfying job wrapping up the greatest story over told considering such.9 out of 10 particularly because not only was it a fun enjoyable show, the acting was amazing. The cinematography was amazing, the CGI was amazing, the directing was amazing. If I have one major critique it was the quality of the dialogue more than the direction of the story that made the final seasons feel different than the beginning. Some characters became one-dimensional caricatures of themselves, including unfortunately Tyrion, Cersei, Jon. Euron is the show's biggest failure.But still I will always love this show for bringing these characters to the small screen.
0	It doesn't matter how good the previous seasons were if the ending is terrible.
1	"Not a big sci-fi fan, but I live with one who was overly excited to see this adaptation of a Chinese trilogy of books. As you can imagine, I was less than eager. I do understand from readers of the books that this is a hard trilogy to depict on screen...which explains the heavy use of CGI and in more than just ""the game"".In the eight episodes that make up season one there are two timelines running...one contemporary and one in the 1960's China under Chairman Mao's regime. In fact that is where the story starts (a deviation from the timeline of the original books), with the public beating and death of a physics teacher with his daughter in witness. His daughter ends up in a lumber work camp...and eventually is brought to a remote research center that is trying to communicate with an alien race who eventually answers back thanks to her disobeying a direct order. The real question becomes did she doom the human race thanks to that one decision?Meanwhile in contemporary times science is no longer making sense and a whole series of scientists appear to be killing themselves. There is a group investigating all of this, there are shiny helmets that seem to have advanced technology and involve playing a game, there is a countdown, the stars wink...there is a floating ark with a group who seem to believe the aliens are our saviors in a religious fanatic kind of way...and then there is the most unbelievable part of the whole story: five friends in the U. K. seem to be the smartest minds in the world and seem to have all of these events happening to and around them?!?!?!I don't want to get in to the science or lack-there-of, because I am an applied scientist not a theoretical one and while complex theories are mentioned or talked around...they are never explained in detail.I enjoyed Liam Cunningham's character Thomas Wade tremendously. I think he and his interactions are some of the best in the series. I enjoyed the comedy (intentional or not) between him and actor Benedict Wong who plays his underling Da Shi. The friends for the most part I found super annoying and most unbelievable as theoretical (or otherwise) physicists! There was the weirdest vibe between Auggie Salazar and Jin Cheng...and if the fate of the human race is in the pot smoking ambitious-less Saul Durand hands, we are in so much trouble. Although I am enjoying the ""I refuse"" and no one believing...great comedy.Marlo Kelly plays a great villainous character in Tatiana. She has creepy down to perfection. I enjoyed the concept of not trusting someone who admits to having told a lie...and the bug analogy, seemed at the time like there were better analogies that could have been made, but it ends up working in to the story so perfectly with ""the message"" and then Da Shi's pep talk. So, in the end I enjoyed it. The Panama Canal scene...while overly CGI'd was interesting. I am also really enjoying Saamer Usmani who plays Raj Varma, he is amazing. I think the character of Jin Cheng needs to wake up and smell the coffee and realize how good she has it with Raj...because frankly he could do better.The show was ok, but kind of middle of the road for a sci-fi series. Didn't make me want to read the book or watch more necessarily...especially since I didn't really find anyone to root for in this depiction."
0	You chose Felix solis to play an FBI agent on the rookie. He is a notorious drug lord on the show Ozark. Awful choice. I love the show but I won't watch that episode. Make better choices.
1	"This is a good-quality post-apocalyptic film adaptation of the game universe, filled with black humor and comical cruelty, so the film is recommended only for viewers over the age of 18. The fifth series stands out in particular, in which excellent directing and a well-developed script create an eccentric adventure of complex characters. The artists did a great job on the visual design, the visual effects are acceptable, and the characters are motivated and their conflicts are readable.The painted inhabitants of the wasteland may seem too plastic, as well as power armor, but the degree of discrepancy does not cause strong dissonance and you can put up with these conventions, because the series has an intriguing plot and voluminous characters. Each character is endowed with an individual character, background, beliefs - you sympathize with them and worry about them.However, it may seem to some viewers that the plot is too focused on personal drama, which is why the series sometimes sags on protracted explanations, which can cause fatigue. Despite this, the film can captivate with intriguing twists, and the atmosphere of the film corresponds to the game lore, which will appeal to fans, but, unfortunately, it does not immerse into the world of the apocalypse, does not convey the threat and struggle for survival, but entertains with bright colors and comical characters. The role of Walton Goggins, who created the colorful, hardened ""The Ghoul"", stands out in particular. Aaron Moten does not seem to me suitable for the image of a knight lover, in my opinion, the casting director should have looked for a more suitable actor: it is somewhat annoying to see his surprised face. Ella Purnell, who was chosen for the role of a resident of the asylum, plays reliably, she emotionally conveys the image of a woman whose worldview will change as the plot develops. In general, the picture was not bypassed by processing for compliance with the quotas of inclusivity and respect for racial diversity, but fortunately, the picture will not focus on gender guidelines.Before watching the movie series ""Fallout"", I was skeptical, but when I started watching, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of work on the script, bold jokes and a realistic look at the post-apocalyptic world. Although I am not a fan of the game, but only played in ""Fallout 3"", I accepted the world of the movie series without a doubt and gladly immersed myself in its atmosphere of radiation and the tragedy of human destinies.As I said, there is too much drama in the picture, from the controversial novice of the brotherhood to the hypocritical caretaker of the asylum. This tragedy, in my opinion, is overloaded, there is clearly not enough humor for balance. It is black humor that sets the crazy pace of post-apocalyptic fun, but it sags under the plot necessity - to build a structure of motives and goals. Rather, this is a feature of the series, not a disadvantage. It's very difficult to please or balance emotions, and I don't blame the authors - they did a good job, and this work is at a decent creative level."
1	I read a review on this comparing it to an expansive saga that was beyond GOT but now I'm not sure if they were on something or watching something else. The blame had to fall this time mainly on the director. Ok, maybe this would make more sense if I remember the original or read the book and maybe it makes more sense with the last two parts, but all I got from this was some convoluted story and some pretty pictures and eye candy. Of course you have to have some bad blank female and an attack on our obviously patriarchical culture but c'mon. Nothing really makes much sense and the historical parts that ham fisted in are too much and too repetitive. It's true, that the japanese considered the portugese as uncivilized savages but do they really need to keep hammering this. (interesting aside, in the greek days anyone who wasn't greek and spoke creek was referred to as a barbarian or one who babbled, which got adopted by the romans and the name barbara literally means woman of the man who babbles, google it). The japanese culture was minimalist because they all live on islands and because they had to place a moratorium on cutting trees before there were no more trees. The japanese were also a warlike society and there was constant infighting but if everyone committed suicide so easy you have to wonder how there was anyone left, or how does someone hit forty, when they could be cutting themselves open for almost any bloop. Japan was also a much more open society regarding sex, hence the fisherman's wife and much more patriarchal than depicted. But, they didn't wear the classy outfits like shown. That's for 2024, not 1600s. The worst part though is the story which makes very little sense if you know any history at all. It's very hard to follow the story between the long takes of someone's face punctuated by a twitch here and there. That's nobody else's fault except the director. It's the director's responsibility to tell the story and doesn't include repetitive historical references which most people wouldn't understand today. And one thing glaringly missing is the japanese side to religion. In two episodes they haven't mentioned anything but the adoption of christianity and the persecution but nothing about shinto or buddhism which would have been the primary religion of choice. C'mon.
1	It's so sad to see them drop the ball on storytelling in the final season. This gives me some Dexter ptsd..
0	First 6 seasons were fantastic but after that everything went south and especially season 8 was the worst! It was rushed and i could not make any emotional connection with any of the characters. Simply put, it was bland! The ending was so bad that it feels like you wasted your precious 10 years for nothing!
1	It was one of my favorites shows but with those 2 last seasons, and especially that ending, I can not recommend it any more..
2	This show has layers! I'm just now starting episode 5. So I'm half way through and I can't imagine how much more Richard Gadd can give us...and how much more Donny can take. You never know where someone has been. The first 3 episodes I had 0 idea that it was a flash forward for episode 4. I would have never known in those first 3 episodes Donny had been through so much! Struggling with confidence, self-identity, intimacy with himself and freedom to barely name a few. I hope to see this show get the accolades it deserves as it brings light to these that should be beautiful and innocent but can be darkened by 1 person at the snap of a finger. Anyway, if you're reading this BE KIND.
0	Season 1 was great, fascinating, but each season the show runners could not hide the fact that they are in the defund the police camp. When you do any research about Fillion, he is best pals with far far left loons like Trudeau and his leftist agenda has ruined a great series. The show wants you to hate the cops but identify with the lead characters who are all cops or a rabid leftist lawyer, Show became utterly unwatchable.
0	As for scenery, visual effects - well they are simply amazing. (except power armor fly animation, motion there was better in 1980s) Items, locations and characters from fallout 4 are precise and looking great.Everything else it gets from bad to worse.Humor, well sometimes depends on your age :P After 3rd episode story becomes very boring, and its starting to focus on moral choices and on not making any sense relation with Lucy and Maximus.Scenes that dont have anything in them last for minutes or are streched beyond reason.Allmost every character in this show is dumb as hell.Scenes of fighting are riddiculus, i dont know if they are dancing or get lost sometimes.Most of things that is happening doesnt make any sense.Survive ability of political correct characters is really annoying.I really enjoyed watching main character - ghul, and tahts it Like the Last of us - another teen movie :( and with such potential ehhmy recomendation - Play Fallout 4 :Das for good adaptaion of a game i recomand Halo.
1	I was waiting for this so long and here it is the most mediocre show of the year. First of all it's a message between Japanese and English. All characters speaking Japanese . Only one character speaking English. I don't know how will this show survive in today's era. This was so boring , slow and mediocre. No big actors no big sets. Story is very boring and slow. Game of thrones will remain epic even now because it had large production values and character development. 8 more episodes to go and I'm out after watching just one episode. Thatswhy I don't trust shows nowadays. This was very overhyped.
0	I wonder if I'm the only person that thinks that these shows should maybe cast a believable actor to play a role?Nano physicist? Think you want a 30 ish year old female who likes going out drinking with friends.Boss of a particle accelerator? 40s female pleaseSeems that there's so many shows these days that are cast by children for children - a child might believe that these people are believable in the roles they have but anyone else has to suspend their disbelief whilst watching a character literally having to tell another character - and you - how well qualified and amazing they are.The whole girl boss meme that has become quite well known might be reductive but also is clearly evident here, as the lead character threatens Nick Frost character that she'll put her fist through his head and then walks off leaving him cowering. It's just not believably how people behave except in weird Netflix world.
2	This is a well done series. The actors are all very good and they all give great performances. The backdrops and scenery are fantastic. I read the book about the same time the original mini series aired. The only down side for me is this one feels a little flat. They've given it a more realistic voice for modern times, but the fire is gone. I kind of miss the old school bombastic Japanize lord. Whether the original series seems more appropriate or not probably depends on your age. I think every generation is more biased against the newer versions. Definitely worth a watch in any case. Will. Looking forward to Gai-jin .
1	This isn't the worst adaption ever (far from it), but neither is it amazing as a standalone piece of entertainment.It's just bland. And unimaginative.Terrible fightscenes. Possibly the worst fight scenes I've seen to date. Apparently we have Steve Battaglia to thank for them, who also made the worst John Wick and Expendable movie fight scenes.Characters are okay. Side characters are kinda funny, sometimes.Dialogue is fine, leagues ahead of anything Netflix generally makes (I have no idea why theirs is uniquely bad).Comedic theme works well with the over the top violence and gore.I'm not a huge fan of the Bethesda Fallout games but they managed to water down their already watered down take of the original IP.Not that that is it's worst quality - that is easily the lack of pressing (character) stakes.Only worth your time if you're really bored.
0	As an aged movie gal, i was so bored. Why do I want to watch a documentary / or a vague version of the real deal. And... I am sorry whoever the guy lead was... Has nothing on Matt damon and whoever else was in it had nothing on Jude Law. If you are a younger version of ME...as I am sure all if not most of the people reading this are... watch the real deal..old school movie. I loved the gal, but...the whole story was not even present. And all the reviews of it being fab... I am so sorry I do not see it. Phillip seymore hoffman was amaz in the first one.. as were all the charachters... I was like what is happening..am i in the twighlight zone? I was VERY dissapointed and struggled to see the point of this show...why redo a amazing movie that was perfect... it was just weird. I would be embarassed, to say this was good... i keep hearing all the folks say its amazing... do i need glasses... prolly. And sorry... if i offend people. But cmon.... dude who was Matt Damons charachter...did not hold a candle.... not even a crusty old charcoal piece....the ones in a fire after it rains.. ugh. I mean so annoying. As I said i dont mean to offend...but im kind of...or very salty about the whole situation.
0	There's a couple of things I'd mention:1) The characters: I really liked - and disliked - several characters and performances; they have the whole range. But Tyrion was brilliant, and Jorah also stood out to me. Jon Snow was very well developed throughout the seasons. He evolved in a very coherent way, at just the right pace. I'd been missing a hero for the first few seasons, and he clearly became it. Daenerys was very irrelevant to me, despite her obvious importance in the story. I just wasn't feeling her. And by the end, I couldn't stand her.2) The porn: Sex scenes and nudity are used generously, and also randomly - it seems - in the show, for the sole purpose of spicing things up.3) The meaningless story lines: The show seems to have quite a few and felt slow and boring in a lot of parts.4) The ending: Made me glad I binge watched the series and didn't invest 8 years on it, only to feel so unsatisfied by the end. It was still 8 seasons of my time, though. And a story with a bad ending is just a bad story. Nothing made sense, nothing felt right. I hope they do release that Jon Snow spinoff, and make up for their mistakes.
0	Season 7 broke the show, season 8 killed the show and not in a good way
1	The Rookie is fast paced, always interesting, the right amount of action/drama and these days it's rare but it has a Well written but before story! plus it has Nathan Fillan as the lead! But there are a few certain parts of this show that makes me mad and swear I won't watch the next episode. For one when a 100lb woman whoops a full grown felon in a fist fight and has him in cuffs in 10 seconds. I know that women are being portrayed as bad azz and strong these days but come on this is Completely Ridiculous how writers are writing women now young females are going to watch this and actually think that they can fight a male. And number 2 of things that ruin this show and Many other newer shows is that it is trying too hard to normalize homosexuality... it's in everything now and it's just feeling so forced! I don't have a problem with people being with whoever they want to be with but forcing your agenda down my throat is getting old and boring. I gave it a seven because it's a pretty good show overall.
0	So, so ,much awful writing.. takes away from great cast and some great potential story... Season 8 is NO exception... basically crap writing.... is what we can expect from the Game of Thrones. Lesson... don't create a series based on books and then try to write it yourselves after that... because you are not the writers and you will likely fall short.... Not planning to engage any prequel or future stories from these guys because they have proven they can't deliver. And I came back to take away another star for the concerted effort of using cast to attack show fans. SHAME ON YOU CAST & ALL FOR ATTACKING FANS for having feelings about the truly badly written season 8. You don't hide people in a CRYPT when fighting a boss that raises the dead.. you don't use a line of dialogue from a character(Jorah) to suddently make a character 'smart' that you have written into idiocy for many seasons.. YOUR STORY TELLING IN SEASON 8 SCREAMS YOU DID NOT CARE ANYMORE D&D!
0	Captivated by the talented cast, including Nathan Fillion, intrigued by the excellent writing & the action filled episodes THE ROOKIE has everything our family is looking for in entertainment. Using the body camera adds a new perspective to the police drama, putting the viewers into the show with the actors. The humor & the overall good feeling throughout the show makes us want to watch it even more. Please give THE ROOKIE a second season it's too good not to!
2	Possibly the toughest series I've ever watched, on so many levels - not least the fact that it's based on a true story.Really had little idea where it was going, and was expecting something quite light hearted, if I'm honest.Light hearted, it isn't.It's a great cast, and the acting is very good.I found it very difficult to like any of the characters at all - and going back to the fact that it's predominantly true - I found myself questioning some of the decisions that were made by the main protagonist.I also found myself wanting to watch some of the scenes (including the stand up routines) through my fingers.Episode 4 is particularly tough.All that said, it's totally engrossing, and brings some huge issues to the fore.
0	Well, we all noticed the decline after the 4th season.. but after what i saw in the 8th season, they are lucky i didn't gave them 1 star
1	This is one of the longest live running shows to ever exist. And it needs to be stop. The first seasons of this show are incomparable to any other medical show, the drama is so well laid out and gives watchers that same heart racing and sad moments. The show progressively falls of the rails, specifically after Season 11. If you dont want to ruin the experience of this show; end it at Season 11. It is a peaceful and enjoyable ending. If you would like to continue, I'd suggest preparing yourself for disappointment after more disappointment. The same plots of drama get boring and theyre ends up being barely any original characters left. ABC, please end this before you ruin its legacy.
2	I'm wondering why so many reviews mention the liking of the John Malkovich interpretation of Thomas Ripley in the movie of that name, yet not once do they mention his portrayal of a different character in this adaptation of The Talented Mr. Ripley in the last few scenes of this production. They have great things to say about this version and they enjoyed the Malkovich movie but don't mention he appears in this new one, why? I can only think it's because they didn't actually watch it until the end, because he doesn't appear until very near the end? Seems like a very odd thing to leave out of their reviews!
2	I enjoyed watching this show episode by episode and I knew it needs a season two more than any other show I have watched. I do fear that the story could burn itself out and leave a lame stale taste in the audience if the writers try to extend the series for too long. But, in terms of screening, the show is intense with Japanese war lore decorating the grips fantastic. The communication between the foreign and the Japanese is well given making the story more full of flavor with a entertaining edge rather than a busted language barrier. The tension between the characters is surreal which gives the audience a sense that the story is actually happening rather than a scripted play. If your into the culture of the samurai or Japanese war cultural history, this is a must watch. I hope season two is just as gripping.
0	GoT used to be the show I couldn't wait for but now i find it stale, repetitive and the story just isn't moving forward since the end of season three. Gratuitous violence doesn't bother me if the violence portrayed is integral to the story or helping to move it forward but now its just shock and awe meant to appeal to the simple minded. Season 5 droned on for 7 damn episodes of nothing really happening other than rape, attempted rape, watching a small girl scrub a floor till she goes blind, barbequing another small girl, more small girls get tortured by a pedophile in a brothel and the queen is forced to walk naked through the streets (wow, martin and/or the show writers must really hate women). I get that the writers want to have intrigue and develop the political story but they squeezed all the action into the last three episodes and then it was so predictable, Stanis dies, Jon snow dies (everybody likes him so of course he has to die), Jamies daughter would die, Kalesi's flying fire chicken would save her and despite it all the story has barely moved anywhere in five seasons.GoT is one of the highest production value shows ever made without a doubt but if HBO seems intent on relying way too much on a set recipe of shock and awe, naked people, over the top violent situations (not necessarily violent scenes) and making the audience guess which key characters are going to die instead of an actual progressive story that people can remember from season to season I'm gonna tune out just from pure boredom.Actually I think I'm done with this crap show, I won't support shows written by pedophiles. Seriously anybody who writes that much sadistic sex and bad things on women into a story should be checked up on by the police. Red flag anybody? Ramsey Bolton should peel the skin off the parents of the child actors for their greed to allow their kids to participate in such scenes. I know they're actors and it's a TV show but they are also children! For Christ sake HBO, pushing the envelope doesn't mean abandoning the last vestiges of human morality for the sake of ratings.
2	The writing has improved and the cast has seemed to gel. I have it on my watch list. Nathan Fillion has a solid TV presence and Eric Winter has become the TO you love to hate. And I want to see where the Titus Makin Jr. character goes.
1	"This series is both dark & compelling. The acting is absolutely spot on & I really loved Jessica Gunning (Martha) for her protrayal of his deranged stalker. There are also some gaping holes in the story, & unanswered questions which I wont go into as this will make the review far to long. What it does show is the super low level of police complacency when they failed to act when he first reported his stalker. Anyway back to the series. The first 3 episodes are stunning, but I felt it lost it's way somewhere in the middle. Donny's monolouge from episode 6 was good but far too long. Also this is supposed to be taken from a real life viral monolouge he did which is now nowhere to be found on the internet. The acting is terrific, but creepy. Almost verging on horror movie ""creepy"" but this is keeping with the story. Also this is quite depressing & perhaps not something you should watch if your feeling down. The main character is supposed to be a comedian, but there is little to no comedy in this, however if you are in the right frame of mind ""Reindeer"" could be a really enjoyable show. As for me I am on the fence with this one. I loved the acting, pace & even the story, but it was a little too depressing for my tastes."
2	The series began with five people who walked into a room that would change their course of life and it started with them being surgical interns and how they grew into great doctors(oh the show is a medical drama).It is a critically acclaimed show for its specialty in playing an orchestra in people's emotion and being really good at it.There are lot of other shows that explains the perspective of the bad guy or the perspective of the good guy saving the day but this show is different in its core.They tell the story in terms of emotions caused by others to the main characters and how would they react to those actions caused by others. Emotions,a powerful word.Basically humans have four emotions which they display when something significant happens to them or to someone around them.These emotions leaves a lasting effect on them.I can personally vouch for them as can you with the things that has happened to you.So it may look simple or feel simple but this show makes it a point to prove how emotions are important and how different people handle them differently.paul96.org/GREY'S ANATOMY-The Emotional Orchestrapaul96.org/MEREDITH GREY-A Sacrificial Surgeonpaul96.org/DEREK SHEPARD-The Magnificent Mcdreamypaul96.org/CRISTINA YANG-The Confident Chickpaul96.org/ALEX KAREV-A Robust Individualpaul96.org/MIRANDA BAILEY-A Meticulous Mentorpaul96.org/GREY'S ANATOMY-Other Characterspaul96.org/GREY'S ANATOMY-The Best Episodes

0	"If they really wanted to do these episodes, they could have done their own original ones instead of ruining my favorite book.I just talk about one thing: why the characterization of Ye is so SIMPLE, FLAT, AND STEREOTYPED! A female scientist who was supposed to be rational appeared irritable, emotionally exposed, and unrestrained in TV drama. What is touching is that Ye has not given up the ability to love her lover despite all the blows, and she still hopes that human beings can get better. She wanted to light a bonfire of civilization, but in the end it got out of control. That's why I like her, and even though her mistakes lead humanity to hell, I still don't want to define her as a simple ""villain"". Especially Ye's two ""loves"" made out of nothing, I think it's really hard to comment. I won't go into it, after all, I have to respect different people's views on ""love"" and respect the ""species diversity"" of human beings, so those who love to watch it just enjoy it.TV drama can, of course, be creatively adapted from books. And I don't care what the actors look like or whatever it is, but if they can't figure out what the theme of the book is trying to say, don't piggyback on it.By the way, if you really like this TV drama, stick to your own ideas and leave me alone. Hope you have a nice day, enjoy your episodes, and may God bless you."
0	The story started great. Loyal to the books (1-5). But (a enormous BUT) the final season is an insult, not only for the story (that GRRM has not finished) but to the spectators, tv entertainment and also to the characters itself. Don't see it. Is not worth the time. If you don't believe me, just read the final seasons comments.Breaking Bad is still the best serie ever.
2	This is my only one problem whit this tv show, but this is really very unreal to me
0	"Some decent moments in the first few episodes I guess. Doesn't take long to realize it's an awfully written, low-IQ social ""justice"" platform. This one is particularly egregious, reproachable, and offensive. Shows like this make the matters they seem to care about worse. Some decent moments in the first few episodes I guess.

0	I will start with casting. All the young lady officers look alike. This makes it very difficult to keep the characters straight as you watch the show.Second, the show is too much about their personal lives and not enough about police work - it plays more like a soap opera than a police drama.Finally, the back ground music is annoying. I realize there has to be a musical score in television and movies, but it is not necessary to vocals in the background when the audience is trying to listen to dialogue.
1	I'm not 100% sure which season it was, either 14 or 15, Shonda stepped down as the shows director. It's noticeable in the show because it's the moment when it slowly starts to decline into woke nonsense before it inevitably starts diving into the shallow end of a woke pool head first.I loved this show. I've seen it I think 4 times now. It's unwatchable now and it breaks my heart.

0	There couldn't be a more gaping hole between the writing of the show in the early seasons vs after the show writers had to do their job when running out of source material from the book. This show was the highlight of my week before season 7, and up until that point my excitement already began to fade as the show started catering to fan service, subverting plot expectations for no other purpose than just that, and making events that shouldn't be possible, possible, and expecting us not to notice. Themes, foreshadowing, and plot setups that were planted for years are thrown out the window. What made the show so great is now gone as the final season wraps up in one fell swoop of disappointment.
2	I am admiring the serie so much due to its captivating story and good acting of Japanese actors.The serie depicts a nice historical decade of international expansion governed by Portugal and Spain , as well as their conflict with Great Britain to master the lands and divide them.The hero of the serie acted talently to show the character potential and inteligence to save his life and the Japanese kingdom. He adapted the Japanese political rules and traditions cleverly.The sences were fascinating and the cast was chosen wisely and reflects the Japanese culture. The custumes as well were designed perfectly and the colors used described the Japanese culture, traditions and it showed each character rank in the society.
1	Good show about an older guy who decides to become a cop in LA. Of course, he's a liberal so guns are bad, killing terrorist is bad, one of the seven main characters has to have jazz hands with a few more introduced every show. Overall a good show when it can get away from that agenda. The storylines are believable. The characters are well developed. They should do more jokes about FIREFLY. Fun stuff
1	I had no idea this series was based on some books, and actually didn't find that out until reading some reviews here after I had finished all eight episodes (I typically will watch a show/series, formulate my opinion, and then read reviews to see how my thinking stacks up).The show started pretty slow, but still kept my interest to continue watching. For the first three episodes the writing was pretty tight, though it continued to move rather slowly. The next two episodes were pretty poor as the writers got lazy. In addition to introducing some pretty big plot holes, they also decided it was time for some melodrama. By episode six, there was no holding back. The writing got so bad it was almost comical. More melodrama, more and bigger plot holes, and just plain nonsense. This pattern continued until the end of the season, which gave us a finale that did absolutely nothing. It was like they wanted to do ten episodes, but ran out of money after number eight, so the season just ended.
1	This started out great and Nathan Fillion is always pretty great. However, the realism is awful even by Hollywood standards. I watched 2 seasons and it was really laughable how every single episode had the rookies be involved in massive shooutouts and huge cases. Also, every bad guy has an automatic weapon and never hits anything or anyone.Then there's the normal Hollywood craziness with bullet proof car doors etc. And the fact that your every day patrol officers do the things that in real life specialized units and SWAT would handle.Great idea, but the execution is lacking. What started out as a pretty unique show quickly turned into yet another regular cop show.
0	"Atrocious, insulting, offensive to anyone with an above 70 IQ. After wasting 10 + hrs on this travesty we are left with zero resolution. Toranaga sacrifices all his friends for no reason for a ""secret plan"" that never even gets executed. There is NO final battle, you get a 15 sec dream sequence where Toranaga fantasizes about how he would win a fake battle that has not even been fought. And Blackthorne, Toranaga only kept him alive because... HE MADE HIM LAUGH. The entire series has about 30 seconds of collective action, not including the pointless ritual suicides. On top of everything, the entire show is shot on one set, if it was Japan, there was no need for them to even go. The same could have been accomplished on a sound stage. A few horrible overhead CGI shots do not make up for this. The entire show is a waste of time, take this as a warning and save yourself from this insulting drivel."
2	I binged this in one sitting, it is gripping from start to finish. I saw reviews saying it was a tough watch, but I didn't find it as tough as others said. It was indeed uncomfortable at times, but having knowledge of how survivors of sexual assault act, I think I was better prepared than most.Which brings me to the point of why this was such a good series. Survivors of sexual assault are not 'perfect victims'. No-one is a perfect victim/survivor like the media and the court system would have us all believe. Most survivors have a past that includes drugs, drinking too much, a fight or two, or something else. This is how perpetrators get off charges in court - the defence finds a typical human flaw/mistake in the survivors past and manipulates that mistake to have the court and media believe it was deserved, or they lied. Another tactic is to claim they exaggerated because they went back to their abuser time and time again. The reality of course, is that trauma impacts how the brain processes and makes sense of events. In sexual assault or domestic abuse, in order to make sense of the incident, survivors often return so that they can tell themselves if they chose to return, they are not victims. They can even convince themselves they consented, or it was their fault. Others convince themselves it didn't happen. This can be a way to protect themselves mentally, however it ends up with a cycle of self-destruct. They rarely act in a logical manner. Most importantly, other abusers can spot survivors a mile away, and this results in them being targets of multiple abusers in their lifetime.Baby Reindeer shows this pattern in such a raw and unapologetic way. I cannot commend Richard Gadd enough for being so honest about it. When his stalker 'Martha' meets him, he has already been sexually assaulted, and is dealing with the mental load of that. She clearly had a routine of testing out her next targets by pretending to cry and see how people react. 'Donny' (Richard) reacts in a way that only a survivor would - he kept feeling sorry for her and falling for her manipulations until he finally cracks and tries to set her up. Of course, this was her plan all along, and she records him and uses it to get the police of her back. This is a classic narcissist tactic. Domestic abusers do the same - they push and push and push, and when the survivor snaps, they record them, call the police, and then claim to be the victim themselves.Many reviews and social media posts have discussed how Donny is self-absorbed and stupid for going back to the guy who sexually assaulted him, and for contacting his stalker. Such people have clearly led a life in which they have had no experience of being targeted by a stalker or a rapist (or knowing someone who has), and their lack of understanding and compassion is not only disappointing, but ill-informed. I hope they live out the rest of their lives without experiencing it first-hand, but I will say, if you have no experience in such matters, keep the judgements to yourself and read the wealth of research conducted on this subject in the fields of Criminology and Psychology. 'Donny' is not atypical in his actions - and probably would have gone for help sooner had there not been so much stigma and incorrect judgments about such abuse in society (the same stigma being perpetrated by those complaining about his behaviour and saying he was stupid). The self-destructive behaviour and self-loathing that comes with sexual assault cannot be underestimated, and people need to have more compassion and stop perpetuating the 'perfect victim' myth. Society as a whole needs to work harder at reducing the stigma and preconceptions they have of survivors actions while they try and make sense of their trauma.
2	The producing team come with a great pedigree but could they have bitten off more than they can chew?Many of the choices they made certainly worked but some of their choices made no sense whatsoever. I've seen plenty of comments about how odd it is that scientists would give up at physics breaking, when new discoveries is exactly what scientists live for. This could have been better explained.I would have liked them to have explored Fermi's Paradox and the Dark Forest themes a bit more, and to explain why the Staircase Project was so important but the second series is well set.The world building was excellent and I was not disappointed by some of the set pieces, particularly the Panama canal incident. That being one of my favourite scenes in the novel.But when all things are said and done, I look forward to season two, however, this is Netflix so let's not get too excited yet!
2	This seems like bits and pieces of others sci-fy films. The squeaky clean girl goes roaming in the the post apocalyptic world looking for her abducted dad. Her naivete is unbelievable yet the exposure to the outside causes her to grow. Goggins plays a wild west cowboy ghoul bounty hunter but is he dead or what? This actor really brings star quality in all he does sort of like Jack Nickonson. Despite the usual gory blood baths, with poor character development. The world of a nuclear disaster makes for iinteresting material. Lucy the protagonist blithely just happens to walk into a town and finds trouble she does not understand. At every turn aome one rescues her. A weird choice of 50's technology is featured. Metal armored suits , all kinds of mercenaries , and hidden orders battle to gain supremecy. The soundtrack is horrible takes away from the films ambiance. It gets better it grows on you. Hope for season 2.
0	I'm in love with the first two seasons, but the third? No way. I think anyone (no matter who you voted for) can agree that writers brought it a little too far.Have you ever met a police officer who thought their job was easy? Especially with this blm mess going on? No.These people put THEIR LIVES on the line for you. I just really hope Nathan Fillon finds himself in a situation where he needs cops, and either they don't come, or he realizes that this whole thing is idiotic, and honestly childish.I mean come on. If you sit around all day, writing a show, don't you think you'd at least thank someone that risks their life? Someone who is the reason you can even write your show in peace?If I really wanted to learn about this stuff, don't you think I'd be watching the news, and not a cop (the people these blm supporters hate) show? Probably.If you haven't watched the third season yet, I would recommend skipping it.I just really hope they don't make season 4 anything like the third.
0	"While the series is supposed to focus on the life of surgical interns/residents in a teaching hospital, about half of the story line for each episode emphasizes promiscuous sexual encounters among the various interns/residents and attending staff members. For example, Meredith Grey and Derek Shepherd had an affair before finally getting married; Lexie has affairs with Mark Sloan, who in turn has affairs with just about every female working at Seattle Grace Hospital, including Callie Torres, a bisexual. Izzie had an affair with Karev before the two were married, then she left him and sought a divorce. Cristina Yang was Burke's live-in girlfriend and almost married him, then after he left, she took up ""residence"" with Owen Hunt as his paramour. And then there's homosexuality: Callie Torres first had a lesbian relationship with Erica Hahn, then with Arizona Robbins, and in one episode, a female patient manifested erotic pleasure when Torres held her hand. The series depicts an underlying atmosphere of decadence and depravity, which undoubtedly contributes to ""high"" ratings and reviews."
1	The series has many characteristics of a good series. The new and creative story is the most important feature of the series. Scientifically, creative ideas can be seen in the series. Of course, the series has some weaknesses, one of which is the way to communicate with space aliens, and another problem is the technology attributed to space aliens, which is not believable for the viewer. There is also a lack of excitement in the last three episodes of the series, which is followed by a certain excitements and ends without results and without stimulating the viewer to wait for the next seasons.
1	The beginning season were amazing!! Great actors with interesting storylines, it had the perfect amount of humor and heart to go along with the brutal cases brought into the hospital. But then it started to lose it's heart, characters became extremely annoying, and the personal issues of the characters became exhausting as they never seemed to change. Grey's Anatomy had a great cast to start with, then they took those characters and slowly made them unbearable to stand. While eventually getting rid of some of the best actors on the show to replace them with people who you will not be able to tolerate for very long. I wish this show would focus more on the medicine aspect and less on the personal lives of the doctors. It would be nice if they would clean up the cast and get better actors with better storylines or just end the show! 15 seasons is a bit much.
2	This is more like 10 short movies rather than a television series. Beautifully filmed in some stunning scenery. Japan is a very beautiful country on the small or big screen.I can vaguely remember the original television series when I was growing up but I can't recall if it was actually any good. This version of the same book is a bit of a slow burner and yes there are subtitles. Lots of subtitles. I guess 90% of the dialogue is Japanese which is great for and obviously authentic but be warned you will be reading quite a lot of dialogue.No plot spoilers here so you'll just have to go and watch it for yourself. If you like films like The Last Samurai or The Seven Samurai then I think you'll love this. Epic storytelling for the small screen at its very best.
1	... I mean , i like the show , it´s entertaining enough not to check the phone too much , it´s well acted that´s for sure ... BUT it´s a little over the top with the shootings i believe . I know LA is a violent city and all , if we´ve learned something from GTA ... How come senior officer did only took his gun out once in his career and rookies goes around like it´s in Afghanistan ? It serves the purpose of the action of course or maybe i´m wrong and LA is really that messy .
2	As a preface, I haven't read the books, but I have watched the full Chinese series.I was reluctant to watch this version, but am glad I did. I thought this was, overall, a pretty decent adaptation. Not perfect by any means, but then neither is the Chinese version. I think the Chinese version does a great job of explaining the science and the reasoning behind the decisions better, but it lacks any real sense of dread and the present-day characters seemed a little bland. The US version also lacks that sense of dread, and also cuts out a lot of the explanation for certain decisions, but it does (in my opinion) have more rounded present-day characters, even though they are a little bit 'cookie-cutter'. This version also cuts out a lot of the 60s/70s back story , which I thought was one of the more interesting parts of the Chinese show, and helped lend weight to the main characters motivations.This version moves at a much faster pace than the Chinese version, which in some ways is good, but I think they blew the whole plotline too early. I would like to have seen more focus on the mental trauma caused by the slow realization of what was happening. A director like M. Night Shymalan who is very skilled at building dread would have been perfect for this project. I would also have liked to see a stronger focus on international co-operation and reaction to the events. It seems the whole world is ok with the UK making all the calls.All in all it kept me hooked enough to binge watch. I look forward to the second season.
0	Wow what a difference from last season. Now every sub story is about social injustice. I understand putting some social injustice in the story line but this is way way over the top. Every sub story is now about social injustice. Can we just have an entertaining show. It was well written series before the BLM movement this summer. But now I guess the writers feel the need to put his story line in every sub story in every episode. Yes I agree there is much social injustice, but we don't need to have this pushed on us every time we want to just watch TV. I live here in LA the home of Hollywood. I am a true So Cal native, so I understand but give me a break. We hear what you are saying but can you do a better job of writing and not make the message and agenda you are pushing so obvious? I would like to be entertained. ENOUGH WITH THE SOCIAL INJUSTICE story lines. Put it in but it does not have to be the point of every episode!!!
1	I know about Fallout, as I've picked up on it through cultural exposure, but never directly.This show makes me feel like I should at least play New Vegas! Because, while the visuals and execution are decent-to-good, it does a poor job at making me care about anything that's going on. From charmless actors with boring and unlikeable characters, horrible pacing and plenty of empty drawn-out moments... to dull writing, dialogues and interactions. No particular element grabbed my attention, and I felt finishing this show was a chore I had to get through.I'm saddened at the delivery of what seemed like a promising new show to watch.. but it reminds me a lot of all the problems I had with the later Westworld seasons, where nothing was particularly interesting.
1	"This show was a 10 to me until Season 8 Episode 2... The last 4 Episode of the show Ruined the other great 69 Episodes.. The Ending is So so Bad that i really wanna give it one but This show was ""the Greatest show Ever"" Until the last month.. I am So Disappointed that i have wasted 9 years of my life to see this sort of Ending. The Writers should be Ashamed of Themselves ."
0	I haven't the books but like most reviewers who did I didn't liked it. Not because of the useless love triangles or the cast. Complaining that auggie is too good looking to be a top scientist is borderline sexist and plain stupid. Even if they are far feom the majority you meet many young women in science university studies and they can be stunning or ugly just like in any other curriculum. Choosing a part western cast for an international oriented big budget TV show makes perfect sense, recently there not a single production without an Asian and an Indian to please local audiences for the same reasons... No I didn't liked it because it's boring and it tells a story that could have been told in one book or two but clearly someone wanted to milk the cash cows again.
1	"The series is based on a book. I remember the book was hailed as a.great accomplishment when it appeared and I put it on my to read list. However, after looking at reviews I decided to postpone it indefinitely. Needless to say, series in Netflix is an opportunity to find out what the fuzz was all about. It begins well and I understand how the opening sequences set in China during cultural revolution might be eye opening. I am not even sure whether any of that is even taught at schools. Maybe history classes are all on intersectionality? Who knows. In any case, from there the series deteriorates rapidly. We encounter supposedly top scientists of Great Britain if not the world. I do not know whether dialogues were lifted from the book or were created for TV, but I can assure creators of the series that high IQ people do not talk like teenagers strolling through the mall in buggy pants and do not have emotional problems lifted from Friends. I also hate to break it to TC ""creators"", but smoking weed is not top pastime at CERN. The reason is prosaic, it is rather difficult for a stoned person to engage in modern physics. I suspect that operating a lift fork would be a challenge, but operating a cyclotron certainly is.At this point I actually stopped watching, but after few days I decided to ignore physicists cum deadheads licencia poetica and continue. That was a mistake. It became quite obvious that the whole story was conceived by teenagers and caters to younger viewers who still find the world of computer games more engaging than the actual world. Why highly advance alien civilization would use VR game to communicate information about their native world that could have been communicated within a brief paragraph? Note they are so advanced they have no problem typing in Chinese or Cyrillic. They can wrap half of the Universe into a single proton but their invasion plan is to hire Manson Family. I will be merciful and I will skip the soggy drama of terminal disease, which was probably added as in teenage mind it looks profound. No, it is merely.sentimental and wastes valuable screen time that could be otherwise use to clarify many plot holes.Finally a warning. There are open ended plot lines. Given the quality of script writing it might have been by neglect, but what worries me is that a sequel might be in the making."
0	This season is just unbelievable. You put covid and to top it off you put black life's matter into it? I watch a tv show to escape reality. I LOVED greys up until this season.
2	Seriously? 2 great seasons and now this?? The show isfor entertainment and NOT to push the current bs narrative.
0	I admittedly stopped watching this show in season 10, but feel I invested enough time to still leave a review. This show started out so good, well developed characters, heart wrenching storylines... but once the main characters started to leave, the show was over. But Ellen Pompeo continues to drag this show through the battlefield of fallen characters, every natural disaster you can think of, and every hairbrained medical mishaps on this planet and the next.
1	I've played Fallout 3, New Vegas and gave up completing Fallout 4, so I'm familiar with the universe, but not a die-hard fan of the franchise.On the whole, I enjoyed the show. It does a great job of presenting the world I know from the video games, capturing the tone, the art style and even some of the humor that made the games such a great experience. There's an atmosphere to the show that is instantly recognizable to any gamer who spent time in the wasteland. Special effects are quite good, and there's a density to the set design and props that makes the world feel more real and lived in.Acting ranges from decent to excellent. Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins stand out, and are able to overcome some fairly campy dialogue to deliver performances that are both memorable and fun to watch.Unfortunately, I feel like the show stumbles with telling a compelling story. There are several instances where the plot develops a little too conveniently. Characters just happen across each other at the exact right time and place for the story to progress, with no explanation given. There are also a couple of writing choices where my suspension of disbelief went right out the window. Most importantly, when I finished episode 8, I still didn't have any idea of what the story was really about. What point were they trying to get across? Why did they make this show in the first place? As with most new media these days, it felt a little like they wanted to make a show around a familiar franchise, and then hired some writers to accomplish that, rather than starting off with a burning desire to tell a Fallout story.All in all, it's an entertaining watch, but it's not a 10 out of 10 experience as many here seem to suggest. If you moderate your expectations story-wise, you'll have a good time with Fallout.
0	This was not good. I haven't even seen the talented Mr. Ripley so I am not being influenced. The story, what there is of it, is that a rich playboy won't come home so his rich dad hires some acquaintance of this son to convince him to come home. But said acquaintance is not exactly a nice person. Agree that Andrew Scott is all wrong for this role. He comes off as completely the sketchy person he is. (and the first scene gives away the ending so you have no doubt). Right now he is being pushed by Hollywood so he gets this role even though he isn't right for it. The black and white does nothing to help the story and only screams pretentious (and I think it actually makes Scott look older). But for me the real problem is that there isn't enough story here to make a series. The first two episodes were intensely slow and drawn out. Even hitting the fast forward button a lot I felt like they were really puffing the story out. This is everything wrong with Hollywood today. Take a previously done story, do it wrong, make it longer and cast people you want to push.
2	Don't get me wrong, I love the show until season 16. I am also an extremely left leaning European but the lessons in each episode are too in your face. People are not dumb. Not every injury must be tied to some lesson etc. Plus it's extremely hypocritical that they're still celebrating people in the army as if they are heroes when in reality they're just pawns infiltrating countries that literally don't need them there.I'd love to see some episodes go back to the old style of giving life lessons etc.I am not opposed to some wokeness but it needs to be toned down and done in a bit of a smarter way.
2	As a huge fan of the books - I can confidently say I genuinely enjoyed watching this take on the popular Three Body Problem series.If you come in expecting an exact replica of the books, you already have set an unrealistic expectation considering the amount of build up, scientific knowledge, and character development in the first book.They make major changes such as the main character being a woman, while it's a male in the book - with some liberties in other things like pacing and timing.Everyone I know who has NOT read the series has praised their enjoyment of the show. I myself, thoroughly enjoyed their take on book 1 and seriously cannot wait to see The Dark Forest adapted soon. Netflix did a good job with this one!
1	I've watched the original mini-series and have read the book twice. I'm more a fan of the original because it included narration for context. I find myself reading captions at the bottom of the screen instead of enjoying scenery or the actors. I'd re watch this series completely once I get through all episodes. I might even purchase the original with Richard Chamberlain. This review is much longer than it needs to be because there's a six hundred charactor minimum. A feature that is completely useless and unnecessary. So I keep trying and trying but it won't let me submit it. Nope, just tried again but it's not happening.
1	"I got into The Rookie a couple of years late, so I binged Season 1 and Season 2. I liked the show. It's not as good as ""Southland"", but it was a nice, inoffensive, standard LAPD drama, with the charm of Nathan Fillion carrying the show.Oh but then Season 3 hit. The show became a preachy, boring, heavy-handed wokefest. The writers treated every white character, ESPECIALLY Officer Nolan, as racists or idiots. It was a nonstop browbeating for the entire season. And the ratings plummeted.Imagine my surprise when Season 4 started, and there was no more Titus Makin, Jr. In the cast. Imagine my surprise when the entire ""Nolan goes to law school night classes and gets browbeaten about white privilege"" storyline is just gone. Not a mention of it. No, now Nolan wants to be a TO, and not a detective. The first two episodes have been an action movie rescue plan to get Lopez from La Fiera, and a Tricia Helfer as a hottie master thief in tight outfits plotline.The fanbase hated Season 3. Now the showrunners are trying desperately to save the show so they can get through Season 5 and get into syndication.GET WOKE GO BROKE."
0	"A mildly entertaining story, very loosely based on the book.Choice of limey old England was unfortunate as its a downer for many viewers, doesn't make much sense given UK's current irrelevance, and significantly deviates from the original story. I understand most of the intended audience has a low tolerance to reading subtitles, and having a Chinese cast speak English would have maligned our perpetually maligned auntie, but why go for UK? There's more interesting & relevant Anglophone countries to base it in... even SG would've made more sense.Despite the setting & goofs, the story is still engaging up to around mid-season, by then the mystery is revealed and it becomes a bit of a slog. Acting was occasionally funny, but the characters 1D, tiresome after a while. Actors felt like actors pretending to be scientists without having lived in the role 1st. Relationships between characters also felt forced & unnatural, with only a couple of exceptions.Goofs include the unfolding proton thing, which is essentially magic, and like most magic in stories it suffers from the writer's lack of imagination on how it would be used, and inconsistencies in its stated logic, for example how it reflects a skylit ground after blocking the sky... and if it could reflect/block light at that scale, why not use it to attenuate sunlight back home? Regardless, if these protons could alter vision and computer storage, they could swiftly end the careers of anyone much more effectively & secretly than spooking them with a countdown. Magic + lack of imagination never works, stick with hard sci-fi instead.The show has many references to superstition, including modern ones brought to us via scholarly grift: ""what if columns of my spreadsheet were alternate realities?"" or: ""I can digest your lunch while digesting mine if we entangle them""... I'm surprised they didn't chuck in the ""we're all noodles"" thing, though they did mention how colliders produced 'wrong' results, which are then blamed on a deity - a viciously funny in-joke, but I doubt it was intentional. Other goofs generally reveal the age of the show's creators, like sitting in a car using an SLR camera to surveil someone, or the constant smoking.Vfx was poorly directed: milky lighting, white sky + sunlight, over-comped, weird camera & timing that screamed ""now here's a vfx shot"". The comical slicing scene was especially disappointing given how eerie it could have looked.Don't remember the Music."
1	I started watching this show about two years ago and thanks to Netflix I've been able to binge. I enjoyed the series a lot up until season 10. Then it started to get a little old, but still watchable up until season 14.Now it's a total train wreck, the writing is horrible, the characters don't have the same connection as the previous ones and it's a show that focuses mainly on being politically correct and not in a good way. I watched the most recent episode and 2 main characters who were previously in the military and dealt with the horrors of war became so stressed out that their four year old boy wanted to be called a girl so they need to see a therapist to help them come to terms with it. 🤷‍♀️I ended up giving it a 6/10 because of the first half.
1	"Ok, some parts of this series are excellent. The acting and cinematography are top-tier and deserve all the high ratings. That is really where it stops for me though. The rapist basically gets rewarded for being a scum bag and suffers no consequences for his abhorrent actions. Donny puts Martha in jail for stalking and harassment (due to being mentally ill) but then he goes back to the rapist(who is actually evil) and agrees to work for him again?? What exactly is the message here? The part I found the most meaning in is that after being raped Donny struggles with his sexuality and I feel the show portrayed what is probably a common thing for men who have been sexually assaulted in a heartbreaking, yet realistic way. I also really liked the scene where he tells his parents about the abuse and his father asks ""Would you think of me, as less of a man?"" Teri is so lovable, and it was easy to understand why Donny fell head over heels.What I really don't understand after finding out this show is based on the writer's real experiences is what did he intend for us to learn from this series? That after you are abused you will find massive success by going back to your abuser? That if you find yourself being stalked you should see it as a good thing because somebody finally loves you? After finishing the series I just feel empty, besides a strong dislike of the person who Donny is based on."
1	Well I guess everything was going fine until season 7. And then the writers went on drugs to create the worst last season in the history of TV.
1	One of the best TV-series of all time turned to one of the worst by bad writing in the last 2-3 seasons, the same time when the series surpassed the books.A such complex tree of character storyline can't end in any other way than disaster if you rush the end. And that's what happens to this show. It is like the series went for a nice and slow walk in terms of tempo the first 5-6 seasons and then turned it to a 100 meter sprint. Character development down the drain.I do recommend watching with a warning of disappointment. The first seasons are like nothing else after all.
1	"So after episode 4 this is my final review:This Shogun adaption just feels wrong, way too often. Diverting from the source and adapting a story to a modern view can be a good thing, if done right. In this case: It's not done right. And you almost get the impression, that all the good stuff was cut after filming.Switching from muskets training for the regiment to cannons? An ambush with cannons? The Napoleonic Wars? Come on. Cannons in feudal Japan wouldn't be possible, they had virtually no roads and no way to use them in land wars. But hey, it looks cool, so why not?And remember in the book, Blackthorne being outraged after the offer to ""pillow"" with a man? Guess what: That's gone in the FX Adaption. Blackthorne now merely shakes his head and gives a short remark. That's all.Honestly, Disney and FX are going way too far in their censorship of the story. Yeah, the story that takes place at the end of the 16th century. By that time, there wasn't anything like political correctness in the teachings of the Pope.Or maybe that's what the makers of the show mean, when they talk about a modern adaption of the book. I'm sure, James Clavell would die of shame if he wasn't already dead.Shogun by James Clavell isn't a book easily adapted as an TV-Show, and FX did an overall good job. The visuals are stunning, the music is good enough, and the actors aren't bad at all. Sadly, the actors in some key roles could do a lot better, though. Anna Sawai isn't really a good fit for Mariko, if you imagine the well refined woman you read about in the book. But that's something one can live with.The real problem is the kind of loveless adaption of the minor details from the book. Blackthorne walking by the prisoners being crucified or how dehumanizing being pissed on really is for Japanese people - all those important cultural clues are missing in the show.It's a good show, don't get me wrong, but it could be a lot better. So, if you haven't read the book or have never seen the '80s Miniseries, I guess you won't be disappointed."
1	I'd give it 10 stars for the first maybe 10 seasons. This show used to have so much heart. I cried every episode! Great characters and character development. The stories they told about all of the patients added an emotional impact with every episode along with the main casts storylines. Now the patients stories and main characters storylines feel like fluff. Once all the main cast was gone it was all down hill from there. It's sad this is one of my favorite shows. I still rewatch it but I have to stop around season 10 because it becomes unbearable to watch. It doesn't have the same heart that it used to.
2	"We love the show until the concentration on Rosalind. Get past the serial killer. Who likes to think about them anyway, go back to the every day stories. Not really fond of the new rookies ""feelings"" about cases. Get a new rookie or rookies. Feelings have no actual place in actual police work. Started watching the new Feds Rookie spinoff. It is growing on us. Reign in the cleavage though. Her charm and humor are really all that's needed. She's a funny comedian. Rely on that. We like the characters crossing over between the shows. Nolan and Bailey need to take the next step. What happened to Nolans son?"
0	The first couple episodes are interesting, the more the show goes on the more boring it becomes. I had to fast forward almost every dialogue through episodes 5-7, at least half the screentime in these episodes was dedicated to drama between Blackthorne and Mariko which is the most dull and tiresome part of the whole film.The whole political power struggle can be interesting but sadly it's not flashed out enough, and then again, the show just tumbles down into weird family drama instead of continuing with the scheming councilours and profit-seeking Portugese. Even though the scheming we are shown also has some flaws, some events/plot twists don't make sense and even made me laugh.There is VERY little action in the show, almost none of it. There is still hope for the episodes to come, but as for episodes 1-7 there is basically 1-2 fighting scenes... in a show about feudal Japan and the samurai.As for the technical part, the costumes, scenery, athmosphere and VFX overall are good. Almost all dialogues are on Japanese with English subtitles, and it can be a little off-putting after a while, even though it is somewhat understandable because we are shown a dispute between the Western European and Japanese cultures.The acting in the film is decent, not horrible but not a masterpiece either.Overall, the show (so far) is mediocre at best, and feels like a lot of wasted potential. There are some cool scenes, ideas and characters, but it is definitely not the 10/10 show as many proclaim.
0	I was invited to watch it with a whole advertisement on social networks. But after watching the first three episodes, I decided not to continue watching it. Because I feel that the children who have suffered for ten years voted for it out of excitement, not those who have been following the cinema for several years. All this advertising and noise for a scenario similar to the third-rate Korean series (jumong) with special effects that should not be at the level of a score above 9, but these special effects are fair in the range of a score of 6. The black army in the movie is very weak and amateur. I hope you will not be fooled by the score without technical support like me. The actual score of this series is 6.
0	"Downey Jr can act and has money, so he should have given other actors a chance like Mel Gibson and Favreau gave him..he looked ridiculous playing all those different characters with make up, I'm surprised he didn't put on a wig and makeup to play Sandra Oh's character. As for the captain, I can barely understand his Vietnamese and he's too young to play a captain and looks nothing like Eurasian and those contact lenses didn't help...why would they let a Korean director (Park) direct a Vietnamese series? He can barely speaks English and definitely does not know Vietnamese. Would you let a white director direct ""12 years of slave""? Tran Anh Hung just won best director at Cannes film festival and Victor Vu and Hoan Tuan Cuong have films on Netflix and there are other good Vietnamese directors... only a Vietnamese director would know how Vietnamese talk, our mannerism etc...it's a culture thing. The book is better."
1	Yes, I haven't played the game. I've heard of it, but I went into this completely blind. I had no background context and most definitely did not get any jabs to the game, but I did enjoy it. I found it was really well-paced, it didn't rush into anything and allowed me to understand the plot. Which I would've gotten almost instantly if I knew the lore of the game. I thought the costume design was great, and so was the set design. However, I found the dialogue between Lucy and Max extremely awkward and their romance was tedious, I don't think they had much of a spark at all. KYLE MACLACHLAN IS BAE!
0	And now a toddler banging on a toy piano. I was legitimately rooting for the undead. Please, please kill everybody. And then possibly me so I don't ever have to get my hopes up again for a promising fantasy show to close as strong as it started.
0	We started out really liking the premise and intrigue even though at first the show seemed like a Recycler at times, but the intrigue kept building for a few episodes and of course the cast was more than just a magnet for viewers, from Jonathan Pryce and Rosalind Chao to Benedict Wong and John Bradley. Sighh, unfortunately the premise is mired in some major plot flaws and by the end of the first season, with the finale, we find 3 Body Problem has some serious story telling problems, specific to the science fiction genre. Clearly many of you found it incredibly good and we invite you to challenge our full-blown review which identifies specific and major structural issues with this series. Be warned this is NOT The Expanse nor anything of the quality of that show. West Coast Midnight Run's editors felt the viewer could either be turned off at first or pulled in depending on your experience with science fiction tropes, movies and shows. You need to come over to get the major issues we identified with the first season. Don't be shy, our venues are open access and free and we love sci-fi fans.
0	As stated in the title, the first couple of seasons were amazing. They had the world watching every year and it was a phenomena that won't see again for decades. Not since Friends have we seen a show capture so much attention.But the show writers decided to squander all their hard work and good will by trying to wrap everything up within one season that should have been done over at least 3 so they could go to Hollywood and cash in by directing a Star Wars film. The karma came back around and they are now hated and never got their Star Wars film. Lol.So while the journey is fun, the ending is so truly awful that there's no point in wasting that many hours of your life. There's no point investing that much of your own life in to something you know will end so badly.
0	I kept hearing how good this was. So I was drawn in and watched it. It was good in part but, an alien invasion series with no immediate prospect of aliens invading was really the big twist. Once it was revealed the alien fleet was 400 years away it really took the edge off the suspense. That freed up time for hours of navel gazing by the main characters. Most significant of which was the angst following the destruction of the alien's acolyte's converted freighter. Since the plan must have been well discussed you would have thought the scientist would have realised what would happen if you put a giant super egg slicer in the Panama canal and ran a ship full of people through it.Add to that the made for tv level sfx and the only thing missing was an after the credits rendition of never gonna give you up the legendary meme for internet trolling.
2	I truly loved season 1-17. I am surprised at how much i have enjoyed a show and for 17 seasons even! After that, my favourite characters were mostly gone. Kepner, Calliope, Deluca, and more. The show keeps killing characters before becoming seniors (Edwards and Deluca) all of whom i would've loved to see grow. They kept ones like Wilson and Maggie??? Both the very annoying. With meredith gone and this new batch of residents it'll be reeeeeeeally bad. Hate these new baby residents. We have to watch another set of characters grow again from the beginning?? Making the same mistKes as the 2/3 sets of residents before them? No thank you.Also why the hell have Jo and Linc been in this unidentified and untouched love thingie for 3 seasons? The writers forget they exist and hint at their attraction for 5 minutes every episode.
0	I enjoy the show well enough at times. I like the characters well enough, even if they are pretty much the same thing you've seen a thousand times over. That's the kind of thing that can be improved with more time to build on them.That said, the writing is pretty atrocious. The writers clearly don't care about A) how police work actually works and B) how the real world actually works. I'll admit I'm far from an expert on the former (although there's still so much that I know is wrong). That said, I do know that someone won't be cleared for active duty within weeks of being shot in the chest (without a vest). I know that someone will not be walking around perfectly fine weeks after being shot in the face. I know that cops don't just walk into situations without making sure they have back up, especially when that leads to them brushing with death on a seemingly weekly basis. I know that Internal Affairs won't actually break the law to try to trip up cops, nor would they get civilians to break the law for them to try and trip up those cops.I'm not some perfectionist snob. I understand that fiction needs to take liberties some times. I know that TV shows need to ramp up the action to keep interest. I'm perfectly willing to suspend my disbelief in order to be entertained. But this show just goes way too far beyond that. It's a trend I've been noticing a lot lately with ABC shows. They go big and loud and fast and don't seem the least bit interested with details.If you're looking for some simple fun or you're here because you're a Nathan Fillion fan (that's how I got into this) then by all means give it a try. But for me, I just ended up not being able to stomach the painfully bad plot.
1	"It's entertaining enough to watch, but the cheesy boat scenes, generally bland dialogue and typically convenient dramatic events leave it lacking. The acting is good for the most part, but some of it feels forced due to the ""language barrier"". I may be ""old man yelling at clouds"" but the ""white savior"" thing is generally a little hard to consider, especially how easily everyone is in awe and captivated by easy manipulation and this is coming from a middle aged white man. There are some moments, so I guess, watch it, enjoy it for what it is, but definitely a show that you won't feel guilty missing out on."
0	"With all the bitching and childish behavior that goes on in this show anyone would expect it to be set in college, not in a hospital. With a great name like Grays Anatomy, one would expect a high premise of medical situations, procedures and indeed, the feelings of the doctors and patients within the hospital. We get none of this. Instead we get a bunch of grown adults acting like children. This is ( and should be classified as) a soap opera, not a ""medical drama"" as the network would have us believe.However, I am aware that some people enjoy petty squabbling between stereotypically pretty people pretending to be doctors by wearing white coats and steamy ""will they wont they"" situations arising between interns and residents. This show has all of that, with none of the complicated (or realistic) medical or hospital business to get in the way of a ""good"" juicy storyline.It really does seem out of place being set in a hospital. The characters don't act or speak like doctors and the hospital is just a backdrop for their petty squabbles or torrid love affairs.This show is saved ONLY by fairly decent acting from the main cast. However, I will add that none of them have any extremely notable charisma, they are just decent actors. If you want to see a good medical drama with real human emotions, comedy, love, friendship, etc...I suggest SCRUBS or BODIES. They're a millions times better."
2	Game of Thrones finally finished, the last episode aptly titled The Long Night and it was a terrible ending, disappointing for fans, causing a collective cringe around the globe.Best of all time and winter is coming.
1	I really tried to watch this with an open mind and without the inevitable comparison to The Talented Mr Ripley, a movie I rate highly and have watched several times. Admittedly I have not watched other versions or read the book. Unfortunately though, I simply couldn't help making the comparison.From word go in episode one I found this incarnation of Ripley jarring. He comes off as a middle aged grifter, without any sympathetic qualities, simply unlikeable. There seems to me to be no convincing reason that Dickie would immediately take into his home a man coming across as a loser, quite unlikeable and lacking any sophistication required to fit into those circles.Worse, the passage right up until Dickie's murder lacks any development of character or relationships to add any plausibility to the whole scenario. Throughout the movie Ripley simply comes across to me as a psycho, increasingly so, who lacks the qualities or skill to convincingly continue his deceptions.Hard to rate this one, and I'll give it 5 on its own merits as a reasonably binge-worthy series for a rainy day. But I think the casting was too wildly off to do the main character justice.
1	Straight of the bat you're thrown into the world of Fallout, and that intro is really, one of the best intros I've seen any piece of media. It's just a pity those initial scenes were so limited, sort of like the first sip from a cool Nuka-Cola.I wish I cared more about the characters and plot but they really just feel like 2D cardboard cutouts serving the purpose of tour guides to show us the world of Fallout. They do a really good job at this but as a result I they do little to make you care about them.There's also like zero original soundtracks for the show, relying on preexisting soundtracks which were heavily used in the source material, once again reinforcing the idea that the show is relying heavily on the fan service element.It has great action sequences and world building but beyond that, it leaves much to be desired regarding the world of Fallout.
2	I really like this TV show.It's one of the first shows i started watching and have since been watching.I like it because the cast is amazing,the plot is very interesting-although poor Meredith goes through a lot of things- and last but not least the show always gives you a life lesson.One of the things i don't like is that many characters are dead(especially the ones i was very attached to) and that i cry in every damn episode..
1	Well I'm really not sure what that was, but it was a bit surreal.Jessica Gunning as Martha was mesmerising and terrifying at the same time, but she played the part so well I had to look up her name to make sure she is just an actress.Richard Gadd was also very good, but I couldn't help thinking Donny was getting himself into his own situations, but at the same time I felt sorry for him because he was slowly losing his temper and his mind.Special praise from me goes to Nava Mau as Teri, I thought she was absolutely brilliant and so beautiful, I just wish she was in it more.So I've given Baby Reindeer a 7 because it was ok.
0	I didn't see Game of Thrones the first time around and finally thought I'd see what all the fuss was all about. Honestly, I can't get into it. Obviously it has a bunch of great actors in it, and at least some of it is visually stunning. But I'm not nterested to see beheadings alternated with sex every two minutes, especially when so many of the women are there half-clothed for male titillation and treated like property.I kept hearing about the complex characters and the wonderful plot lines--maybe I didn't stick around long enough. But the gratuitious violence and half-naked women put me off.
0	"I'm sitting here watching The ""Real Crime"" episode and it's one of the worst I've seen....enough so that I turned it off and deleted the show from my DVR list. Each season the show seems to get dumbed down more. I should have bailed after season 2. The characters are fine but the writing has declined."
0	Is it really that hard to make believable characters? Or, at least make them interesting? Clever? Strange? Unique? I felt like I was watching a mediocre 80's American family TV thingy, with better Hollywood graphics.Hollywood caricatures throughout...A young pot smoking dude (with glasses, obviously!), and his beautiful scientist ex-girlfriend, both never more than a few yards away from their hair and makeup artists hands...Some of the worlds top scientists, we're told. Radiating science dropouts nevertheless.E. T. Communicating by flashing all stars simultaneously in morse code at midnight.Dramatic music.And I'm presented with an action packed teaser from this seasons upcoming drama at the end of the first episode.I'm out.
1	I was immediately struck by the void of artistry in the direction and cinematography, particularly having watched 'Sometimes I Think About Dying' just before I started watching this (in which EVERY SINGLE SHOT looks like a beautifully composed photograph). It just seems like they flew through it as quickly as possible doing every scene by numbers. As someone who enjoys quality cinema this was an absolute famine for me.So, with nothing to enjoy visually you are left with the meat of the story which had interesting ideas but was a bit 'this happens then this happens then this happens' without any real intrigue or tension beyond 'so... what's the deal with these aliens? Maybe we'll get an answer at the end...' Everything seems to happen a bit too quickly without any real depth. I was interested enough to get answers to the questions but didn't really care about a single character, although the big bloke from GoT was fairly likeable and the show seemed to miss his charisma when he died as no one else had any.People seem to love this story enough that I have to believe there's more to it than what I watched so I am currently in the process of downloading the Tencent version.
1	"The latest, much-publicized science fiction blockbuster series is ""Fallout"", now streaming on Prime and Freevee (without and with ads, respectively; both are from Amazon). It stars Ella Purnell as Lucy MacLean, Walter Coggins as the mutant bandit ghoul, and Aaron Moten as love interest Maximus. While it is getting a high rating of 8.7 on IMDB I would rate it a barely watchable 6.0. The plot is that VaultTec, a manufacturer of fallout shelters, has conspired with other powerful interests to start a nuclear war in order to drive customers into its shelters. Some 200 years later the surface is inhabited by warring remnants of humanity as well as mutated monsters. This series is based on a popular video game and feels as juvenile as one might therefore expect in spite of its multimillion dollar production. It is not so much science fiction as it is one which is only a couple steps above being a zombie apocalypse film. There are all sorts of plot holes (e.g., how is it with surface obliterated back into the stone age, electricity seems to be working in every abandoned building and high-tech weaponry proliferates). Characters are stereotyped and inauthentic. I also wearied of combining ultraviolent visuals with retro nostalgic singing. I did watch all eight episodes but I think one must be a sci-fi or gaming addict to do so."
1	Every series has its end at some point. I wouldn't wish it on Grey's anatomy, but 16th doesn't make it easy. What bothers me most is the newfangled way of filming. The image moves all the time and things are filmed, like a table, which nobody is interested in. I write this review during the episode because I don't mind missing something, it's not allowed. Stay true to the classic Greys and don't experiment.
0	"It's a real consensus that the continuous off-voice narration it's a poor way of telling stories. Grey's anatomy it's not only a poor collection of female anxieties but the actual translation of Steel style pink novels to a TV screen. The only interest in the series is who's going to date this or that carachter.The medical background is weak and totally obscured by the love affairs of everyone inside the hospital, therefore closer to that one in ""Tootsie"" but without the sense of humor and the lovely situations.The closing credits are always preceded with a no sense speech of (sometimes) several minutes, trying to solve the lack of real abilities from producers, actors and directors to tell a story. ""House"" is miles ahead."
2	RIP GOT season 8 along many characters. To all the legendary seasons and episodes, last season did not do justice at all. Infact, its the worst season of the most epic season of all time. Producers: If you can remake season eight, that would be great.
1	By far my the most enjoyable book/TV series I have ever read/watched until the last season. GRRM must have had zero input as far as series 8 is concerned. It's terrible. 10/10 series 1-6. 0/10 series 7-8.
1	The first two seasons were good fun run of the mill cop drama with a twist. Season three has matured into a show that explores the political and social climate that the American police is operating within. It's a brave but necessary contribution to the conversation and is yet more evidence that the entertainment industry is finally taking responsibility for educating its viewers. Not surprisingly they're getting hate for it, but I hope it won't be a deterrent to continue this amazing turn that they've taken in making the show worthwhile.
2	Doing new things in a cop show is pretty challenging, and The Rookie has nailed it without moronic gimmicks or wacky characters.We spend enough time each episode with the minor characters to get to know them, while hanging out with the central ones long enough to give them depth - that's a hard balancing act in a 42 minute episode. So you actually care with the gruff TO has a junky wife, and Fillons rich college friend gets carjacked and mugged.Each episode has fun with itself with just the right touch of gravitas for what is after all life and death situations. This speaks to the quality of the writing and the pitch perfect delivery of the excellent cast.An interest blend of stories on the big scale and the small, this series delights in surprises while maintaining its credibility and refraining from overtly sappy set ups.Can't wait for the second season.
1	"Viewers deserved better than what the writers and producers gave them during the latter half of season 7, but much more so throughout season 8. The final season was rushed, as if the writers wanted to get this show over and done with while the finale was insultingly ridiculous.One main character's descent into madness in less than 2 episodes - having been perfectly sane for the preceding 70+ episodes - was comical, and clearly rushed. The writers had to know this was the direction the show was going long before those 2 episodes. They could have, and should have shown her descent into madness starting towards the end of season 7.But that finale? Neither of the 2 ""good"" lead characters got to personally kill the two of you know who ""evil"" characters?! Neither got to make them suffer?! They just get to die by ________ and that's that?!Screw you, writers.I've never seen a more anticlimactic ending for characters that loyal viewers deserved, no, were owed to at least witness them die as painfully and torturously as all their monstrous acts over 8 seasons combined.I can't even begin to address who ended up on the thrown. I have no words."
0	Not any soap opera, Indian soap opera with 4k episodes. I am sad for old people, they will never see the end. Casting had done bad job. Actress playing Meredith is terrible choice. Writers did terrible job with hers and Derek's love life. Not natural behavior at all. And the amount of whoring around that happens in the hospital is too much. I don't think I'l be watching it after 6th. Season. Imagine having coitus and during it you stop with out finishing it, that is how exciting is the show. As long as it makes money they wouldn't care.
2	I digged the ascetic. Love how they incorporated the sounds from the game so well. Idk how to describe it but like really super duper weird fun violence just like the game too. I would say it's on par with the Boys which is the best they could have hoped for. It's kinda lacking and some things do become more noticeable when you watch the show. Visual nothing special, did a good job and looks good for what it is. I thought the sets were good but you can definitely tell it was made on location, in studio, on multiple sets but it still looks and feels like Fall Out. Ella Purnell crushed it as, Lucy. Definitely a Vault Dweller where rules applied. When she goes out into the real world she is always looking at things from a logical less confrontational way, which naive in this world. The wasteland is just full of scumbags who have no morals, trying to survive anyway possible. Jonathan Nolan, Lisa Joy, & Todd Howard did a really good job of adapting this and I must say it feels like the game. I just want to set the right expectation this is not, The Last of Us. This is a super duper fun show and will most definitely keep you entertained.
2	A brutal and tragic tale of trauma, obsession, abuse, love and self hatred. Donny is a very bad comedian making ends meet by working in a bar. One day, an obese but chirpy lady walks in claiming she is a lawyer, but can't afford a drink. After about 20 minutes, I knew I was going to binge watch it. First two episodes fly by, but it suddenly takes a dark turn in episode 4 which is shown as flashback, and Donnys sexual feelings and vulnerability begin to make some sort of sense. But it is only at the very end, it all falls in place for Donny. She is gone, but he is spending all his time listening to her messages. He suddenly comes across one explaining why she called him Reindeer Baby - she had a cuddly toy of the same name, and it was the only thing that made her feel safe. They were both victims of sexual abuse, and just maybe they were lost souls, who could only relate to each other and nobody else in a bizarre way. He missed her despite everything. Maybe a Season 2?
2	The first two episodes were great and some of the best TV I had watched in the last couple of years. But, as it progressed, the show started to diverge away from the best aspects of the show- the feud and the politics. Now, the whole show has turned into a romance drama revolving around Blackthorne and Mariko. Things pertaining to Shogun are in the backdrop. I had to fast forward 5-10 minutes of an episode last week out of boredom. That's how stretched out the later episodes feel compared to the first two.I hope the next episodes would be better but have a feeling this will feel more and more like a family drama.
1	The way Game of Thrones pulls you in from the outset is a tremendous achievement in entertainment, to be sure. The narrative continues to churn and twist, flexing it's impressive potential pretty well right up to the end. Then the writing simply caves in on itself for one of the most disappointing finales you will ever see of any show of this caliber in which you could imagine investing 8 years of anticipation of what you could only assume, judging by the standards it sets for itself, would be a final, glorious, fulfilling conclusion to a sweeping epic. To give this series a 7/10 absolutely required that the first 7 seasons, and perhaps the first 6 episodes of season 8, merit a 9/10, because the finale in the last 2 episodes was, at a generous best, worth maybe a 4/10 or 5/10...at best. It truly felt like the writers had neither the tact nor talent to fulfil the narrative and bailed out in a panic, delegating the task to their children as a homework assignment. Considering the expectations and investment, this has to rank quite easily as one of the most disappointing endings to any kind of story that I have ever known. Pathetic.
2	I'm on season 2 at the moment it's a good show that keeps you entertained and guessing what is going to happen next
1	Last season completely destroyed this series. What a complete waste of time. The seasons leading up to it were great but most of the last season doesn't follow what they built. HBO should have fired the producers and given this story the ending it deserved. Not this trash.
2	"I Love Nathan and watched all his shows since Firefly. This show has a great plot/idea about an older man wanting to become a rookie police man and finding lots of strengths in many aspects of his job!However, some of the scenarios that they get put in can be a little crazy for regular cops lol! Other than that I love the connection all the characters have with one another but please for the love of god please change his love interest!! I can't stop laughing when I see tiny little Jenna wearing that heavy fireman equipment! And her acting is so bad! Please get rid of her!And I agree with other reviewers that are complaining about the show becoming too ""woke""...if I wanted to see/watch/talk about those issues I would watch the news, not during my favorite shows!Oh and by the way...would you please get Lucy and Tim to hook up already?! The chemistry between them is ready to boil over."
1	I did not read the books nor was I familiar with them. I watched the first couple of episodes on a plane flight and was kicking myself for not downloading more. I was extremely excited about the show and thought it had a ton of interesting and fun ideas / stories and potential. Watched episode 3 on the Uber home I was so in enthralled.Sadly, I finished episode 6, and am having to call it quits. It feels slapped together, lacking development and any depth, void of subtlety, character actions are nonsensical for no reason... massive events just happen with no lead up or planning or thought or emotions, and the love interest scenarios feel forced and uninteresting. I'll give that the benefit of the doubt though as maybe it actually does play some role in the plot later rather than just shoved in for no reason.Pretty bummed to have so quickly gone from falling asleep with thoughts about the show running through my head and captivating me, to trying to force my way through episode 7 before giving up and buying the books. Good way to sell some more books though!TL:DR - Awesome start, then fell off. Maybe more enjoyable with lower expectations and not thinking too hard about it.
1	Show is jumping the shark in season 5. More unrealistic situations like cars teetering on the edge of buildings and episode 10 an office drilling into the bottom of a vehicle to spray mace. The protocol for an LA cop would not permit these scenarios. The tie in with a the Feds show is annoying as Niecy Nash is the most unlikely person for this role. Not the least believable. The romance angle is unnecessary. Keep to police story lines. Nolan's role is reducing and is no longer the premise for the show. It was a good run for 4 years but I Can't see the show going much longer it's lost it's way.
0	I loved this show från the beginning and I really like Nathan Fillion. But not even he can carry this sinking ship. It went downhill fairly fast and now end of season 4 it's just a bunch a women who ain't that fun. All the main characters is pushed back and new really annoying ones taking over. Sorry but yet another show that caves in.
2	I love this show ! It's the one show that I can't wait for to air ! They have done a fantastic job
1	It's difficult to watch from what it could've been.A series based geographically in one of the most beautiful places of the world, and it's in black and white. What a waste.This series is filmed beautifully, acted exquisitely and edited beautifully yet set a foundation of frustration upon you. Ah, what it could have been.In colour, one can imagine the immense beauty and character this film would seep with. Instead, in its churned reserved stale visual reincarnation it's hard to look past it.Whether an artistic or directorial stubbornist, it finds oneself overlooking the beauty of the cinematography, the delicate acting and erudite dialogue: absolutely wasted. Instead it struggles to find a home in the concoction of art and mainstream streaming media.
1	Really loved this series.It's still visually stunning, the music is still breathtaking and the production quality overall is just mindblowing - except when it comes to writing. 7 seasons if storyline were butchered, including the main villain and basically all of the main characters. It wasn't a factor of me not agreeing or me not being 'happy' about it - they literally destroyed their storlyines and made them act like different people whilst all they, and therefore we had gone through, meant nothing. It's been extremely painful to see such decline in what was genuinely the best thing to grace television. I truly believe that.I'll still give it a 7. The first few seasons are without a doubt the best you'll ever see. But if you missed out or come across this in 10 years time when the next generation will find out about this phenomenon: know that the ending and the whole last season are an utter disappointment an ruin it all.
0	I honestly couldn't find a single redeeming feature myself, bar some good performances. I know, I'll be hung from the gallows for saying such, but I gave up half way through season 3 as I found myself just getting angry at all the characters. A footnote to some of the greats that went before, and inspired it.
0	I had to go back a few season because I stop watching it after Dr. Shepard died, and I realized one of the reason that irritates me. 2 WORDS...... CHRISTINA YANG!!!!! She was the MOST ANNOYING person on the show. I was soooooooooooo glad when she left!! I couldn't watch most of it because of her. She's the reason I rates it 7 Stars, because although it was a great show..... SHE RUINED IT FOR ME!!!!! I'm surprised this show is even still running. I'll try to get caught up so I can watch it again but I seriously doubt it!!
1	I don't know the games and I don't know if that's an advantage or a disadvantage (for judging the show) - anyway, the show offers solid entertainment with some funny moments, the production is top-notch for a TV show, and the cast is solid too. What annoys me the most is the soundtrack - not necessarily the music itself, but in my opinion, too many scenes are unnecessarily underscored with music that often doesn't fit what's being shown, and it sometimes really gets on my nerves - less is more so to say. Other than that, if you don't expect too much, you'll get well-produced trash without great aspirations: popcorn cinema for the right kind of audience - I enjoyed the ride but for sure Fallout is not a masterpiece like so many reviewers claim but way better than Halo or The Last of Us.
2	Andrew Scott gives a deeply neurotic and disturbing impression of one of the most beloved psychopaths in movie history. He's a great actor and he knows exactly what he's doing, sharp, precise, intense, on top of his acting skills.Zaillian stretches the story out here, (sometimes a little bit too much in the last three episodes), taking 8 hours, compared to shorter former versions. I must say I like all versions, because Highsmith's original story is of genius quality, and it allows to open a lot of doors to different interpretations. I loved Alain Delon in the Rene Clement classic, as well as Matt Damon in the luscious Minghella version, but comparing the different interpretations in detail would take to long.About this one: Yes, I loved that it was shot in atmospheric black and white (fantastic cinematography, every frame a piece of art!), I loved that this version was slow, I loved that it was so dark, I loved the sardonic humour.I could have easily given this version 10 stars, but, I am sorry to say, the characterization of Freddie Miles didn't work for me here.
0	If you don't see the last season of this series don't bother!2 years of waiting for this finale????? Are you serious? For my opinion stop watching the series at 7th season.4 stars for previous seasons only!
2	I am really glad that this adaptation wasn't ruined.I am a big fan of the games, and it brings me joy to see it go through.It is slow in the beginning with the world building stories, therefore for someone who comes from the game with knowledge about the world it can get boring.But it is done right. And after ep.4 I was sucked in and binge watched until the end.There are some inconsistencies, but they are easy to overlook for regular audience which is the target audience. But there are easter eggs and mentions for us folks.Acting is good, most of the times.Line up is perfect, as far as I am concerned and very well picked.Gore and action aren't over the top and blends in with the theme.Story is intriguing and captivating, and makes you crave more.They did a really good job with costumes and CGI which are good and in place.All in all, solid 9 and I can't wait to see the next season.
0	"This is ""Lord of the Rings"" meets ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Great production values married to a total gross-fest. Let's see (obligatory spoiler alert, of course) though there's not much to spoil since I'm writing this now for a show that's been on six years. Anyway, let's start. Brother and sister having sex while the latter is married to the king, passing off their offspring as his. Human babies being offered up to strange zombie-like creatures by a father who marries his own daughters. A torture scene involving rats, various body parts cut off, rape scenes, castration scenes, this is basically Saw movie levels of entertainment. I'll give some credit for the first season for at least being original, as well as aforementioned high quality production values, but after that (I watched season 2 as well on DVD, then looked up the rest via summaries on the Internet), and the basic theme doesn't change, really. It's basically what new kinds of shock scenes can they through at us without anything ever being resolved. Good characters are killed (won't spoil it by saying which ones) and the rest basically scheme and backstab each other. Think of the worst types of office politics only played with swords and various other medieval weapons. Bleah! You feel like you want to wash out your brains with soap after coming into contact with this mess! 4 toilet bowls/barf bags up!"
1	I have quickly gotten bored with this show. I was FAITHFUL in tuning in every single week and had my box of tissues right next to me. I have just never been able to stomach Merideth, watching her storyline alone became exhausting and repetitive. After the season with the hospital shooting, it just fell off after that. Then after Merideth and Derrick adopted a black baby, I had enough. I am tired of shows depicting what other celebrities are doing or trying to keep ratings by going with a trend. It ruined it for me that my beloved George and Izzy are gone, which I still think was the producers biggest mistake letting them go. Hopefully I will regain interest soon, I am hearing good things.
1	One of the best series ever with the worst final ever.
0	Wow they threw the kitchen sink at this series, and it does'nt work. I'm not sure what this program wants to be but its not convincing , looks like the makers have tried to include influences from too many era's and its all a bit unnecessary is it a neo noir it started out in black and white but no it reverts to colour ?. Maybe it'll get better . Its streets away from Miami Vice (The Movie) but Colin Farrell was convincing in that, here he's Not , whats with the wimpy soft spoken voice , If you wanta talk like that in a series like this you need a voice that's riddled with the effects of too many cigarettes in too many smoky Bars and too much whiskey a la Humphrey Bogart, Does'nt Work Colin !?Just proves that if you throw too much money at a series you don't always get a good one.
0	"Starts funny in season one with and old rookie cop that is trying his best to pass and be accepted. Funny situatons that gors with Fillions acting style. Then after two seasons it nd ends up being another ""us against the world"" show with conspiracies and police officers that over night become special forces and fights mafia and criminal organizations. ""The rookie"" concept is totally lost once he passes and becomes a police officer.Once you have finished season 2 don't torture yourself with season 3 and 4.Overall I give it two stars but the first two seasons I would have given six because it is true to the basic concept and is entertaining."
0	"This cast of emotionally stunted, confidence-deficient characters make you wonder how they ever put their socks on, paid a bill, cooked mac 'n' cheese, much less got through life, let alone med school, let alone conflicts, let alone surgeries. These caricatures of adults with their never-ending internecine dramas make kindergartner sandbox politics look like high-level international deal brokers by contrast. Meredith and that babysqueak voice who holds an endless torch for a dead-ender; Alex and his abject d-baggery, betrayals, and frat-boy antics; Cristina with an emotional iq of -- somehow is ""brilliant""/please?!; McDreamy who can rewire brains but can't figure out that he doesn't like his wife anymore; McNally who's got an elementary-grade crush--and what is with the unbelievable high body count? The death rate on the ORT makes it look like they got their med degrees at a vending machine. After a few episodes, we saw the pattern, ""Oh, s/he's not going to make it. That one's going to croak,"" and sure enough, we could predict with 95% certainty what would happen. It would be a comedy if the jokes were better and a drama if it weren't lathered in soapy ridiculousness. Total snoozer. This show's characters needed to have mature, internally strong personalities with high moral integrity and backbones working on patients--these show docs are often selfish, egotistical, dismissive, condescending and contemptible toward their patients--WHY would they go into medicine/surgery if they were misanthropes and preferred gazing at their bellybuttons (and below) more than saving lives and advancing medicine? It's a prima facie contradiction that sets up an untenable arc for compelling tv. Save yourself time."
0	It's suck season 8, So disappointed! It was good 1-7 season! But final episode so suck!
2	Like many other reviewers here, I am a diehard fan of the Fallout games. My introduction to the game series began 25 years ago when I picked up a copy of Fallout 2 and I've been hooked ever since. Never, in all that time, had I ever wished for a spinoff TV series to be made about it. Who asked for it? Not me! But nevertheless, here it is. It exists whether we like it or not and no matter how many negative reviews people submit based on pride, protest, or principle it will not change that fact. Look, no one is forcing anyone who strongly objects to this series to watch it (not yet anyway). But if its mere existence truly offends you, just don't watch it! What is there to gain by coming here to thumbs down positive reviews because you are so aggrieved? Anyone and everyone is free to ignore the show, just like I'm choosing to ignore the sense of entitlement these petty review-bombers have by giving this new series the glowing review it rightfully deserves based on the merits.With that business out of the way, my review here is for anyone with a sincere interest in this series in deciding whether they should give it a chance. And to that I say yes, absolutely you should whether you are a fan of the games or not. As I previously mentioned, I never asked for this show and was prepared to hate it. But I kept an open mind as I watched and did my best to be fair in my overall judgement. And the truth is, the show is actually pretty fantastic. I was not prepared for it to be as good as it is. This show definitely caters to fans of the franchise with its high attention to detail and faithfulness to source material. I sympathize with those who would have preferred that Hollywood not make the series in the first place, but at the same time, now having watched it, the hate towards it is pretty unjustified if the only crime is that it exists.To the angry Fallout fans I ask you this: Imagine a TV series is being made about this game that you and I both love. Imagine that it's completely out of your control, and production is actually happening. If a Fallout series HAS to exist, what exactly would you want it to look like? Would it not be similar to exactly what Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy have created? I mean, visually it's pretty spot on. They've built an immersive world that feels very authentic. It feels like Fallout, it looks like Fallout, and it sounds like Fallout. Okay, maybe you would have preferred the show was modeled after the Interplay games and not Bethesda's Fallout 4, or maybe you would have preferred the show runners double and triple check the accuracy of the lore because you find any cannon inconsistency unforgiveable.So let's address the elephant in the room: Yes, there are some glaring lore issues. But it doesn't bother me. Why? Because a TV series is a different medium for storytelling than a video game. For the sake of argument, let's assume this new series runs for 8 seasons with 8 one-hour episodes each. That's a total of 64 hours screen time. That's just a fraction of what most people put into playing a single game. I've put hundreds of hours into Fallout 4 alone. When playing a game, you have the luxury of time to explore it and study it as much as you like. That's the beauty of Fallout games. But television doesn't work that way. It's not interactive. The entertainment comes from literally just sitting in front of a screen and watching/listening to a story. Viewers are going to tune out fast if it becomes overly pedantic and boring. Sometimes it is necessary to truncate and/or modify original source material so that it translates better on screen and can hold the viewers' attention.For me personally, as a longtime fan, what mattered most was that the series captured the spirit, message, and immersive atmosphere of the games. No matter what, it needed to look and feel like Fallout, and Nolan and Joy nailed it. I don't know what more they could have done to make the series better than it is, and I'm honestly relieved that the creative liberties taken were not so egregious as to disrespect the entire franchise and its fanbase. On the contrary, they've done an excellent job here. They could have reimagined Fallout into some truly terrible fan fiction, but they didn't. It feels like a true extension of the Fallout universe and that's all I had hoped for. Jonathan Nolan made this series because he is also a fan and avid player of Fallout games. If anyone could pull it off, it was him.
1	Fallout is a very beloved series amongst Gamers with Its extensive world-building and Lore. The variety of factions and people that populate Its Wastelands to its themes of Corporatism and political ambition and its Morality & Ethics of Human Society. It's ripe for the picking stories to be told. All and all Fallout does well in not only respecting its source material but also serving as an entry point for newcomers without holding your hand. Putting you in the perspective of its main character starting with Lucy the vault dweller. Given her isolated upbringing and what she has been told her whole life. She's reckless, Naive, and Gullible. She has to adapt and learn from the people she comes across. And the choices she has to make and live with. The other two main characters. The Ghoul who is my favorite just this complete Badass bounty hunter and Cold-hearted man. You get to see his past pre-war and what's driving him. Maximus this brotherhood Squire who goes rogue in ways makes questionable choices in brotherhood. All three of their stories are tied to this Scientist. Also, this sub-plot Mystery Centered around Vault-tec. It feels Balanced out and paced the journey. You don't need to know everything about the Enclave, Brotherhood, or NCR. Prop also has to be given to the designers. I felt that they would have just done the bare minimum. The only well-made would've been the power armor. No, they did put effort into capturing the setting and atmosphere of the games. Morbid dark and violent. The Vaults Corps. Things like the Pip-Boy display and how it functions. The Action Lots of Blood and the use perfect use of Slo-mo Call back to V. A. T. S. The choice of Music how they had original Music, but also took from the Game Soundtrack and the way it's used adds to the charm. Overall, I enjoyed it, and for another season if it stays this route.
2	I love grey's anatomy. It is a wonderful show, and it's sweet, funny, and fun to watch. The characters I like the most are: Bailey, Chief, and Christina. The show is all about doctors, and operations, and of course, relationships. I think this show can go on and on and on for a long time. I think it will do well. I hope it makes more than 4 seasons, because I think that it's a really popular show. All the characters are good, and all the actors and actresses play their own character well, so I don't see it stopping at season 4. When I first watched season 1, I loved it. Then I watched season 2, I liked it, but didn't love it. I thought season 1 was too short, but I think it was better then season 2, in a way. Season 3 was good, but not excellent. I love grey's anatomy, and I'm so glad they're still showing it on air. I give the whole show a 10/10.
2	"I get it, it kinda sucks when they don't stick with the source material, but I think it's fine in this case. It's not a 100% accurate adaptation anyway, since they wanted to make it more ""international"", and that's okay -- you can change some characters and still retain the main story elements.They cut a lot from the story, but let's face it, the first halves of the first two books were not that great. There was plenty -- and I mean plenty -- to cut; the books had a jarring amount of exposition, irrelevant stories, and mathematical jargon. I mean, yeah, the math and science bits were interesting in themselves, but they don't exactly make a good story for a book.Sure, maybe they cut a bit too much at some points, like there happened a lot more in the Red Coast, they could have added a bit more of that. And I get that they cut off some the ETO stuff, which was quite boring at times, but not to mention the ETO even with one word? Yeah, maybe they went a bit far with that one. But other than that, I think the changes were good. Generally, they managed to cut the boring parts and expanded on the more interesting details and made the overall story much more cohesive. I think it was mainly for the better.It's a great show, acting, casting, and script is mostly good. Sure, it's not a masterpiece, but I liked it and it was entertaining and kept me on the hook. I literally binge-watched this in two days, so it is not really that bad at all. Give it a shot, it's only going to get better, as the story progresses and starts to show its more unique aspects. (I just hope they cut the boring bits about the second book, as well. Like, I seriously hope that one third of the season is not that random, irrelevant romance in the forest BS that had zero effect on the story.)"
0	What was the director thinking about, filming in one of the most colourful places on earth and filming in black and white, to me he was up his own bum. There are only 2 reasons to make a black and white movie,1/ colour film hadn't been invented.2/ you were making a war film and you wanted to cut in original war film into the movie.This would have been stunning to see filmed in colour, but the director had other ideas, the guy playing Ripley has all the charisma of a brick and a not very charismatic brick at that,I'm only at episode 1 and ready to give up, we live in a colourful world and we have misery served up in black nd white.
0	Absolutely no match to the 1980 TV series. That one was focusing on the drama, and did not try to look like an authentic depiction of year 1600 Japan. It had dramatic composition, good actors, and beautiful Japanese scenery, none of which this movie has.This movie has absolutely no dramatic composition, it feels like a documentary on Anjin's adventures in Japan, re-enacted, alas the story is almost all made up. It pretends to deliver an authentic year 1600 Japan, they employed all those experts to recreate the contemporary language and textiles, but they put all that in a landscape that is not Japanese at all, it looks like what it is, Canadian. The Japanese architecture is obviously computerI generated, and I guess that it is way too grandiose and lavish for war-torn Japan of the time. You hardly ever see a shot that is all real, no natural light, throughout the movie, it feels like we are in a computer game, and they keep using these wide-angle lenses with blurred and barrel-distorted background, I guess to make the CGI less obvious. The make-up is hardly authentic, rather it is made to look sexy to the modern viewer. Beauty ideals of the period were different; blackening the teeth for example was a common practice, especially for women, never to appear here. Surely the language sounds far more natural to the period than in the 1980 series, but if they paid so much attention to the Japanese language, how come all the Portuguese conversations are in English? The acting is dry, as you expect in a re-enacting, but Mariko is particularly disturbing, her Westernized facial gestures and walking clumsily in kimono is inauthentic even for a modern Japanese.
2	I actually came in expecting this show to be bad. Honestly, most the trailers I saw looked cringe and poorly put together. Thankfully, those trailers captured a few lesser moments but it didnt hurt the overally quality of the show.Yes, Lucy can be a bit annoying at times but after a few episodes her character continued to develop and she settled into the role. We also follow Maximus, the Ghoul and Norm. I was interested in each of the side stories that tied everything together.This is a great and rare example of how a show doesn't have to perfectly follow the games but can still be very good when you strike a good balance between characters, lore and storytelling while still tapping into the things that made it special in the first place. Something the recent Halo show failed miserably at.They also earn extra points by including dogs as an integral part of the story. After all, it was the thought of dogs being left out of the vaults that pushed Cooper(the ghoul) over the edge and into discovering what Val-tec was really about.This is a really fun, gory, dark but enjoyable ride. Looking forward to the next season for sure.
0	Lack of linguistic fidelity: -Dialogues in English when they should be in Portuguese, compromising immersion in the story and cultural authenticity.-Incorrect pronunciation of Portuguese, with a heavy English accent that sounds artificial and even caricatured.-Lack of attention to linguistic details, such as grammar and vocabulary errors.Inappropriate stereotypes and representations: -Portuguese characters portrayed in a negative light, as being ignorant, superstitious or violent.-Exaggerations and distortions of Portuguese culture, reinforcing pre-existing stereotypes.-Lack of research and historical accuracy in the representation of the time and events portrayed.Devaluation of the Portuguese language and Portuguese culture: -The choice to make the series in English rather than Portuguese can be seen as devaluing the Portuguese language and culture.-The lack of care taken with the Portuguese language in the series can be seen as a lack of respect for speakers of the language and for Portuguese culture.-The series can contribute to the perpetuation of negative stereotypes about Portugal and the Portuguese.Conclusion: -The Shogun series, despite having great production value, displays a disrespect for the Portuguese language and for Portugal. It is important to criticize the series for these problems and to demand greater quality and rigor in productions that portray Portuguese culture.
1	I looked forward to this for over a years. Game of Thrones show runners,! What can go wrong.The first two episodes aren't too bad. Sticking to the same general idea from the book. Boy did it hit the fan then. It felt like a cheap sci-fi studio trying to find its way. I wonder if D&D even bothered to read book. Ivan only imagine elbow there going to butcher the other two books. FormGod's sake they even changed the aliens names. Why?If you want to be bored and watch the ridiculous then this show is for you. Yeah. The effects aren't bad but the story that is so intricate to the series has been ripped apart. Oh well, that's my two sense.
0	Show writers and Director of the show don't care about fans any more. They just want to end GOT as soon as possible.
2	When this limited series popped up on Netflix, I only intended to watch the first couple of episodes, but I ended up binge-watching the entire series in one go.The story follows struggling comedian Donny (played by the show's writer and director, Richard Gadd), who encounters a crazy woman named Martha. What starts as an awkward encounter escalates into a horrifying situation. Gunning delivers a chilling performance as Martha, while Gadd portrays Donny's descent into fear with raw vulnerability.I like going into a show blind, yet I find it's only the best ones that can hook me in quickly when I don't know anything about it; otherwise, I like to have some knowledge of what it's about.Reindeer can be described as a black comedy, but it also has much tension, making it equally a dark psychological drama. The opening credits start with a notice that it's based on actual events. I have no idea how much of it has been embellished for artistic license. Honestly, you couldn't make this up, and while it's a strange story that unfolds, nothing in it is unbelievable.While the show does provide some funny moments, it's a lot more than a comedy. It has as much tension, if not more, than an A-list Hollywood blockbuster thriller. There are moments when I cringe as if I were in the room with them, feeling the awkward tension, and other moments where I feel myself shouting at the screen, warning Donny to get out quickly before his stalker, Martha, sees him.Baby Reindeer isn't afraid to tackle tough topics like drugs, mental health, and sexual abuse. The show's unflinching portrayal might not be for everyone, hence the 18+ rating.I've always thought being a stand-up comedian is a tough job. Richard Gadd gives a fantastic performance of his own bad comedy routine that doesn't hit the mark, and I found myself rooting for him to tell a better joke and for the audience to laugh. I gained a whole new level of respect for comedians.If you enjoy thought-provoking dark dramas with solid performances and a touch of humour, I highly recommend Baby Reindeer.
0	Starting with the casting, which is atrocious (only Dakota Fanning is good for that role). Tom and Dickie, they're too old for the roles, they don't look like each other at all, no chemistry, no friendship between them, just dullness. And don't get me started with Freddie Miles, my god. Andre Scott is a good actor, but whomever though this was a good fit for the role, should be fired.There's more substance, style and development in 2 hours of Anthony Minghella's movie than in 8 whole hours of this.People calling this a masterpiece should watch the movie instead, it's better in every aspect.
0	First) Lucy McClean do very close to Lucy MacClane. This character is the worst parody of Brenden Fraser character in Blast to the Past. She's mentally lost but supposed to be the best fighter from Vault 23.Second) the ghoul gun fighter reminds of the Spaghetti western My Name is Nobody and acts worst than thst character.The subplot, if there's one, has nothing to with Fallout.The area has something to do with Fallout and thats all.The 8s,9s and 10s from reviewers and critics are heinous and no one actually played all the games.Fake creation of Fallout history.The dog is the only good actor.The writing for the whole story/episodes is childish and robotic.The musical score is the worst especially in Episode 1 fight scene.
0	I am noticing the degrading quality of current way of story telling and making films in this industry, which employs a disgusting technique to conduct systematic attacks on a normal person's psyche.One of the most subtle technique is to relax the audience first by showing a calm and safe scene or environment...then out of nowehere attack their sense with extremely discomforting scenarios, like animal abuse or extreme violence, mistrust, dropping a atomic bomb on a nice summer day family gathering, other kind 'wanting to shock and attack the open mind' tactics....... And any type of relationship is reduced to animalistic sex, nothing more, empty, meaningless, there sole purpose is shock value, not creating complex but deeper bonds, just sex = love, but it will turn into hate the next moment because people engaged never knew one another to begin with.....Relax the audience and shock them. Especially with unneccesaary Violence, mistrust and lack of true connection.This show is no exception for employing such disgusting tactics to assault human sensibility and psyche. Our minds when open... begin to trust and take in and ready to really open up to receive more information, thats why they create scenes that build such trust of audience and then bombard them with abusive elements.If people are unaware of this, they just absorb this as normal and even appreciate it, while subconsciously they will be programmed to on a celluar level, because body remembers, to never truly trust and relax into the beneficial nature of reality and human nature.They just want the audience live in subtle mistrust and anxiety and most relationships they show on tv nowadays do not have redeeming, long lasting, deeper bond qualities, it is often disconnected, empty, build mistrust and shock value oriented.I noticed plenty of all that in this series.Nothing deep. Incredibly shallow and empty, and unneccesarily violent.It does not make the world any one bit better.I could not even finish first episode as i recognized what is so rampant in current trend of film making in this one..I pass this, as it's energy is really yucky.
1	"In all honesty Greys Anatomy is a decent show and just one I watched from the culture popularity of it. ""Mcdreamy"" Meredith, etc. It starts weak and cheesy with voice over but it grew on me and became acceptable as I justified it's tv and apparently it's their style. With elevator clips in a non moving elevator. I could go on about everything in greys anatomy that I don't like, how characters don't show growth until season 3. I thinks it over rated, had a strong start but as it progresses no one learns from their mistakes and keep the same pattern, it makes me passionately hate everyone in the show. But I will not lie, up through season 5 into 6 it kept me going in hopes that my questions were answered, but often ignored. Spoilers Another thing that bothered me was the inconsistency throughout the show. That MEREDITH DIDNT ANSWER A SINGLE QUESTION ON THE INTERN EXAM AND STILL BECAME A RESIDENT?! HOW?!"
1	It's a slow burn science fiction show with major plot issues.The aliens become afraid of humans and decide to exterminate us when they learn that we are capable of not telling the truth on purpose, lying. Yet several months before they leaned that humans can lie the aliens sent an advanced AI computer to Earth that would completely change actual results of all of our scientific experiments and provide us with false information, A LIE. Their advanced computer is lying to us so that our technology never advanced to a level that can one day destroy these invaders. They are capable of lying and should destroy themselves.The scene where the wire that can cut through anything was used to kill was intense. I don't understand why the scientist that created it had to watch everything on the monitors and then was allowed to sift through the body parts. She was really annoying.
1	They keep the style of the games, music but unfortunately they keep Bethesda tradition of poor and uninspiring dialogues.TV series is clearly made for game fans. .There's no much intro into world building, what is the background of each fraction.Some moments looks unrealistic and unlogical even for Fallout retro-futuristic world building. As the other user pointed out, how protection system were so ignorant to the radiationI have played almost every game from this franchise and even they were not so idiotic in some moments. Also I was really happy to see that they gave a role to Ron Perlman, who is a voiceover veteran in this franchise.
2	I have spend around 15 years and try to read the original book, but unfortunately I really can't take the writer's story maybe it is how the original writer's way to tell the story, but thanks Netflix this is my first time really entertaining the story; mostly people just wish to use their own mindset to make judgments it is really hilarious that they are the same as this show first 10 mins those people at the civil revolution's. PS: I also try to watch the Tencent version, the Tencent version more like a trash which used for money laundering purpose. Thanks to Netflix to bring this show, it is really worth this monthly subscription,
0	"As Agatha would've asked - Why didn't they asked Evans...or anybody who had read Patricia's Ripley books, if they were to busy or lazy to read them themselves?To fully understand Ripley, one should really read at least the first three books, not just read the short digest version of what's happening in the first one.And then, one should watch Wim Wenders' American Friend based on the second book - Ripley Under Ground(Der amerikanische Freund, 1977. ) for both Wenders' directorial approach and scripting, for Robby Müller's rich cinematography and, of course, for exuberant Dennis Hopper's Ripley.Ripley (books) is not Noir, it is not a ""Krimi"" it is a study in ""normal"" human behavior, there are no real villains or heroes, just a regular human beings, not intrinsically bad or evil, being the same as everyone most of the time, but ""bending the envelope"" in extreme circumstances. Tom may be ""less moral"" than an average person in some respects, but he's also deeply moral in his own way. More moral in hard circumstances than majority of people would be.And Wenders' film also shows that you don't have to go B&W to ""have atmosphere"", his richly colored Ripley movie is brimming with it. Unlike this poorly made gimmick version of magnificent Patricia's masterpiece."
1	First I'm glad the major networks are investing in SciFi which has been a backwater for the last couple decades. I also think this is the best SciFi television show since Westwood S1/Expanse S1,S2.I loved the premise, especially the first few episodes. Unfortunately the show gets gummed up in the later half by spending too much time on the characters, odd priorities for the characters, and not spending enough time on backstory.For example, why can't the San-Ti use their protons to start wiping out people they don't like instead of using half-baked assassins? They can control every television screen on the planet and impact machinery (I think), so why not start crashing planes of anyone they want dead. Why not start killing more scientists? There might be answers to these but the show does a super poor job of explaining the backstory.I also had a hard time following character incentives and decisions, they were so moody and mopey for the fate of humankind to be on the line.The show is at its best either when having action go down or getting into human nature. I loved the judgement day ship episode precisely because it was so uncomfortable and welded SciFi with painful morality decisions.Finally, I wish D&D had written every episode instead of just half the show. If there is a season 2 they really need to keep their foot on the gas and not outsource any of the writing, this season felt disjointed at times and lacked a lot of backstory and hand-holding for SciFi.Overall enjoyed it and hope more is coming.
0	Arthurian legend telenovela so bad that it's awkward to watch.
0	This started off as a magnificent show. Season 8 has ruined it. I've never seen anything so tragically bad in my life. Poor scripting, unconvincing plot, shocking acting and Gendry doesn't make it to the throne. I will not recommend. I have PTSD from this show.HBO - remake it now.There are no spoilers in this review because there is nothing to spoil.
0	"This show is a disgrace in the sense they could't even go through the troube of getting a portuguese speaking actor and constantly disregarded the language and its importance.I watched the first episode with high expectations given the rating only to be lef extremely disapointed by the end of it, frankly losing the will to watch any more of this garbage.I spoke about the portugese laguage's complete disregard but that was not my only issue of course, one could mention the historical inaccuracies, the uncalled for nudity (only to appear more mature), and the extremely corny and tropy opening.Once again about the disrespect towards the portuguese, not once during the first episode did I hear about a portuguese sailor, always talk about a spanish sailor in the portugese ships almost as if the portugese were so truly incompetent they could't even sail their own ships.Since you are willing to have a majorly japanese show marketed to a non japanese speaking audience the inclusion of portuguse speaking characters would not be against the ""no subtitles watchers"" since the whole show requires the damn subtitles!"
1	No thanks to D&D who ruined what could have been the greatest TV show of all time! HBO should never hire these two idiots ever again! Unless HBO remakes the last 2 seasons or at least the season finale, they would lose alot of subscribers. Forget about making a GOT prequel if it's made by those two idiots again! We won't watch them!
2	I have to say, I think Grey's Anatomy was and is probably my favorite television show. It started as just a show to be interested in, but it evolved, characters grew, a large part of the show focused on right or wrong, which is something I focus on a lot in life. But now watching the last few episodes, I can guarantee I will cry during each one. I'm seeing the characters I watched grow from residents to Harper-Avery Award recipients, get married, have kids, lose friends and family, face almost every adversity someone like myself pictures themselves going through- and I'm not even on the same career path. I've seen how hard one has to work to achieve what they want, and the sacrifices they made along the way. The Office was my favorite, but it lacked the perfect ending and the complete character development this show provided. I got very attached, and will miss this show with all my heart!
0	I completely understand how this was greenlit. On paper it sounds great, but in practice it's as if chat-gpt wrote a detective story using the Save the Cat template, incorporating all the 'elements' of old school noir but none of the charm or skill in execution. They try REALLY hard to make the lead likeable, having him 'save' many a stray, but it comes off so awkward and forced. Instead of clues, you get drugged out montages, flashbacks and fake outs. Instead of classic noir dialogue exchanges, you get these weird accusatory standoffs.This looks like it cost a lot of money, it's a shame they didn't spend any of it on the actual writing of a story.The cast does look great, so there's that at least...I guess.
2	"The book? Never read it. So I can neither recommend nor pan this as an adaptation. I take it as it gives itself which in impressive ways is spectacular. Visuals, especially in-game are something to behold. The story, long though it develop, is filled with twists you probably couldn't anticipate but they aren't introduced simply to snap your head. The story, as it develops presents vexing problems that are solved (or solved for now) unconventionally by individuals with unlikely but preparatory interests or expertise, so, however out there, bizarre solutions seem obviously the right thing to do. Even though, it turns out, nothing can be undertaken that isn't already anticipated. The enemy (I'll here not give them away) immediately knows every decision made by anybody so no action taken can be a surprise. But it turns out humans aren't entirely without recourse in the face of seemingly all-knowing ""whatever they are"" things. If I find fault, it's the casting on the whole. Rather drab but there are standouts. Benedict Wong as a rumpled agent of a security agency is very good. And I just have an affection for Liam Cunningham who here plays the "" He's very bad. He's very good"" boss of earth's opposition and so every character's challenge to think beyond themselves or fail or quit or act exasperated. All in all, these initial eight episodes entertain emotionally and exercise the old brain too."
1	I'm rewatching the whole show at the moment.I really love the first few seasons 1-4, and like the seasons 5-7/8.After that just too many of the main characters left/died. There are not many left to like. I'm still not over Derek's Death and liked Lexie's Character very much as well. And I always was a fan of Meredith. She was this flawed character I could empathise with.Some charachters have a lot of depth and the show doesn't mind tackling heavy subjects. The acting and drama in this show is outstanding. Some episodes will blow your mind. Sandra Oh's acting was always fantastic, Christina was by far the best character. I wished they had stopped after she left.In the latest season it's all about political correctes though, which I usually don't mind, but it's just too much. I always thought the show handled subjects like racism, sexism, diversity etc. Very well.Give it a try. It's good entertainment (but don't get stuck on the realism of the portrayal of medicine)
1	I literally have to fast forward through EVERY scene including Maggie.
2	"Game of Thrones broke the magical drama ""Magic"" with its high attitude of ""creating miracles"", subverting the creative level of all Hollywood magic movies in one fell swoop, becoming an insurmountable peak in the magic film and television industry. It gives actors, directors, and screenwriters unlimited creative possibilities. With its unlimited and orderly creative space, it includes thousands of full-featured characters, weird and unique imaginative local customs, and its complete space, rich details, The narrative's delusion is sighing."
0	"As a big fan of ""The Three-Body Problem"" books, I was really looking forward to Netflix's adaptation. The books stand out because they don't have clear-cut heroes or villains - it's all about people navigating complex situations.However, the Netflix series seems to have missed that subtlety. It quickly sets up a clear divide between good and evil, losing the nuanced character motivations that are central to the books. It's a bit disappointing to see the story's moral complexities smoothed over like this.Also, setting the series in London feels like a missed opportunity. The book's global perspective is one of its strengths, emphasizing a united human response to an extraterrestrial threat. By narrowing the focus to one city, particularly a Western one, the show loses some of the original's universal appeal.In short, while the Netflix series might be entertaining on its own, it doesn't fully capture the spirit of the books. It's a more straightforward interpretation, which might not satisfy those who appreciated the original's depth and global scale."
0	I've read many of the 10/10, 9/10 reviews, and I beg to differ. While the visuals are strong, the changes made to the book's story are not an improvement on the book. This version makes it hard for me to follow the story, and this telling sheds little light on the vast cultural differences between Japan & Europe that the book and 1980 version capture so well.The actor playing Blackthorne seems like a caricature. It's hard to imagine someone like him actually being accepted into the Japanese fold. The actor playing the Portuguese pilot doesn't work, as well as the actor who played the 1st priest Blackthorne encounters. I was hoping for a much more insightful take on the story, 40 some years after the 1st production, with the technology and cultural discernment available these days.
0	Not often a series turns my stomach but this did. So many episodes and none of the characters come out looking normal, likeable or relatable. Usually we root for the main character but I just wanted to shake him at every turn.He was a grown man with free will and of a sane mind but he said was groomed. He had prior experience of the guy's perversion and continued to see him in the process disrespecting his girlfriend and her mother and risking his home. Why report only the female offender to the police? The guy he met did worse, but he kept quiet for what? Money, fame or opportunities? Felt misogyny was at play with many of his actions, using and only holding women to account for their actions, allowing all the men in his life a free pass to continue to rape, keep a pub licence after lock-ins drug use, violence etc.The stalker was by far the best actress in it.Won't be interested in anything this 'comedian' has to offer in future.
0	I have really liked the show, but with Meredith's new love interests are not all good. I'm not a fan of the character deluca, link is alright.
0	This is quite simply the worst Sci-Fi adaptation or standalone TV show created in the last ten years. How it has got so many reviews can only be attributed to shill reviewers who have never seen it or have been paid to give a positive rating.It began with a thin plot around alien tech but slowly degenerated to nothing more than a clumsy cliff note analysis of humanity and its effect on mother earthWe are patronised with the sermon humanity doesn't deserve to live even if the aliens come in peace. We are beyond hope, and if the lead actors were the best we had to offer in defence of an invasion, I would wholeheartedly agree.
0	"Unbelievable how this silliness could get such a high rating. The first few seasons are Okish, but then it becomes absolutely stupid. Yes, Castle also was naive and unrealistic, but the amount of stupidity and cliche in Rookie in each and every scene, each phrase, each plot twist is overwhelming. If you enjoy idiocy in plot, bad acting, bad dialogues, boring stories, you will like it. But anyone who has a small bit of taste would find Rookie unbearable to watch. It's a tragedy that such kind of low quality show is kept extended while some truly great shows are closed due to ... ""low auditory interest""?"
2	"A lot of reviews here draw a parallel with Talented Mr. Ripley and a lot others clearly deny us to do so but this review is none. Basically, I have not watched the older version.So the story is about deception and the shooting places are awe striking. The scenery and art itself are enough to leave us spellbound and the former is cherished by a black&white filming. The series presents a poor but determinant Ripley who goes to Italy by the aim of bringing his employer's son and it is here that story starts.The series is beautiful and there are very few things you can complain about. (For now I have none). Additionally, the goods are in abundance. Whether it be a magnificently aligned story with Caravaggio or provoking confusions such as killing Marge(Not a spoiler, you will know what I mean when you watch it) or the dialogues. One of more interesting things about the series is that it retrieves the informations which it gave in past episodes like the dialogue ""The light, Always the light""."
0	As a huge fan of the books this is a travesty. I will start with the basics, where did they find some of these actors!?. I keep waiting for john to head down the pub or some other stereotype. Soap opera level at best. One of the key ingredients in the story is the development of sophons to prevent human tech growth. They don't even show or mention it so the viewer has no idea why things are as they are. It jumps about at a chaotic pace almost like my review. One of the best characters early on is da chi and thats butchered. The cgi bloody hell 1995 Jurassic park is better. Awful stuff, how these two directors still have work ill never know.
0	We loved the first 2 seasons. But started watching season 3 and were disappointed by yet another show ruined by pushing agendas with that being the main focus of every story line. I don't know why I expected anything different from anything that comes out of Hollywood.
2	"Stick with it, starts off a little slow for the first few episodes but then really takes off with a lot of science to counter balance the ""fiction"". It's good and entertaining. Anyone giving this a low score didn't give it a chance and wanted to just be the first to give a review cause they think they are Siskal or Ebert. Just give it a shot. It's solid and will at times early not make much sense but those questions (most) get answered in time. Yes, some of it is hokey and you have to suspend imagination but if you're into sci-fi, this is 100% your jam and I can't wait to see where this goes...."
0	But really, The Rookie has graduated and has become the go to guy? Not working; terrific characters that have meshed nicely during the 1st 2 seasons are becoming secondary to the Mighty but faltering Fillion. And Bailey, Ms. I can do it all, except act her way out of a paper bag. Awful, annoying character. And seriously, what have they done to Chen's character anyway? She deserves better. And STOP with that way-too-loud cringe-worthy music that you insist on playing along with ACTUAL DIALOGUE. It's unnecessary and distracting.
1	I had only watched the Matt Damon film for the first time a couple months ago and loved it for it's interesting characters and tension building. I'm a fan of Andrew Scott from his role as Moriarty in Sherlock and thought that Tom Ripley seemed right up his alley. I was looking forward to seeing what a mini series could do with the story given it would have so much extra time.Therein lies my first issue with the series, for all the extra time it has it I don't really feel that there was all that much more substance to the story. The main points of the film are repeated (at least in the first two thirds) and any of the additional points the series has over the film don't amount to much (With the exception of the expansion of the detectives role who's performance I enjoyed). It simply moves at a very slow pace with a lot of artsy shots and long takes which are nice but again don't add much.I also didn't really feel that any of the main members of the cast were distinctly better than their counterparts in the film. That's not to say they were bad but I definitely prefer the portrayal of the characters in the film.Part of this I believe is also down to what I felt was sometimes quite awkward dialogue. I didn't buy the Tom / Dickie friendship at all and some scenes seemed entirely out of character or people would do stupid things that make little sense.Ultimately I'd be interested to know how someone who hasn't seen anything Ripley before perceives the show. For me it was fine but I'd certainly recommend people watch the film over this show. I did appreciate the final scene of the show which I think was a brilliant moment in an otherwise often dull or dragging viewing experience.
0	"Episode 19, season 4. You are throwing The Rookie out the window so you can highlight ""The Rookie - FbI' - a thoroughly Disgusting, ROTTEN series. The network obviously is not reading the public's' opinions of this new offshoot.You have TOTALLY ""jumped the Shark"" in Epi 19. Season 4. Nolan's girlfriend leads the charge into the electrical Substation aiming an assault squad Machine gun - She is a FIREFIGHTER for God's sake. What in hell is WRONG with you people ?????????? ...It absolutely Stinks ! I watched (tried that is) watching the new FBI Rookie. It was totally abysmally bad, as was the rotten ""actress"" that supposedly leads the offshoot.And I see it was picked up for a 2cnd season. Who, exactly is this ugly, no talent person sleeping with ? I would like to be a bit more unpleasant in my language but I am short it won't be allowed. She is absolutely Terrible.SEASON 5- EPI 4. - Are you kidding me ? You have TOTALLY Jumped the shark - sometimes I really enjoy watching this show ,but - get Rid of the SERIAL Kealler redhead !!!!!!!!!You have completely jumped the shark with this .... You have RUINED it for everyone."
0	Had to go from 3 to 1 stars bc after I finished the very long Chinese POV, these two should never again mention GoT, EVER EVER EVER. I knew the two DBs would blow it and I didn't even read the book and only cuatro episodes in. The two female leads, I mean where are they getting all these noBodies; it felt amateurish. I can care less if characters in the book are flat, movies need to take you for a ride but once I heard that female 'Lord' character, I knew more bull crap was coming. As soon as the homosexuality was presented, I just sighed and moved on. Red China should have been gloomier and not just a 10 minute business. I cannot even believe this was a crowned sci-fi novel to begin with. I'm going to skip to the eight episode and see if it's worth watching. An advice to the wonder boys --Gone are days of GoT! Welcome to mediocrity....you should have gotten better actors, the ones that know how to play the scene...people whose art it has been for centuries...the story itself is just how can I say it without being offensive...it's like outsiders looking inside, that wrote it, but really not getting the source of why it is the insiders are they way they are. I'm still shocked at how mediocre it is bc even the wonder boys used their names to tout it and it in advertisements and I was excited but once I new few more details I knew it would just NOT BE. But the real problem is the end of the world theme...I don't know how this book plays out but movies will never succeed in this area bc man simply doesn't get God. At times I felt like it was referencing how God acts with human...knows every detail about us, like their Sophons(so), very God like attributes but they are the enemy. I feel like man is trying to say something...they hate God! They drop Christ's name in vain and so this goes down as another underwhelming end of the world story! Yes the end is here...thank God!!!
1	"This show is very good and dont get me wrong with the title. I did personally enjoy the show a lot however what kept me from giving the show a higher score was the amount of story decisions they made too fit the games.The way I see it there are positve and negative aspects to creating a complete original story based on the propertiy of Fallout and I will explain my reasoning.(Also for refrence I am a big Fallout fan and have played all Fallout game entries)The positives of making an original story is that it is a lot more engaging too watch. If they had just adapted Fallout 1 I wouldnt have been shocked at all over the ending or been as engaged in the show tho of course that is really hard to say so take that opinion with a grain of salt. The point is you have the ability to tell a completely new and original story set in the universe which is a good thing.All the references are really neat and its fun too hear the stimpack sound effect or hear the quest clear marker when you reach a location. But some things were a bit cringe like the use of the famous line ""War never changes"", which just felt really shoehorned in near the end.The horror aspect is also something I am very confused by as none of the mainline entry games focus on the horror aspect. However as a tv show I get that adapting the source material and interpreting it in such a way isnt necessarily a bad thing just very unique.The bad parts come when discussing the story of the show. There is a lot of focus on cold fusion and the politics of vault-tec which is something that again, none of the mainline fallout games focus on and the whole concept of cold fusion is never mentioned in any of the Fallout games. Fallout 3 might have the biggest influence on the show since the whole concept of Lucy going out to save her dad is taken from the game. Which I dont like because Fallout 3 easily has the worst story ever.The NCR are poorly written and their backstory is quite interesting dating back to fallout 1 and 2 which gets thrown out the window here. New Vegas gets no love as well only showing the strip in the absolute end of the last episode which just seems like they are hyping it up for season 2 so we'll see where that takes us. Apart from that no ceasars legion, no supermutants (in fact the show never even mentions them) but the biggest offense might be the enclave. The enclave are the main villains of Fallouts 2 and 3 and they are featured a little in Fallout 1 as well but here they have practically no impact on the story. Just that the scientist guy escaped from the enclave which might be an allusion to a scientist from Fallout 2 actually, but thats beside the point. They are basically not important too the story whatsoever in fact the brotherhood of steel are the only faction that are featured prominently in the show. Which is a bit of a weird decision since there are many factions that could have made it in. New reno gangs, Vault city, all the factions from san franciso arent mentioned like the hubologists and no fallout 4 factions like railroad or the synths. Brotherhood and enclave are pretty much in all Fallout games so I guess it made sense to mention those but cmon. There is also no GECK but storywise I can understand why you wouldnt want to mention it (Its basically the equivilent of cold fusion in the show).Overall some creative decisions werent my favourite tho I enjoyed the show a lot and wheter it was a ""faithful adaptation"" is up to interpretation. On one hand it was simply adapting the universe which it did fairly well, but on the other the factions, the characters the locations are changed to fit the new creative narrative of the show which is a bit of a shame in my opinion. I think the show would have benifited from adapting more of Fallout 1 and 2, rather than 3 and 4 if that makes sense.I cant wait for season 2 tho and I will definitely come back for more!"
2	Season 1-6 were easily 10s, best series I've ever watched. Season 7 was way to sped up and they lost the magic that was game if thrones, I'd give it a 7. Season 8 is down right terrible, I'd give it a 4 or t. SPOILERS. For how great this series was this was the worst ending imaginable. Bad dialogue, no explanations, far fewer conspiracies in a back room, and every main character is invincible vs the other soldiers who die immediately. Great war was everything but. The last war was garbage. Can't wait for Martin to finish the series so I can see how it really ends cause this isn't it.
2	I am without a doubt one of this shows biggest fans. These people are like family to me and once I finished watching season 13, I go back to the beginning and start over. From season 13 and onwards has become more and more painful. Season 17 is absolutely awful. This is supposed to be entertaining and enjoyable, taking ppls minds of the real world. Covid draging on and on and on. Really? And Alex leaving!! I am sorry but that is it for me. The show is over.
1	I understand this is set on a video computer game from the late 90's. I watched the first episode and thought what a load of complete rubbish. But fate intervened. The next day it bucketed of rain so I thought let's endure the next 7 episodes. As it turns out it's a good yarn. Not as bloody as I was led to believe but those bits were obviously from the shoot me up game. The interesting bit for me was to see what transgresses with the vaults. How they came about . In that I think it could have been completed in two episodes. There was a bit of fallow humour. The parallels with the modern MIC was very good. A few messages that may have gone completely over the head of a less mature audience. (As in age). I liked the retro 50's look at times and I'm assuming it's an alternative universe but maybe I'm looking too deep. The ending was too obvious for me and in fact I guessed the premise from episode 1 when the father, Kyle MacLachlan gets kidnapped. However it was better than I suspected. It seems the fanboys of the game are divided on the film series. If like me you've never played the game or ever intend playing the game it'll be worth a watch.
2	I read the book and yes, it's amazing! But I have zero qualms about the tv show trimming down some of the fat and adjusting things for the screen version. Expecting anything else is just childish.We live in an age where majority of tv shows barely make it to season 2, so of course the writers are moving things along at an accelerated pace. They do not have the luxury of unlimited page numbers, especially considering the season 1 is only eight episodes long.With that said, I found the show to be extremely well produced, with top notch visuals and excellent and engaging storytelling. The cast is for the most part a good fit for their characters, with Asian actors especially standing out in their performances, which will definitively appeal to the audiences in the east.What I really liked is the world building. We get an incredibly vivid sense of the world and jumping between Asia, Europe and USA, definitively helps appreciate the scale and gravity of the events unfolding. At moments it feels as if we're watching a global blockbuster movie.A lot of the philosophycal and existential questions are posed and if you enjoy your brain getting tickled by large topics, this will be very enjoyable.
1	My girlfriend and her friends love this show, making sure to queue up every episode on the TiVo as to not miss a minute of it. So I thought I'd check it out; see what all the commotion was about. Lucky for me, ABC is streaming the latest season on their site.I started with the season premiere. 15 minutes in and I'm already having a hard time paying attention, let alone taking it seriously. Then I'm thinking maybe it's not supposed to be serious, but soon I realize the comedy is so weak and cliché I quickly switch shows. Luckily, ABC's got a great lineup: Ugly Betty (hilarious, fresh, knows its audience), The Nine (dramatic, suspenseful, sincere), and Six Degrees (at least tries to be entertaining while maintaining respect for its audience).After exhausting all my options and completely catching up on the entire ABC lineup, I grudgingly return to Grey's anatomy, honestly hoping to be surprised by the time I finish the third episode.Here's the thing: I find most of the cast completely shallow and Uninteresting.I find it incredibly annoying that the bulk of the show is comprised of Dr. Grey's romance between two guys who aren't even an ounce as Charming, brilliant, and through-provoking as any of the male cast of ER. OK, the show is named after her, but I can't help but think she's trying to do what ally McBeal already did extremely well. (And Sex & The City while I'm at it.) That act is very hard to follow.The rest of the cast are clowns; bimbos and dopes who belong on a Daytime sitcom. It's like saved by the bell meets days of our lives. Are we really expected to believe any medicine is being practiced here? At least with scrubs we knew they were off the wall and completely unserious (until it mattered). With Grey's anatomy, we have a loosely Ad-libbed (romantic?) Comedy filled with sporadic moments of drama that Are so forced they're unbelievable to the point of insincere.I like Chandra Wilson and Katherine Heigl. They're great. They're a Good fit. Sara Ramirez is great to watch, but her character is just ridiculous. Sandra Oh is embarrassing. Patrick Dempsey could be better utilized. T.R. Night definitely needs to go.You're better off watching the rest of the ABC lineup. Better yet, watch ER reruns and see what a real show is like.
2	Its one thing to watch a show knowing that its tough but when it's based on real events its messed up on so many levels.Nonetheless, I totally recommend it, as its -in my opinion- the most accurate way of describing a healing process of abuse. Well, not fully.The show itself is incredibly written and acted, its so distressing to the point I couldn't believe that the main actor Richard Gadd is the one who all these things happened to so reliving your trauma and make a whole show about it is so strong!Well you be uncomfortable watching it? Yes. Well it overwhelm you? Yes! But its a must watch to actually understand some mental health issues or people who've been abused or stalked!
0	All the seasons build up for what?! What was all the prophecies for? Nothing. They lied to you. Sign the petition. Terrible last season.
1	This show is Hollywood nonsense. The storyline is difficult to follow thanks to an over-abundance of poorly crafted noirish melodrama combined with camera work reminiscent of a stoner who has watched too many Tarantino films but didn't pay attention in film school to pull of more than a late-night infomercial. It kind of reminds me of an attempt to copy Fesr and Loathing without the drug references that let the viewer know why they're seeing camera blurs, light flashes and whatnot. I mean, is the lead character high?At one point, a body is found. Apparently, it had been stuffed in this spot where people come and go day and night. Bodies stink incredibly. Yet nobody had noticed.Suffice to say that I won't be watching. In fact, it's time to cancel AppleTV. They're just not producing quality programs.
1	The writing is terrible, the show is rushed. They made Arya Stark the main character of this season and she is on of the worst characters on the show. They need to restart this season.
2	Completely unique true storyline of an obsessive stalker! Saath samundar paar mein tere piche piche aa gayi - The feeling that triggers post completing it. It's dark, witty n very gripping. Within 5 minutes of the first episode, one gets hooked on to it completely. The fear of getting stalked is indeed one horrible thing anybody can experience. The lady who played character of stalker Marta was brilliant. 7 episodes of 30 minutes each. Very well written n executed though ending is a little disappointing but can't help that being a true story. Available in Netflix including in Hindi. My ratings 8/10!
2	I am in awe of how creative Richard Gadd is. He truly impressed me, and after having read/watched about his other projects I have immense respect for his art. I'm also impressed by how brave and vunerable he is to share so much of his life. Jessica Gunning was incredible in this! She made me feel so many emotions, outstanding acting. I like how creative this show is, it feels like a play at times, which is no surprise considering Gadd's background, but that's what elevates it to art. It is truly hard to watch at times especially when Donny makes the worst decisions possible, but it truly shows how hard trauma and self-loathing is to overcome. It's brilliantly written, and Gadd's performance is incredible as well.
1	"First, the show says ""9 months later"". Sorry, LAPD takes at least a year to be accepted. Then the academy is at least 16 weeks. Body cams are not run the whole shift. First, the batteries wouldn't last that long. They are used on calls and traffic stops or when the officer thinks it's needed. Facial hair, unless it's a mustache, is not allowed. When Nolan shot the perp in the left, he would have spent the rest of the shift in IA for a shooting review. No 3 day growth and especially not chin hair like on the black supervisor. Lastly, the black rookie would have been fired for freezing the way he did. Period. I could go on but you get the idea. Clean up a few things, stop making the women female John Wayne's and the men wimps, it might get renewed."
0	Like with Good Doctor,Grey's Anatomy. Writing and story Arc got awful.Nolan and Chen dating she was told it was bad for her career. So they broke up.Then they want to put her with Bradford another disaster's career move. Then they waste screen time to figure out on how it would be ok and not a conflict with their duties at work to put them together. And Nolan choosing to be a Training Officer right after being a rookie. WTF. I would rather have someone seasoned who give more advice on different situations. How is show still called the Rookie he is not a Rookie anymore.Still the story of the white savior..
0	Nope. Why would a wealthy man want to pay a smarmy 40-year old stranger a lot of money to go get his 40-year old son? Can someone please explain to me how exactly Johnny Flynn AND Andrew Scott both managed to be completely charmless? I feel like that would take monumental effort from both of them. This felt like I was watching a suicidally depressed Wes Anderson directing a bored cast high on quaaludes in an art-house film. Was it very pretty? Sure. Did I absolutely loathe my once-favourite character from the Ripley saga (Freddie Miles)? Yup. Why did they cast a woman to play a man's role? Is this reverse Shakespeare? Where were the homoerotic undertones? What is happening?!? Positives: the Italian cast members were all fantastic, and every scene was beautifully manicured and framed. Sigh.
0	The Rookie is one of many TV series with an interesting premise but poor follow through. The recent episode where armed robber suspects were unhandcuffed so one could propose to the other is when the Rookie jumped the shark. In earlier episodes, the training officers worked hard to correct every mistake, but in this scene the TO was an eager participant. Make no mistake, this incident would have a strong impact on the career of everyone involved. No police officer would uncuff one hand of a suspect and leave the open cuff dangling. That loose cuff is a deadly weapon.
2	This show is damn near perfect.Yes, I agree that the eighth season was not the best, and was by far the worst of them all, but people seem to love to forget that up until the final season, David and Dan gave us one of the most popular, most critically acclaimed, and most respected TV shows ever.The acting was always brilliant. Even in the face of bad lines or story beats, the actors in this series make it work as best they can, and they do it very well. The casting was done so well that to a lot of people, these characters are inseparable from they actor they are portrayed by. As someone who has read the books as well as watched the show, I can confirm this.90% of the time, the writing was brilliant and perfect. The writers created a story that, while being a retelling of a famous book of the same name, had its own unique twists and turns, and captivated millions of people worldwide for nearly a decade. That's nothing to scoff at. That's very impressive.Cinematography, special effects, editing, directing, and all of the other things that make for a great show are done masterfully the whole way through. You just can't get enough of it. Even in the earlier days of the show, when the budget was much smaller, the team managed to make it engaging, entertaining, suspenseful, dramatic, and all-around spectacular. The score done by Ramin Djwadi is incredible and iconic. All these things carried over from season 1-8 (besides the significant drop in writing quality in the last season).Overall, this show is worth your time. I think that part of the reason so many people hated the final season was because, when you compare it to the previous seven, the writing took a major tumble. But if you look at it with an open mind, without the need to constantly compare and rank, it's an enjoyable season for the most part. But I agree that it's nothing compared to the ones that came before. Game Of Thrones came so close to being the greatest show in history, and just a bit more effort could have gotten it there.
2	Seasons 1-4: 10/10 The first four seasons of GoT are not only the best seasons of television of all time, they rival cinema with regards to their epic storytelling and production values. They are brilliant adaptations of the first three books in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, staying largely faithful while making the necessary changes and even improving and enhancing the source material at certain points. There are so many incredible plot twists, character moments, dialogues and set pieces and it is never once boring or rushed.Best episodes: S1: Baelor S2: Blackwater S3: The Rains of Castamere S4: The Lion and the RoseS5: 7/10 Season 5 is the first season that disappointed me. Not that it was bad, but it was not up to par compared to the (admittedly very high) standard set by the previous four. The first six episodes are slow, and certain storylines such as the Dorne storyline were messy and not well handled. Barristan Selmy's death was stupid, pointless and totally out of character, and a clear sign of the shock-value-over-quality that would plague future seasons. Also, S5 marks the first real noticeable dip in the quality of the writing, as the dialogue was weaker and characterizations began to suffer a little. However, I must admit that this is true for books 4 and 5 as well. They were not nearly as strong as the previous three, and due to them being split geographically instead of narratively they were much harder to adapt. Even narratively they did not progress the story enough. Still, this does not excuse the mediocre writing of the TV season.The saving grace of S5 are the last four episodes, which were considerably better, moved things forward and contained some truly epic moments. The Hardhome episode was excellent and a great deviation from the source material, Cersei's conflict with the High Sparrow and her walk of shame was very well done, and the meeting between Tyrion and Daenerys was great. However, other storylines did suffer, most notably Stannis' entire storyline at Castle Black, which, apart from a brilliant scene where he burns his daughter as a sacrifice for the Lord of Light, ended up being pointless as he was killed off without at least giving us a proper battle. Also, Daenerys struggle with the Sons of the Harpy in Meereen was mostly boring, but then again her storyline was not much better in book 5.Overall, S5 was still a pretty decent season of television, but it was not nearly as satisfying as I was expecting.Best episode: HardhomeS6: 6/10 Season 6 was the first season not based on the ASOIAF books, and it showed. Although the season contained some epic moments, it unfortunately continued the downward spiral of the show's quality that began in S5. The season included a lot of payoff for storylines developed in earlier seasons and stuff set up by S5, but the writing was even worse than in the previous season and the show began to feel even less like the GoT of S1-4.The bad writing that began in S5 is even more noticeable here, as many characters make stupid and illogical decisions and a lot of subplots were rushed although most ended satisfyingly. Inconsistent and lazy writing, ridiculous scenes (such as Daenerys's entire sequence with the Dothraki and her burning down the temple, and House Dorne being overthrown in one simple short scene in the season premiere) and stupid off-screen deaths ensued. Arya's stint with the Faceless Men in Braavos ended poorly and gave us the first truly annoying use of plot armor. Hodor's big moment was fun and unexpected (if a bit random), but it did introduce the element of time travel which the show would completely ignore in the next two seasons. Battle of the Bastards was visually stunning and fun to watch but suffered from subpar writing and plot armor, and the Meereen subplot was resolved way to easily. But luckily, the season ended on a high note with the last episode, which started with the best set piece of the later seasons with Cersei blowing up the sept, and included the reveal of Jon's parentage (if only it would ultimately mean something). Thus, there were just enough epic moments and revelations to keep us mostly happy and excited for what's to come.Best episode: The Winds of WinterS7: 4/10 Season 7 was a crushing disappointment and gave me the first serious indication that my favorite show would likely end very poorly. The first sign was that there were only 13 episodes left over two seasons, which is way too little considering all the plots that needed to be resolved. Obviously, this would mean that the show runners would rush everything. The first episode was very weak and did not move the story forward at all, which was very odd considering there were only six episodes left in the season. The only real highlights in the season were Lady Olenna's final moments and the visually stunning Loot Train Attack sequence. Episode five completely ruined everything with the most idiotic plan ever conceived in the show (capturing a white walker), courtesy of Tyrion no less. Tyrion has become such a stupid character since he left Westeros, a shell of his former self who now just drinks and makes juvenile jokes. The Beyond the Wall episode was an illogical, poorly written mess with Marvel-esque action, plot armor, teleportation and contrived nonsense. The season finale was ruined by the ridiculous death of Littlefinger that was a betrayal of his character; only decent scene was Jaime leaving Cersei.Best episode: The Queen's JusticeS8: 2/10 I am not going in depth on S8, enough people have already done that and made analyses on the absolute dumpster fire this final season was. All I'm going to say is that S8 is a complete disaster, the most disappointing thing I've ever watched and one of the worst seasons of TV I've ever seen. It completely ruined the entire show and all its wonderful characters beyond repair and it crushed my heart and soul. The only reason it does not get a 1/10 is because of the hard work of the entire cast and crew who made sure the season at least looked as good as it did, sounded as well as it did, and was acted as strongly as possible, even in spite of the absolutely idiotic writing they had to deal with. What a shame.Best episode: A Knight of the Seven KingdomsIt could have been the greatest show ever made, but D&D unfortunately sabotaged their own show and disrespected George and the fans. All we can do now is hope the books will be finished one day, but considering it has been two and a half years since the show ended and book 6 is still nowhere in sight, I'm not optimistic we will ever get a proper ending.Overall rating: 7.4 (rounded up to 8 due to the sheer brilliance of S1-4)
0	Season 17 is Awful! Just what this country needed more Negative political trash and trying to pit races against one another. I couldn't even watch the ending, it was so painful and frustrating. My teenagers loved this show but I am not allowing them to watch this trash. Trying to teach them unity instead of hate. Sorry to Doctors Weber, Bailey and Grey who got pulled down by this sinking ship!
0	Perhaps I'm not being as objective as i could, even then this amazing series is one of the most stunning TV shows, don't know in the future, but right now its possible and probably the best TV series.GOT haven't point of comparison with other series like breaking bad, homeland, mad men, I'm sorry for those who like this series but they just not as good as GOT, don't matter what the EMMY's says, i like to believe that we already know how the EMMY's usually works for the benefit of just a few. talking about braking bad, or mad men that i also enjoy, are a really good TV shows but also are more popular, made with the objective of make more people to like it without being too risky or controversial, or mature, I know that GOT its some times harder to watch (for some people) because this series wasn't made for everyone, was made to be the best show, something like no other TV show, epic, savage, crude, and surprisingly real in the human behavior, of course attached to a fantasy story with dragons, magic, epic battles, and so many secrets to discover.I literally don't have all the correct adjectives or words to describe it (english is not my native language) and even if i loose some objectivity rating this a 10 over 10, the great work that all the people involved put in this series deserves no less than a 9 rate in a movie/series rater website, considering that if u give it a 9 that will mean that there is no other series capable to have the same rate.In all aspect, from technical, sound, video, editing, mixing, direction, cast, actresses and actors, story, plot, script... in every single aspect it's a flawless piece of work.Just want to say Thanks! to George R. R. Martin for write this great story., and to Emilia Clarke just thank you for existing and being part of GOT.Thank you to all of you in Game of Thrones.
2	So much to admire and enjoy about this series!1. Much has already been written about the cinematography, and it is, to be sure, one of the most gorgeous works of cinema to appear in years. Significantly, the black and white approach is not only artistic, but it also powerfully reinforces a sense of a time (early 1960's) many decades removed from our present so it serves the story very well in that regard by conveying the sense of a clearly period piece.2. The acting is remarkably disciplined, and while the dialogue is beautifully crafted to enhance the sense of uneasiness and mistrust among the characters, it is sparse, so that the actors portray as much if not more with their unspoken expressions as they do with their lines. Very skillful performances from all.3. Direction and editing is refreshingly unhurried and is perfectly suited to the leisurely existence of people who have very little with which to occupy themselves. Lonliness and isolation make for slow times, and the pacing here reflects that reality, even though the series doesn't drag... it remains suspenseful and maintains one's interest as a result of the great craftsmanship.
1	You messed up the show with season 8. I bought my favorite popcorn and my favorite drink, then sat in my favorite chair to see my favorite show. When I was done, I almost choked on everything at once. Boooooo, boooooo, boooo
1	I've enjoyed watching the fantastic cast bring game of thrones to life. I have huge respect for all the actors for their portrayals of the characters, they have been brilliant. Seasons 1-6 were great... 7, ok, But season eight, the jewels on game of thrones' crown get written. As with everything in life, it could turn out any which way... and the writers decide to tie it up like they do. I feel for fans of the show that waited like I did for every season, every episode, but I am most of all bitterly disappointed for the cast who didn't get the conclusions they deserved.
0	This has been one of my favorite police dramas over the past couple of years. The acting and direction have been compelling and the plots well balanced. Turning the show into a social justice psychodrama has been severely damaging . One hopes it can get back to its roots and go from virtue signaling to riveting crime drama. Before this sharp swing to the left I would have given it a 9.
2	But older and wiser than the stunning character he played in the perfect 10 Firefly. So, I am always honest in my ratings. I admit to adding two whole stars just to watch Nathan Fillion again in something a bit more serious and hard hitting than Castle. This is not a perfect show. But if you had to pick an actor to pull off a 40 something rookie in a police precinct, I'd START with Fillion and pray he'd take the role (which he did!).To be fair, the multi race cast of The Rookie are also fantastic. Sometimes when I watch a show that ticks off all of Hollywood's boxes (not necessarily the VIEWERS boxes, however), I can't watch it because it CAN come off a bit preachy. But Nathan Fillion is the Fred Astaire of the acting profession. He could act with a cardboard box and it would be wonderful. He mixes in just the right amount of hubris, humility and humor to make you fall in love with his character, John Nolan.However, all that being said, I must give a shout out to other fine actors who make up this ensemble cast, which despite Fillion's huge screen presence, also shine brightly in this show. Richard T. Jones plays Sargeant Wade Grey, a serious, skeptical but honorable head of the division the three rookies are in. In the beginning, he was sure Nolan would wash out within a week. As the episodes rolled on, a sort of mutual respect and friendship grows between them, a high five for BOTH actors for the ability to pull this off in such a slow, but very sweet fashion. The other two rookies and each of the three teaching partners are excellent in their roles and at times, even Fillion's story takes a second place to their stories.Great scripts, great directing (the seams of the show never fray even though each episode has a different director), beautiful Southern California scenery, cinematography, and a storyline that keeps advancing without missing any steps along the way. Watching these relationships change and grow as the season has gone on, is a pleasure. We watch a lot of shows. But there are only three we pick the night after it's recorded - The Resident, Criminal Minds, and The Rookie. (I want to add Manifest as well, even though the season has ended and we still have no idea if it will be picked up again - PLEASE PICK IT UP AGAIN?).With all of this, The Rookie still hasn't found its audience and the ratings are not as high as they should be. But I keep thinking back on NCIS - and even Criminal Minds - neither a blockbuster the first season. Back then, the producers and networks took a chance on a highly rated show as The Rookie, which currently is at 8.0 on IMDb's own rating system. The only thing I am wondering about is, what happens to the name of the show when he graduates to a full fledged police officer and is no longer a rookie? My sense is HE will be given a rookie to raise if it gets renewed (which I hope it does!).I am so sick of these networks dropping some of their greatest shows. Shows like Travelers (on Netflix - one of the best sci fi shows ever and idiot Netflix cancelled it after 3 seasons. WATCH IT!), The Pretender, Journeyman, Moonlight, Forever, Threshold, Intelligence, Frequency, AND FIREFLY, and so many others cancelled after the first season with ratings at 7 plus in IMDb! I am SO hoping these people who have broken my heart too many times to count will take a chance and renew The Rookie. There are now at least FOUR knock offs of This Is Us that are getting renewed with similar ratings. The Rookie is as good as a TV show gets and deserves another season! Of course, if more people would WATCH it, and not discover it in Netflix five years down the line (like I did with Firefly), then it would be renewed. So spread the word while we still have a chance. Highly recommended! A gem of a show that just needs a chance to grow!
0	As the title states, he speaks English not Portuguese. Along all the first episode the so called translators were tasked to translate Portuguese to Japanese, but the pilot (John) speaks English. Cannot understand why such a minor detail went unnoticed. Having that said, I couldn't continue watching as it was very disappointing that something so obvious wouldn't care for the producers. It's like insulting people's intelligence. If you manage to ignore and overcome that you might enjoy the series. It doesn't look so bad, but it's not amazing. I've got to watch the old though, based on some other reviews.
2	"This is a truly stunning production.I was a little unsure about the black and white cinematography, I felt that we wouldn't get the full beauty of Italy, but you know, it really does work. It gives the film a real feel of the era it which it's set, and a somewhat menacing atmosphere.Andrew Scott, as always is sublime, he really does portray the troubled psychopath Tom Ripley so we almost feel empathy for him.My only criticism is that the casting is a little ""off"" Dakota Fanning seems terribly miscast as Marge Sherwood, she looks disinterested at best, Johnny Flynn gave us a good interpretation of the spoilt Dickie Greenleaf, but there was very little on screen chemistry between him and Dakota.My main issue with casting is that of Eliot Sumner as Freddie Miles. I totally understand why they were chosen for the role, but I personally don't think it was the right decision. Apart from questionable acting abilities, they just didn't seem to portray the arrogant, privilege and snobbiness of Freddie.Definitely watch it, it's well worth the time you will give it."
1	Eiza Gonzalez character Dr. Salazar almost ruin this show for me. Her character didn't fit well with the rest of the group. I mean this show is a solid 9 but her character made it an high seven for me because of how annoying her character was. Also, I have a question, why didn't Wade infiltrate the boat Mike Evans was on with a mold? Rather use the nano fiber to kill all them innocent people? I understand time was a factor and perhaps the San-Ti would have known there was a mold inside the ship but Wade actions were genocide like. These folks were part of a cult and perhaps brainwashed, to kill all them kids was so wrong.
1	"I'm not a die-hard Fallout fan (played only New Vegas) so not gonna clutch the pearls over the show deviating from the lore/source material. In fact from what I heard, in some cases that might even be a good thing, when it comes to Bethesda's takes on the franchise.What I do care about is a solid story that has a fair amount of logic behind it and believable and sensible characters. And in that regard, the show is just a mess.The plot is unnecessarily convoluted, with past and present stumbling onto each other, and most of the key characters' motives remaining unclear pretty much up until the last episode of S1, which ends with a weak and ridiculous pop. And after that a lot of questions are still left to the viewer's best guesses and hopes that it will get resolved in the following episodes.Overall I don't understand the allure of these types of twisted narrations where the viewer is supposed to not understand a good half of what's going on on the screen. How is that satisfying to anybody? Why can't you just write some believable and relatable characters, surviving in the wasteland, making tough choices, and ""leveling up,"" just like the game?Or take ""The Boys"" - there is an element of mystery but most of it is pretty clear and fair to the spectator, and that doesn't hurt the show.7 for the acting, scenery, VFX, camera work and gore. With these writers and showrunners, if the series goes on, I assume it will only get worse."
1	"This TV show used to be the best hospital drama. I used to follow it up and even though there were some unrealistic situations or whatever because it was still great to just sit and watch it this. It used to be full of interesting and real diseases and finding the right diagnosis, therapy along with the struggle of residents which is just making it more personal. It also made many people want to be a doctor as far as I know, but know it's getting really downside. The drama is too boring and repeating, lovestories even more and there is no real ""medical"" drama anymore. It only happens to be in the hospital but it could be anywhere else and would be the same. Such a shame...I need to find some other medical series."
1	"The first season was obviously the best season cause it was focused on the rookies, training and the plot was entertaining. A rookie cop dealing with everyday issues on the street.But the show has become less entertaining as they're just focusing on BLM nonsense. It's funny how almost all dangerous criminals are white and the the other ones play the victim card. They're either ""pushed"" in the wrong direction or wrongfully accused. The whole 4th season was just too political. The guy robs a liquor store and almost kills the owner, and they were like oh he didn't mean it. Another one steals a police helicopter and nothing happens.They just need to focus less on the political push and focus more on the entertaining sides."
1	9 near perfect episodes then one of the worst endings of all time. The ending doesn't fit in with the show, they completely write the Anjin differently, right from the word go showing he gets back to England a grows old a feeble. Toronaga is revealed to be a power hungry warlord, which wasn't hinted at at all before this. It might have been a great twist if they had lent into it. Instead this amazing show ends with a whimper. The immense sacrifices that so many Honorable characters made turn out to be for nothing but one man's grab for power, a man who apparently has been secretly a sociopath the whole time who didn't care about the people who loved him and the dream of a free Japan. But if this was his character arc why when completely alone at his son's and best friend's funeral did he say to himself that their sacrifice would not be wasted. I'm so so sad and angry about this. The writing before this was truly incredible, it feels like the last episode was purposely tanked or written by a completely seperate group who hasn't seen the series up to that moment.This could have been a truly iconic series, a landmark in cinema and they spat on the ashes of what they had created.Definitely watch the show, just never watch the last episode.
2	I would give this an easy 10/10.. if season 8 didn't exist. But it does, unfortunately.Season 1-6 10/10 Amazing, complex dialogue and intriguing logical story lines with strong character developments, shocking emotional moments and insane action scenes.Season 7- 8/10 - still really good but seemed rushed and had some illogical moments that made no sense like the Ayra/Sansa fall out and the time/teleporting issues beyond the wall which revealed some lazy writing. But all in all filled with great moments and good set up for the final season.Season 8- 2/10. I actually don't know where or start. Season 8 is a joke. Terrible writing. Nothing makes sense. The writers have butchered most character developments and given hardly any satisfying conclusions to their story arcs.Brans story had no pay off at all and his whole role as the 3 eyed raven proved pointless against the Night King.Jaime's redemption arc was cut off instantly with real no reason.The Night Kings death was underwhelming. Infact all of episode 3 was poor, with no real structure and poorly written end to the main story line of the show. The battle was shockingly illogical and horrendous tactics. Zero white walker fights, limited deaths and ridiculous plot armour. Also editing was poor- some moments characters would be surrounded by hundreds of wights but then the next shot they were all gone. The plot armour ruined the battle of Winterfell. 'All' the Dothraki wiped out in seconds yet Samwell Tarly can fend them off. Laughable.No Sansa and Cersei interaction of any sort which I would have liked to have seen. Although I appreciate this is just my personal disappointment rather than poor writing.-Rhaegal taken down by first 3 shots, yet Drogon dodges an Iron fleets worth of Scorpions at Kings Landing, just to serve the plot. I guess Euron forgot about Dany's dragon and her forces.-Jon does nothing all season (why was he resurrected if he didn't end the long night or atleast become King? The whole point of his resurrection is because the lord of light claimed he was needed alive). Speaking of Jon, what was the point of his lineage? It didn't change anything apart from give us unconvincing tension between him and Danaerys. I kind of like Danaerys going mad but it needed a lot more time and thought put into it - It went too far too fast with no substantial development to justify her killing thousands of innocent people. Again, Laughable. It needed seasons of planning and transitioning her character. After Dany's death it just skipped to Tyrion's trial and no one seemed phased over her death.Anything that required any thought from the Writers was done off screen, like Arya and Sansa finding out about Jon's lineage.Cersei, the clever mastermind who always has a deceitful plan up her sleeve does nothing but stand looking out of a window all season. What a waste of a character.Ayra does not use her faceless abilities. How cool would it have been for something like Ayra shockingly kills Jaime in order to get his face and uses it to get close to cersei, she thinks she is safe then is stabbed whilst in the arms of her 'brother' who reveals to be Ayra. Atleast something like that may have been more satisfying a few bricks falling onto her.Bran becomes king. Urghhh. He literally said countless times he could not be lord of winterfell or rule anymore. Why the sudden change of heart? No explanation? Oh typical.Prince that was promised? Oh yeh let's forget about that too. Haha we fooled you audience.However, my main issue was not with what happened but with how it all happened. Rushed and made no sense.Major let downs and bad dialogue throughout. There are some good moments like Brienne being Knighted, but even that becomes ruined when she sleeps with Jaime- their relationship was so much nicer just being about honour and respect for one another. Have to appreciate effort by cast, visual and music crew and the few decent scenes as a whole.Overall- 9/10 purely on S1-7.
0	Why can't anything be made without so much sex and nudity ?! This is a great show so far , but the women nudity is not necessary! I'm so tired of everything needing to have it . I don't mind if a show needs to show chemistry with characters but it's really not necessary here. Game of Thrones is disgusting as well . There is just no need for so much of it every single episode. Im disappointed. Was just wanting to watch this with my kid who loves this type of thing but with the nudity I hesitate. Yeah it can be skipped but I feel I'm so over needing to be careful. For once a decent show can be decent with NO NUDITY!! It's always women too . Ughhhhh , disappointed.
1	There's no discussion about the suberb camera work and the clever use of black and white to capture the smaller and more claustrophobic world of the 1960es. The series has an authentic feel of European films of that time. Very well done. That said, why? Highsmith did not write Ripley in black and white, nor did Caravaggio paint in black and white. An alternative artistic rendering of these works over the course of 8 hour-long episodes? That said, my biggest problem is that Andrew Scott, as brilliant an actor as he is, A. Is way too old to credibly play a fellow student of Dickey, which makes everybody look like fools, and B. He plays Tom without the empathy that you need in order to cheer for a charmless murderer over the span of 8 hour-long episodes. If noir was intended, it does not work for me, I simply do not care for the Tom Ripley he portrays, and keep thinking why he wasn't left in the gutters of New York, contrary to the Tom Ripley that Patricia Highsmith wrote about.
2	"Ripley is a captivating and thrilling series that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The complex and enigmatic character of Tom Ripley is truly brought to life with incredible depth and charisma, making it impossible to look away. The multiple plot twists and turns are executed masterfully, keeping the audience guessing and engaged throughout the series. The acting is superb, the stunning cinematography makes every scene incredible, and a top-notch storytelling makes this binge-worthy. Without a doubt, ""Ripley"" deserves a clear 9- star rating for its exceptional quality and compelling narrative. Highly recommended for anyone that enjoys a gripping and sophisticated drama.The one reason this does not meet its otherwise clear ten star: The pacing was a tad drawn out. I would argue 6 episodes may have been a batter timeline, though it is a challenging line to walk between pacing and fleshing out the series."
1	I would watch anything featuring Nathan Fillion in even a minor role so, naturally, I gave this show a chance. And was more than a little disappointed. It has most of the necessary elements including a strong supporting cast. It's filmed in LA which I love. But it just misses out. The writing isn't strong but that could be partly because you're taken in too many directions during an episode. By trying to follow all of the partners in different situations it doesn't allow you to get invested in any of them. There seems to be little in the way of music, whether it be scoring or simply songs to underscore the drama and I find this to be a huge deficit. The right music in the right moment really cements the scene in your mind. The cast is strong but does Richard T have another expression? I'd love to see it sometime. Ultimately The Rookie is entertaining enough, but a bit of a letdown.
2	So far, this series is shaping up to be the next great, I really hope it continues down this path as it has a very strong start with the first two opening episodes. Shogun offers a brutally real look at feudal life without the romanticisation often seen in media set in this period of Japan.I am watching this without watching the older show or reading the novel so am going in blind, so far everything from the sets, the outfits and weaponry are all impressive.As someone who missed out on the hype of some of the big culture hitting shows such as GoT. I intend to stay on the ride for this one! Time will tell if this ends up being the case but so far it certainly is looking promising.Very good start and look forward to more!
1	Easy to watch, good cast , interesting story-line..but scenes are wrong /mis produced and break the the effect .
0	I loved this program, but this last season is awful, COVID and RACE, it used to be fun to watch, now it's like watching the news, can't watch anymore.
0	Being totally unaware that the story comes from a trilogy of books, I liked the IMDb synopsis and went for it. First episode I accepted would be more of an introduction to get to know the players, which it was. But the second episode was just as slow and one didn't know what the story was really going to be about. As I like a good sci fi show, the bits that were uncovered were real quantum stuff and not a lot of nonsense. Alas the show was spoiled by too much talking and too much irrelevant other happenings to fill an episode. I started losing interest by episode five but continued binge watching. Eventually we learnt of the true nature of this story and I was keen to see what the threat looked like, but for that we have to wait for season 2. Pity, season 1 could have earned a higher star rating from me if it was faster paced and not full of conversation, which was often boring to watch. Never the less, I eagerly await season two, which can only be a vast improvement of this introductory season, being drawn-out disappointing.
2	"Grey's Anatomy is sometimes considered a ""chick flick"" or a ""girly"" show. That is the furthest thing from the truth. The surgical cases are all very interesting, even though it can be far fetched at times. The romantic-drama is obviously a big part if what makes the show interesting, especially for female audiences, but it makes for great suspense on what will happen next. It sucks that George died early as he was one of the main characters that seemed like he'd last in the show forever - same goes for Izzy and Christina. I personally really liked Dr. Burke as I thought he played a great role in the show. The good thing is, characters come and go so with how the story has gone it isn't impossible for some of the former main characters to come back. The only stale season in the show in my opinion was when Derek died. After that and onward into the next season it didn't feel the same. It definitely made for an adjustment when watching the show but it eventually blew over. Season 16 was one of the best seasons yet with all of the relationship drama with Owen and Teddy, and with Teddy being pregnant and falling for both Owen and Tom Koracick. The cliffhanger at the end of Season 16 with Owen canceling the wedding was quite interesting. I don't want to mention the situation with Richard as someone reading this review may not be that far yet (no, he doesn't die). I'm really looking forward to the next season in this series."
0	"No...seriously...that wasn't a rhetorical question...what was that show?! I must confess that I only managed to put myself through three episodes of this atrocity before I could endure no more and gave up. It has been a while since I have seen anything this bafflingly bad, a big mess, a disjointed cacophony passing as content. Imbued and drenched with all the modern day ideological tropes and virtue signaling, bereft of anything resembling creativity or originality... and more importantly quality.I honestly don't care about the video games. I have no personal attachment to this IP, was only marginally familiar with the lore, so I approached this show as a newbie with no prior expectations. Therefore, I am only looking at this as a series, which I had hoped would be at least entertaining, containing a good story and interesting characters. None of that available here. Quite the opposite.A waste of time and brain cells. I'd like to say more but I feel my IQ dropping when I spend ANY time thinking or talking about ""Fallout""."
1	"Idea, plot, characters are very good. First two seasons absolutely amazing. I would agree with all recent comments about extreme (seriously just do it in one episode and be done) presence and ""shoving"" of ""woke"" culture into your throat in majority of third season. I'll give it another last chance after episode 8 and if they keep pushing, I'll just stop watching. That easy!"
2	It seems like some people here should expose themselves to classic noir films and books this series finds its inspiration in. Folks criticizing the internal dialogue, that's a time-honored device of the genre as is, a slow burn pace and flashbacks. Maybe people these days are too accustomed to explosions and car chases to appreciate a little mystery. Read some Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett or watch a Robert Mitchum or Humphrey Bogart movie in the genre. Farrell is definitely well cast and the cinematography is sumptuous. I'm excited to see where this series takes us. We were glued to the screen and can't wait for me.
1	Nathan Fillion is entertaining, but there are times when it feels like the writers are mailing it in. If a car is headed East and makes a right turn, the car is not now going North. C'mon!
1	"They packed a LOT into this first episode, but I enjoyed it thoroughly! This is 100% a Nathan Fillion show, so if you're not a fan of his bemused quality, you'll want to skip this. I only hope they'll keep morality plays, politics, and ""grand messages"" on the back burner - - - give us quality stories, good characters, writing that respects the intelligence of the viewers, a bit of action with some humor thrown in for good measure, and you'll have a loyal following....."
1	First thing first, if you never read the book, it's not a bad show, some Chinese actors really shine in it but the rest are not much to write home about. The children were pretencious and the writing was a bit lazy. But all in all it's an enjoyable show.If you read the book like I did, you might be put off a little cos it's not exactly how it was in the book, it's way faster paced and of course will skip a few things here and there, the biggest issue is introducing so many new characters NOT from the book, however I understand where the director(s) were coming from - to tell the story in such a pace you need a few different aspects, I also understand the reason why it's fast-paced, as 1, audience nowadays have a short attention span (thanks to all the short vids apps), 2. It costs a lot of money to produce shows like this, and having too many episodes is not economically feasible.2 episodes in and I am actually liking it, so here's a 6.5, hopefully the rest will be better.
1	"This is a ""hard-to-review"" TV show in my opinion. My father was a police officer for almost 20 years, had some extreme case, like a serial killer that he found, or a car chase, which went for almost 50km. He had a gunfight, which is really rare in my country. But most of the time it wasn't this action packed. And here comes my issues with almost any cop/investigation series. Reality.And that is something which got me into this show. Reality. The episode, where *Spoiler* Nolan kills someone really something, that my father experienced. That episode really got me. Also, the psychological side of the show is amazing, I really enjoy the dynamic between characters, especially the TOs.But my problem with the show is... Well the lack of reality. After season 2 it feels like it fell apart. Season 3 was okay, but after that, it has no logic and sometimes the timeskips aren't really obvious. Also, my biggest logical issue is *Spoiler* Chen wants to become an undercover agent, after she was on 2 documentaries and a nationwide hostage drama. Basically everyone saw her on TV. Also, there are way to much action going on for my liking. When watching it, I was afraid, that it will become just another Crime/Action show, which it kind of did. But the last episode of season 5 is the best episode of the show, for me at least.And let's talk about the chemistry. Chenford is something I really enjoy, that's the best chemistry in the show by far. And yet again, in the first 2 seasons, the chemistry is great. Every couple on screen is fine. But after that, something is wrong. Only Chen and Bradford works as a couple for me. Also the dynamic between the officers are basically non existent at this point.If I would have to review the series, I would give it a 9 to S1 & S2, 7 for S3, and 5 for S4 and S5."
0	I forgot how bad the downfall was.It's much easier to notice the decline in quality when you binge watch it.You can spot the show slowly start going to sewer even in season 5, with that being confirmed over and over again in season 6.Then comes the 7 & 8 and oh my, oh my.The bad dialog is what hurts the most. In the earlier seasons you can spend 40 minutes watching the characters just engage in conversation, it was that clever, but then the writers run out of books and they try to be what they were hired to be. A writers.But unfortunately the writers were too dumb and have no imagination to keep the standards that the books set previously, so you get the characters completely devoted of their true personality, and all the character development just gets thrown out of the window.Plot holes, the power of teleportation, forgetting about storylines, just terribly bad.It is unbelievablly sad to watch this TV phenomenon fall apart in front of your very own eyes.Shame.Unfortunately, I don't think GRRM will ever finish the books, with him being old and fat, he will probably die before that, and we will never get the closure we deserve.
1	Grey's was great in the beginning and has definitely gotten cheesier and more ridiculous with each passing season, but now it's just so topical and political. Watching an over the top season filled with Covid ridiculousness was the last thing I wanted to watch while Covid was happening. I wish the show wasn't so extremely left leaning because it would be more enjoyable if it wasn't.
0	Sick, just sick, according to this TV-drama life sucks. I'm a MD myself and the content is straight for Hollywood, everybody makes love to everybody, the ones we love are dying away, well could watch The Hollywood Reporter instead! We just finished the second season, I must admit that I keep on watching, hoping that at least something goes better, but...it's getting worse & worse. Maybe we should lower the therapeutic costs for the writer, then we could have the chance to get a little more hope that it is worth to live ans work as a doctor. Why must everything concerning medicine be cynical & stupid(like Scrubs) or chaotic negative (like ER). Is this what you want to see as a revenge for the US-medical insurance system? Give you a completely wrong view of the hospital system, plenty of brainless prejudices. The first episode was hard and out of reality, after some smalltalk and love matters the depression goes on. If you ever failed getting on a medical university, you will like it, as it shows you a wrong life nobody would choose, if not completely insane. The best answer to the jealousy towards MDs. The best serial if you like getting depressed...
2	My rating for this series was a 10/10 until the final season. I avoid thinking about the show after I turned off the TV, put down the remote, left the room, and shut the door behind me. I don't even want to touch the DVD which is why they're still even on the shelf.Watching the final season was like watching a train speeding towards a broken bridge, and realizing too late that you are on the train.The plot is forced (to end the show), the acting is forced (to follow the plot), and the characters are forced (to die). I haven't read the books, was planning to, but now can't bear to be reminded of the bad taste that's still in my mouth. I hope the books have a better ending, they really deserve a better ending, we all do.
1	I've read the book several times and have the original miniseries on dvd. On the whole, I'm glad I've watched this new version. The modern production techniques make the original series look somewhat dated; however, I think that already being a fan may have detracted from the experience. The book is fantastic and the original miniseries is much closer to the book. In this new version I was regularly filling in gaps and there were a few changes to the the storyline that I found jarring.If you've never read the book or seen the original miniseries you'll likely find this new adaptation enjoyable, otherwise you may, like me, find it a little disappointing and already planning to re-read the book and watch the original.
0	"I guess reviews for the show are written by die-hard fans. Or maybe people now ready to eat-up whatever content, they can get, that looks good. I mean it, the show does look great. It gets post-apocalyptic aesthetics to the T, and is filled with little details that are capable to tell a story of their own. In a game this would be a real achievement, and it was: even though I never got into Fallout series, I can admit, that it had high detalization of the world through-out. At least in the main series games, that I did try.But even for a game it's not enough: you need a good story, and good gameplay there, too. I never liked the gameplay part of the series, it just did not click with me unlike The Elder Scrolls, but TV shows don't need to bother with that. TV show creators' job is much easier then, right?In my opinion, these TV show creators fail at their job. I often complain about series, that have too much talking without using visual to tell the story. This one is the reverse: there is too little of talking, or at least of talking that would develop character, world of move plot along. Some reviewers did notice this as well, pointing out, that it feels like screenwriters were writing for a game, and for TV.If this was a short movie, this might have been fine, but for TV show - not so much. For me it was boring. Only the first part of the 1st episode was somewhat interesting to me. It was a cliche, but still a good starting point for a story: a sheltered society gets raided, and that forces a character (or characters) to go outside of that society and learn about the world. But then we switch to part of that outside world, and it's not as interesting.It's not just Brotherhood of Steel, but the outside world in general. The creators are trying too hard to make it look ""uncivilized"" or ""militaristic"" or ""sterile"" or just ""weird"", and as result it all feels forced. As if they had a list of things to show, and they progressed through the story by checking items off that list.At the least, I think they should have used just 1 main plotline with the girl leaving shelter. It could have become a travel-show with fish-out-of-the-water theme, and each episode could have explored all the weirdness of this strange world, while the girl was moving forward. You know, a bit like The 10th Kingdom back from 2000, but post-nuclear. Alas, we have what we have. As is, I would rather rewatch Silo. It was not a perfect show, but it was much more interesting to me."
0	This shows has very predictable, low tier writing and completly retcons the story for an arguably worse version to fit a new vision for the series. I wish for a destruction of bethesda offices and for the director to publicly apologise for the mutulation of this series. The characters are bland and stale and the plot feels lazy and stretched out. This show has no innovation and will not be remembered within next 2 months. This is a massive letdown and has not reached any expectations, it has went below them. I wish in the future shows such as this are not allowed by law and their creators publicly shamed and inprisoned.
0	Started great, last 2 seasons were so bad that I can imagine ever watching it again.Compare that to BSG, Breaking Bad, or even Lost and it's obvious that this is not worth wasting your time on.
1	"Having played most of the games, I went in expecting more ""halo""esque content, virtue signalling to the usual people who won't be watching because too many white people or whatever bonkers things goes through their minds, but slipping easter eggs from the actual game as breadcrumbs so we can all ignore our own amazon vault-tec feeding us our programming.And it does indeed deliver all of that.Whether it's the brotherhood cadet with pronouns everyone seems to respect because tolerance is really one of the building blocks of steel.. :P Whether it's the shrewd business woman and her lesbian partner in filly who's basically the railroad for wayward enclave scientists.Whether it's the rebranding of communism..It's all there in it's self righteous glory.That said though, the story is about Lucy, who was raised in a vault, with an apparent significant amount of inbreeding that doesn't seem to be touched upon too much, beyond ""messing around with your cousins"". Though it might explain her freakishly large eyes?She has all the subtle hints at S. P. E. C. I. A. L, which suggests she's low S, mid P, lowish E, high C, low I, low A and maxed L. If you know, you know.Her vault 33 is, allegedly, linked to two other vaults 31 and 32, and to combat inbreeding they import breeders from other vaults to carry on the american gene, so one day they can come out of the vaults and reclaim the surface.But alas, this is a ploy of the villain/hero/visionary. Lee Moldaver, played by mediocre actress somethingsomething who cares, she's barely on camera. But she's super scary, everyone says so.. like the 3 times someone talk about her through the entire season.. What we do learn is that Lucy's dad, the overseer of vault 33, KNOWS HER, intimately.. so.. naturally he warns everyone.. oh no wait.. I guess the writers forgot, so he just neglected to tell anyone.. and gets a load of his dwellers killed and himself kidnapped so the plot can happen.Naturally Lucy but also the most useless members of vault 33 survive.. somehow.. and suddenly has an effective security force.. somehow, and doesn't want to rescue her father, so with the help of her kissing cousin and confused looking brother she escapes the vault to go looking for him.From then on it is.. somewhat chaotic where the show goes.Maximus the storm trooper.. sorry brotherhood of steel cadet selling out his comrades the second he is free to, instantly falling for Lucy was uh... necessary for the cringy power armor scenes and needed to be tied together somehow. Also some gratuitous male nudity scenes inbetween. Gotta have those.Cooper Howard AKA The Ghoul, hunting for the mcguffin because he has backstory reasons, really. His story isn't great to be honest, though the actor did what he could with the material. Easily the best character of the show.It scrambles the lore from the games into whatever amazon wants, changing the entire canon from China dropping the bombs because the US was developing supersoldiers, to eeeeevil corporations dropping the bombs to kill the competition.. except it turns out all the vaults are factions competing... so .. uh... factions bad except when good, because that's... that's what the writers wrote.Pitch meeting will have a field day with this.."
1	Visual translations of a work of fiction always problematic. But this version of Shogun alters too much of the original.Kudos for trying to depict the intrigues and manipulations of the Japanese nobility during this critical period in their history. The expansion of that material may help contemporary audiences.Blackthorne more of an enigma than in the novel. Yes, he finds himself in a totally alien culture. How he comes to understand it is a huge part of the story. But inventing certain characters' traits to shortcut that realization lessens his importance in the story.No need to invent material in a book that showed all the forces at work so compellingly.
1	"Science facts: alfa centaury is a two sun system with an attached red dwarf sun (Proxima centaury). And no: not all three body systems are chaotic (see Sun-Earth-Moon). Three or multi body systems used to be a scientific challenge back in the day (10th century) without computers. Some claimed it is an proof that science is not capable of being a replacement for religion. Today multi body systems can be simulated with tremendous precision for very long periods of time. Most of them are very stable. It depends on the distribution of masses. In the solar system the sun has > 99% of the overall mass which makes it stable. For Alfa Centaury this is not the case. The two suns orbit each other in a stable way. But for smaller planets there is a good chance to not have a stable orbit and sooner or later they get kicked out. Unlikely that any inhabitable planet exists there - but we don't know. The story as such has some good ideas. But as it is supposed to be close to reality (not like Star Wars or Star Trek) other stuff just doesn't fit (invisible characters etc). The acting is a little of. And there are some characters that simply slow down things without adding much for the story telling. Like with any series: every time momentum builds - it shortly after breaks down and we go back to slow story telling to get enough material for 8 episodes and potential sequels. IMHO this KILLS any good entertainment. After a while, no matter how good the ideas are, it simply get boring and one looses focus. Again: some really good story ideas but stretched out so much - all ""fire"" fades to gray."
2	"It is pretty incredible. I think this has the power to be the next Game of Thrones. Will the subtitles put people off? I hope not, but it's always a factor.I'm sure some more articulate will set up this story on here, but here's a quick paragraph:These first two episodes follow the first Englishman to cross the Japanese borders and what this means for the country. The country is in a matter of states with no appointed Shogun. After being captured by multiple parties, the Englishman brings information that the Portuguese and Spanish have ""claimed"" this part of the world saying; The kings right to claim any non-Catholic land discovered by their subjects. This infuriated the leader. Letting the Englishman ""John Blackthorne"" live, assuming to be their source of information- let's him stay on his quarters for the night. The rest I'll leave it to you to watch or find out yourself.This is epic in every sense. Perfectly balanced pacing in terms of story telling and gruesome action.All actors play their roles very convincingly, Cosmo Jarvis is channelling something between a Tom Hardy character but with a Daniel Plainview cadence of speaking. Bring on the conspiracies, politics and play for who to be Shogun.Bottom line is I love this already after 2 episodes."
1	I love crime shows, movies, and books. I like Farrell and plenty of the other actors. This show is 100% in my wheelhouse.However, after 4 episodes, I'm giving up for one simple reason: why are the episodes 30 minutes?! It's unorthodox and unnecessary. Since the renewal period of my Apple subscription was two days away, I decided to cancel rather than keep it for weeks and weeks to finish this one show. If they were proper hour long episodes I could see it being more worth my money. However, since this is literally the only good show after they cancelled Shantaram, I'd rather put my money into a more consistent service. If Shantaram had been renewed, I would not have cancelled and would have continued watching Sugar week to week.Now, I'll just log in when it's donee, watch, and cancel. In short: Apple makes some decent shows, but not enough to justify year-round no-discount subscriptions. You can literally log in for one or two months twice a year and not miss anything, especially when episodes are a half hour.
2	I must say, this show was quite challenging to watch, as I could imagine it would be for most. And yet, I was completely pulled into the story, compelled and disturbed by its characters, themes, and how brutally honest all of it was portrayed. For me, it's really a deep character study around human behaviour, the complexities and often confusing nature of the relationships we can share with other people, people we care about and love, and even people that know how to take advantage of and have power over us; for those who have watched the show, you will know which relationship in particular I am referring to.Something I just deeply loved and respected about this show was how imperfect the main character, Donnie, was portrayed as being. He was clearly a victim, but Richard Gadd didn't shy away from the wrongdoings and omissions Donnie himself engaged in throughout the show, which were clearly a response to his internal damage and trauma, but which tragically ended up damaging many of his important relationships. Additionally, the way in which Donnie could behave in his private time I thought was another disturbing, and yet refreshingly, honest portrayal of the ugly ways in which human beings can respond to trauma. The places they went in this show were just truly incredible.There are various points in the show where Donnie almost seems to overcome his damage, where he experiences a sense of release, brought about by his honesty towards himself and towards the people he cares about. But, in a beautiful subversion of the classical narrative structure or character arc which might end on the fulfilment a resolution, we find that Donnie tends to seep back into his obsessive thoughts and confused state of mind, leading back to patterns of behaviour that the audience hopes Donnie has overcome, but reality just isn't like that, humanity is much more complex, and it often takes a very long time to find true release, and Richard Gadd, in his wisdom and brutally honest self-reflection, seems to understand this, and leaves the story somewhat unresolved, but in another sense coming full circle.This is a truly, truly beautiful work. Challenging, disturbing, all the whilst being incredibly refreshing in its honesty, and also a masterclass in acting and storytelling by all involved, particularly by Richard Gadd and the marvellous Jessica Gunning. I would recommend this work to anyone who appreciates brutal honesty in art, and bravery in the creators to go where others might fear to go.
0	I confess, I've only watched one episode of this series. I cannot will myself to continue with it. The lack of chemistry from the cast is honestly jaw dropping. Ripley is far too old. His encounter with Greenleaf and Marge is weird to an extreme level. He might as well be wearing a baseball cap with the word creepy emblazoned on it. It's not believable that they'd have him for lunch, or anything else after that first encounter. The Greenleaf shipping tycoon storyline is badly led down by Ripley's initial visit to the dry dock when we see what appears to be a wooden hull fishing boat. Seriously? That's not a shipping magnate with vast wealth. The feature version got this a thousand times better on every level. It had glamour and beauty and charisma and charm and style. This has absolutely zero. B&W drains all the life out of it. Imagine going to the Italian Riviera and shooting black and white. It really symbolises the terrible missteps with this whole production. You feel no heat. No joy or beauty. Characters are pure cardboard with no soul. Just watch the original movie. Anthony Minghella (a genius) (RIP) really nailed it. Matt Damon, Jude Law and all the cast in that movie were terrific. Even Ripley's Game with John Malkovich is more deserving of your time than this. Sad.
1	Season 1 & 2 were really good - a light show with a bit of action and humour, some good characters and interesting story lines. Just what we were looking for. But season 3 is preachy and in your face to the point of being annoying. We will try one more episode, and if it continues, we're gone.
0	I am not a fan of this video game or any other. This is a dystopian fantasy series and I am a sci-fi consumer. To analyze it from the perspective of the minimum necessary to interest an adult audience is pointless. This is a product for uncritical spirits.There is a lot of blood but the action scenes are poorly choreographed, with no sense of pacing or continuity. It's all just a bunch of gags about exploding heads, shattered legs and explosive gunfire but lacking in narrative.The director (sorry, Jonathan) has no sense of story flow and splashes fades to black here and there because the script is full of holes and the stories don't string together.The plot wanders between supposed comedy and bloody space thriller without deciding on either option.The premise of the young girl leaving the shelter to find her father who has been kidnapped is as absurd as the very fact that head-busting Neanderthals have kidnapped her father.A disappointing failure for adults who love speculative fiction, science fiction and dystopias.
0	"The Portuguese speak English. Who in 2024 and in their right mind thought that this would be a good idea? Therefore the whole series is a complete clown show. It further presented in the so far published episodes a lot of flaws and illogical behavior of the characters. The story is simplified, rushed and takes stupid, unbelievable short cuts. Acting isn't that great and I cannot sense any chemistry, whether good or bad, amongst the characters, but that's probably due to the lazy script and directing. Cinematography is uninspiring and once more: who thought filming all in Canada would provide an ""authentic"" backdrop. Japan is beautiful and the film makers missed a great opportunity here. Because all of this, all portrayed feels unauthentic. Poor cast and characters. Most annoyingly Blackthorne, representing ""the English"", is just a Marty Stue, which is so utterly boring.These 10-point reviews seem fake in their vagueness and majority as there's no way that this cheap, lazy production is above a 7. IMDB is losing credibility here.I still cannot get over the fact that in the year 2024, they replace one language by English. This is extremely irritating, disappointing and blatantly ignorant and embarrassing. I'm not gonna watch more what these people create in the future. Ridiculous."
0	"Season 3 is just too damn bad. How we used to live without all the BLM movements. Femenists. LGBTQ +. And all-all-all offended people? How did we get to space? How did we overcome the Great Depression? How did we invent the internet, drugs, vaccines? Withdrawal syndrome, when for 1 ""wrong"" word everyone is ready to bury a person. Immediately break contracts, ruin life even before a court decision. Are you familiar with the term ""freedom of speech""? It seems to me that America is striving to become the second Soviet Union, with national censorship, from dispersal and in a prirpyzhku. Where everyone who does not agree with the main line of behavior will simply be expelled from the country or killed. And the first will be - heterosexual white men, the most disenfranchised inhabitants of America. Just because they are white. And men. What a nightmare. And behind all these flirting with all sorts of offended people in the third season, there is simply no time for the plot. Heroes for 45 minutes make excuses in front of everyone. This is a tragedy."
2	"Never played the game. This show is wickedly funny. There has been atomic war and now we see the future. There are ghouls, zombies, supersized bugs. Of course humans still fighting other humans.So some live in vaults. All safe and sound. One vault is raided and the head guy is taken. The episodes revolve around his daughter,Lucy trying to find him.Of course there's more to it than that. We learn about the characters backgrounds and how they came to be. We also learn how the vaults began and how they are maintained.The vaults see to be paradise but lets just say not all is well in ""paradise"" Hope to see more (NOT FOR KIDS EARNS M rating)"
2	"Tonight's episode....in a few words all I can say is WOW! I am huge fan of GA. However, i must say that I am little confused by tonight's episode. I don't know if it is the best idea to ""kill"" off one of the main characters this early in the game. Season 3 is still fairly early to start pondering with the idea of giving main people the axe. Aside from that, I am digging this story arc. It is so captivating! Qestion to the rest of you GA fans, do you think that Meredith is going to be out? Also, what is up with Izzie being all up in Callie & George's marriage? Does she want to holla at George? I guess we will have to wait and see...Kept it up Shonda!"
0	Lets be clear, i am not a hardcore fan i only watched several episodes and neither know the deep entanglement of the characters nor do i even know their names. But the things i watched left me kinda dumbstruck why this show has such a high popularity and is considered to show modern women in a modern society. The main critique doesn't even stem from the silly plots, but from the agenda and picture this series paints how modern life functions today. Especially from a womans view point. All the woman in this thing do is either argue, gossip or dish out snarky comments towards their co workers, patients or partners. I struggled to find a normal conversation that didn't evolve around those three. Sure this is meant to entertain but it would have done no harm injecting some realism into this stuff. Not every dialogue in real life is a back and forth with bitchy comments or some supposed sarcastic witty mic drops. All the woman are portrayed as this strong headed, going their own way, types who are in full control, men are only holding them back and are there for some fun between operations or to gossip about. Unless ofc fate strikes then these men are always there for a warm hug till it has blown over. The males in this series get pushed around and almost all the time mess up big time and just refuse to understand woman. The two Highlights for me in feminist propaganda and double standards were the one time that a dude almost died cause some woman beat him up (self defense my ass) and the patient got threatened that if he tried to bring her to court he will get beaten up worse by some male doctor in white knight armor. You cant be serious? Just imagine it the other way round oh boy. Second case when some red head Christian doctor lost her child and got divorced but still got pregnant from the same man. He wants to check if the baby has the same condition as the other child and thinks about aborting to spare them going through the grief again (sounds reasonable? WRONG) the female doctor proclaims with a death stare that its her body and her child so its her decission, he has no say at all. Weird I thought it takes two people to make a baby or have women suddenly developed a possibility to self fertilize? What is the message, men are mere seed donors and then they can gtfo? Also these woman superficial and hollow, no lovable bone in these hags. Cause looks in this world allow you to do anything.The characters are not likable at all the Asian doctor seems to get off on talking everybody down, the main characters acts like she has deep insight into the human mind when narrating all this BS but in the end she is just bi polar who goes from whiny wimp to arrogant hag in no time. the black plumb doctor is just obnoxious and the lesbians are just as bad as every other forced couple in this series. Which leads us to the next point the unrealistic and over the top plots. The weird thing is the patients get barely screen time and are mere vehicles for the doctors to have something to do while they talk about their love lives. What kind of hospital is this? First there are only surgeons present, no internist? No oncologists? Maybe this was explained somehow but seems just weird that every problem is solved by cutting the patient open. The patients barely get developed, they are just thrown into your face with their condition and you then watch the doctors gossip over something while they perform brain surgery. Very realistic. One episode was so ridiculous over the top, i nearly couldn't contain myself. During a big storm a whole bus of poor children crashes in front of the hospital, everybody is screaming, the main character also gets her baby and ofc the power goes out in the hospital, all at the same time. Ofc this bus is going to explode and some kids are trapped, but some hero doctor goes for saving while pulling off his shirt for the eye candy, this episode was such a big pile of garbage its borderline comedic. Other medical series at least manage to tell a more or less convincing story during the episode and give the short appearances some depth with simple measures. This show fails on all levels doing that, you don't care about the patient, you don't care about the doctors and just keep rolling your eyes in annoyance.If this is supposed to be a series from women for women i am kinda disappointed with their standards for entertainment and would advise to stick with Sex and the City, that at least had some humor in it. One star extra for the sometimes good choice of soundtrack.
0	"All stars are for the effects props and costumes which are stellar. (Discounting the face plate it's so dumb.) They ruined the most intriguing part of fallout lore, The New California Republic.Vaults in the middle of LA known post-war as the Boneyard would've been contacted by or even opened up to the NCR.The removal of mystery upon game endings and of who began the nucular exchange. (Which if it was to be revealed should have been Chinese submarines just off the coast of the US with the assistance of spys sabotaging early warning systems, like the games actually suggest opposed to redditor theory crafting.)I've never believed the conspiracy that ""Bethesda hates Fallout: New Vegas"" untill now. It feels almost like theres malicious intend toward the west coast setting of the game. If they wanted a wild setting with BoS and Enclave they could've gone with just about anywhere, except California, But no they had to rewrite NV and old lore. Literally anywhere else would've been better for the story they told. Almost as if it's just to piss us off."
2	I have NOT played this video game, much to my partner's dismay and despite his obsession with it. Its concept intrigues me, but I'm just not much of a gamer. I knew my partner was awaiting the release of this series with keen interest, and judging by the trailers I'd seen, it looked like the kind of show I'd enjoy. My only concern was if I'd be unable to appreciate it since I haven't played the game. I'm writing this for any others out there who haven't played the game but are considering checking out the show.My husband did pause the first episode at least twice to brief me on the overall timeline concept (which I do have a slight issue with.... Hard to believe that clothing, furniture and home decor wouldn't have evolved. Not to mention other fields of science... but Okey Dokey) and later the ghouls/mutants. Had he not filled me in on those items, I'm sure I could've still watched the episode through to the end without feeling too bewildered. It's also easy enough to look up some basics on the game's universe if you feel like you need to prepare beforehand.What I loved: Quick paced, sleek look, well edited, solid cast and acting, lots of action, plenty of suspense and intrigue, and a sprinkle of wry humor. The first episode introduces us to the three major characters and three vastly different settings within the story's universe. Is compelling and very well done. As the season progresses, the show gets better every episode and leaves you wanting more! It's gripping, smart, fun, thrilling, and totally binge worthy. If you are a fan of shows in the genre of post-apocalyptic settings, alternate timelines, zombies, sci fi, action, you should definitely give it a try; it lives up to the hype.And for those who have played the game, my husband said loved the show, and that there were plenty of Easter Eggs in it to appease him as a Fallout gamer fanboy. 😊
2	5 episodes in, and this is one of the most immersive seasons I have seen in a long time. Not since early episodes of GoT have I been so truly and fully immersed in the story of a season due to exceptional world-building.The creative staff of this season has gone to great lengths to stay true to the Japanese culture of the time - be it customs, costumes, and even language. The majority of the dialogue of this show is in Japanese and it adds to the richness of the whole setting. Additionally, the Japanese cast bring in much needed native flair to the screen with powerful performances.Experiencing this season as a labor of love that stays true to the source material is a breath of fresh air in the banality that is current TV.
1	This was a great show until season 3 when we start getting Hollywoodsplaning and pushing political agendas. If they continue this path, it won't be around many more seasons, which is a shame.
0	You've read the other reviews, and most of the recent ones have discussed what happened to this show since the end of season 2. I want add to it, but I'll just say I agree with all of it.If you want to watch a show about police where the show runners obviously hate the police and want them defunded, then this is the show for you.
1	"Very enjoyable show with great production value, setting and premises. Just to put aside this info - I used to play the games back in early 2000s.As a rational analyst however I had some issues with some of the important events which were not build up but relied on luck to happen. Some characters' decisions were irrational and served only to move the plot forward.Also a bit of an issue with the world building. Some characters moved from a forest areas to vast deserts without explaining how is that possible or how much time it cost.Overall - very fun and if some minor issues are fixed via hard work from ""fun"" it can become good."
2	The Rookie is one of the better cop shows on tv right now. Nathan Fillion leads a really good cast who all do a good job making this a show worth watching. Anyone who's seen Fillion in a show knows he never disappoints. This show does good job balancing drama, action, suspense and humor. It also shows how tough it is to be a police officer both at work and at home. Some of the negative reviews are from people that don't like that they take real world problems of today and apply them to the show. Everyone knows there are a thousand police shows to choose from but if you're looking for an exciting and original show then give The Rookie a try.
0	All the season after season 5 never existed, m'kay?D&D wanted to end this show as quickly as possible and it shows. I will forever be disappointed in them.
2	Six episodes in and I am really enjoying the way the show is developing. I know some people criticize the straightforward nature of the episodes but for me, there is enough backstory moving along to help me invest in the characters but it's light and in the moment enough that I'm not mucked down in complete prime time soap opera twists and turns. It's just a good fun watch that is well acted and a needed addition to TV.
1	I got hooked on the official Chinese program last year and after several episodes it stalled out and I started skipped ahead, which only made it worse. I think there was 4-5 episodes of the video game and I just couldn't be bothered. Then it got so out of hand I gave up and didn't finish.This American version looked promising from the previews, until I found out that the D&D guys that butchered the Game of Thrones series are behind this. The guys who just winged the last season of a great story, zero thinking and created the worst final season in the history of television. So yeah, there is going to be parts that absolutely make no sense so I'm prepared.I finished it and it's a decent watch. As other reviews have pointed out the casting is poor, female strong leads and bumbling men are standard as per 2020 Netflix. The dialogue is sub par with lots of buzz words. Lots of drama like a Friends episode. A few plot holes that just don't make sense which is expected with D&D running the show.It could have been really good, but these two guys just don't have the skills to make something anything better than average. I'm sure that they are wealthy enough from GoT, but they'll never get any awards.When you have an entire book series as a baseline, plus a popular Chinese television version of it for 30+ episodes it seems like you should be able to just pick out the good parts, summarize and edit. All of the heavy lifting, writing and creating is already done.I'm confident that D&D couldn't even remake Bambi to make it interesting and watchable. 5/10. Lots of chit chat and drama between the interesting scenes. Heck we even have time to chat about a goldfish.
2	You're taking an essay exam. You're really feeling it, and composing the best essay of your life. Then you get a text that you got the job you really wanted, and you dont need this stupid essay any more. You wrap everything up as quickly as you can, even if its crude and doesnt make much sense, and you run out of the classroom.Does it make the whole essay bad? No, but it goes from a 10 to an 8.
0	They destroyed the lore and decanonised fallout new vegas. Its good tv show if you forget its a fallout. Because as fallout it makes no sesne. How could Shady sands fall in 2277, just how? The NCR was fighting with Legion right after they lost the capital? And even so why is it never mentioned in the games? And dont get me started on the legion, from what people were talking it sounds like legion never existed. I dont know if the creator played the dust mod or what but now it makes sens that he doesnt care about fans opinion. He knew what the reaction of fans would be. The only explanation would be that todd wanted the show to look like it so he could finally kick new vegas out of canon. The show also have bad color palet for the fallout universe. Its a good show if you ignore the fallout part of it.
1	The hardest thing is to assign a star rating to the whole program. It was at least a 9 the first year, dropping lower and lower as the second season progressed, until the maudlin, final episodes were aired. By the last episode of the 2nd season I was rating it a couple of stars. Why does something so fresh and interesting in the first season have to deteriorate into a daytime soap? Was there simply nothing more to say? The British have a solution to this problem. They don't try to stretch out their successes over multiple seasons. They move on to another new, interesting project, rather than trying to milk a dead horse forever. And now I read other reviewers saying the third season is even worse (even from commentators who, unlike me, liked the second season). Is anyone surprised? I've gone from being a major fan to being a major detractor in just two seasons.
1	Very disappointed to see one of my favorite TV series ended like this. Two dumb screenwriters ruined it all. Agree with others, just read the books and watch season1-5, forget the rest at all.
0	"Yea the special effects arent bad, it all looks good, and for a change the acting aint that bad either, but as per usual for Amazon, the writing simply is bad, so its just really hard to take it seriously.Just aint buying it that vault 31 and 32 has ""regular"" meetings and trades, but none of the higher ups notice that they dont know a single one of the people coming over for the trade.Im sorry, but you have interacted and traded with these people all your lives, and all of suddenly all of the ones coming over are completely new faces, and no one gets suspicious?And the bad guys make it into the armory instantly?Its just typical ""bad things happen because they need it to happen for shock value, dosnt matter if it makes any sense or not""... dont bother making a show if you are not going to put any effort into the writing."
0	Q: What is more boring, watching someone play a video game or watching a series based on a video game? A: Doesn't matter, either is boring whether you've played the game or not. Doubly so if you are an actual adult. In this case the game is Fallout 3.I've played the Fallout 3 video game and I thought it was one of the best single player video games I'd ever played. So, despite it being 16 years later, I was intrigued by the concept of a TV series based upon it. But the intrigue very quickly faded. Let's face it, the plot and writing of most games works because they are games and the interaction makes up for the weaknesses in story, plot, characters, etc. A video series doesn't have the interactivity to rely upon to liven up the show and make it interesting so its usually a failure. Such is the case with Fallout, the series.What you have here is a video game walkthrough of a 16 year old game. And just like the video game it is based upon it contains adult themes and graphic violence but is written for an audience who are actually too young to watch mature rated content.I'm envisioning a couple of guys from Bethesda kicking back with a stogie and a smile thinking about how they've cashed in on the same thing so many times now they've lost count of how many billions they've made off it. People sure do love copies of copies don't they? Yup, sure do.
1	I watched 4 episodes of this series back to back after reading about the book (haven't read the book yet, no bias there). So, I am not judging it for accuracy but for whether it works or not.There are instances when it does and many more hours when it doesn't.The Chinese story is close to perfection. Acting and photography is mature and with depth. Older characters such as Cunningham, Chao, Wong and Pryce bring a lot to their roles, as well as our GoT hero John Bradley in possibly the most interesting and real character of the entire show. Alex Sharp in his melancholic role is pretty fantastic, as is the young Ye, Tseng. But it all ends there.Although the premise is quite fantastic and bold, the execution is simply very boring, unbelievable, uninteresting. The casting of Gonzales is very sad, Adepo is extremely out of place. What are they doing, how are they relevant? We will never know.I desperately wanted to see more science, but sadly, it is just the fiction we see, not the science in this sci-fi adventure.I leave 5 stars here for the amazing actors who will shine in whichever role they play.
0	Yes I endured most of this series, except the parts I slept through. I have not read the books and was initially intrigued but by about the fourth episode I was becoming annoyed with these supposedly brilliant young minds who were self absorbed and not particularly likeable. Getting high, getting drunk and smoking endless cigarettes was apparently their way of coping with anything that disrupted their lives. Oh, and by the way, aliens are on their way to destroy us. I won't be rushing to watch the second series. Possibly this is yet another case of stretching a story into multiple episodes when tight writing and less screen hours might have resulted in a superior and more enthralling series.
0	If you haven't watched it already, prepare to be blown away, and then sorely disappointed. The last season ruins what was one of the best fantasy adaptations to date. I'm not even a Martin fan, but was unable to deny the quality of the production and the outstanding work of the cast. Fantastic acting. But man did the writers disappoint with the conclusion.
2	I often find it difficult to remain engaged in a TV series. Most I put down after watching either the first few episodes or sometimes even just the first episode.That wasn't the case here. I played the games, and decided to watch with family that hadn't. And it had a bit of everything. You were always wondering what was going to happen next. It was weird - in a good way. Even for someone like me in having played the games before, they throw in new storylines and ways of setting the scene that capture what makes Fallout Fallout in its own unique way.Highlight was the music - both the composed pieces and licenced songs. Seriously there is nothing quite like this series. Do give it a chance.
0	I feel like the show would've been 10x better if they'd removed the Lucy storyline and just followed the Ghoul. Her story added nothing and was just plain irritating. It was filled with plot holes, too.The show missed the entire vibe of Fallout and changed lore because they wanted to fit things neatly into their story. Everything felt forced, like they needed to cram as much in as possible.If you aren't a Fallout fan, maybe you'd like it? But if you are a fan, this just doesn't work. It felt like a really bad fan fic. I'm disappointed; I was really hoping that there would be a whole series we could enjoy in between games. I don't think I could make it through another episode.The show should've chosen a direction and a story and stuck with it instead of being all over the place. Just a mess.
0	What's incredible? The large number of positive reviews. Having watched the whole series I can't see why so many have seen merit in this show. I am suspicious that some at least may not be genuine.The main characters are unconvincing. It is impossible to believe that Donny could lurch so often between extremes of success/elation and despair.I guess the explanation of this is that he and his tormentor are both severely disturbed. But I found it really tiresome.Does it have any merits? I suppose there is some value if it succeeds in directing other abuse sufferers to sources of help and advice. But I think most people don't watch Netflix to see public information films. I certainly don't. I'm looking for good drama and this wasn't.
2	Greys Anatomy is hands down my favorite show even though Shonda Rhimes killed out everyone that i loved. Greys is definitely a good show to binge watch on Netflix. It is a heart breaker for sure. i don't think i have ever cried so much. i never thought i would like this show because i am not big on blood and ER scenes but i still got addicted. Greys isn't just ER and surgery's its romance and comedy and death and love. its happiness. my favorite couple would have to be Jackson and April besides grey and mcdreamy. there is not really a character that i hate. you just grow on all of them. if you watch this i recommend private practice as well
1	Let me say right off the bat that I'm not a fan of the video game series and only partially know about it. Watching this series, I was learning about the universe from scratch. And I liked something, but mostly not.I want to note the good visuals. A lot of different visual details related to the universe. Music and atmosphere in the spirit of the game. Good acting. And... that's it.I found the first episode terrible in so many ways, namely: the dialogs are strange, it looks dragged out, it's done well enough at the same time, but also with amateurish moments; the performances are clumsy, the soundtrack in some places didn't like, there are illogical moments of the script, and most importantly - the world doesn't seem natural. I can't believe in this world given the fantasy of what's going on until the very end of season 1, although it became more interesting to watch as the plot progressed. Sure, the script is pretty okay at some points, but for the most part it doesn't shine with reason. The graphics towards the end of season 1 are of lesser quality than in the beginning. To me, as a person completely unfamiliar with the universe, hyperbolizing, not explained from the first series about this world and how everything is arranged in detail. Having watched 1 season to the end, I'm sure that I don't understand all the things in the universe.The series is extremely overrated by video game fans, in my opinion. I don't see why the series has an 8.6 except for the visuals matching the universe, characters, music, and atmosphere. The authors tried to recreate the universe, and judging by the fans they succeeded, but the script of the series itself brings it down to the level of mediocre series, destroying the interest in such a story.
0	"The show would have been better if they killed off Meredith in the plane crash and have Lexi stay to have a ""Grey"" in the show. Pompeo was fine at the beginning but just became a arrogant witch who would just go out and get drunk and complain a lot. I would only watch the shows mass injury shows."
1	"I mean what genre are shows like The Boys or Santa Clarita. They aren't Black comedy but there's definitly a comedic thread here. I tried to stick through the pilot episode but it was hard. When it was over, I felt relieved.I'm not a gamer - although I did rescue the princess once in the early 90s. My only familiarity with the game Fallout is what I researched before writing this review. So I won't fit in to the 95% category of reviews here. But most sites describe it as anti Capitalist - which is ironic since here in the present we're the closest we've ever been to a nuclear war. But this series starts in the 1950s, like the game, where people were truly afraid of nuclear war. It was a different political climate, to say the least.From a purely entertainment perspective, this show has not captured my intrigue - at all. The war theme is up my ally but it's just all in the background so far - a glimpse at the helos; some bad mf in iron suits standing by like man servants; a trans ""brother"" referred to as ""their"". The bloodshed in pod 33 bordered on comical aided by the lois lane dumdum who suddenly knows how to handle a dart gun and survives by luck.Speaking of Lucy, she gets a knife in her abdomen where the blade is vertical but when she goes to staple the wound, it's now horizontal. Is this sloppy production or part of the comedy? I mean, it's so blaring, I'm honestly stumped.Although I'm not fond of the character, I can appreciate the determination and sheltered but diciplined mentality. I'm hoping she becomes a badarse. (Also just kind of glad we're past the whole leading lady must be Hispanic thing.)The pilot is presented in 4 sections to intro the various groups of characters, which I think was a poor decision. Traditionally, a pilot grabs your interest by investing in a handful of characters. It would have intrigued me more to have shorter glimpses with more focus on one group or other. Instead, it uses kind of a speed-dating technique. No one likes those.The pilot had an opportunity to focus on Maximus but his interesting dialog comes after an oddly long pause just in time to almost make the 5 min scene have some value. Until then he seems pretty superficial. But I can tell he's going to be an ingesting character.To summarize: too slow pace; too much comedic underpinning; boring sountrack; immature gore style.I don't think I'll be watching more but I thought that about Wheel of Time, too, then it hooked me - The 1st season (2nd Season not recommended). Is GoreCom a category?"
1	This show started with a bang and kept all its promises for 4 seasons. Complex plot with amazing characters, dialogs with deep meaning and consequences, good cinematography and great writing. Season 5 and 6 were made after they ran out of source material and it shows a bit. Some episodes are outstanding however, and it makes out for some weaker plot lines. Season 7 and 8 are harder to watch as characters start to betray their own arcs. Dialogs are weak and the main plots don't make sense anymore. The cinematography is still great but the writing is getting worse and worse and the story feels rushed. The plot armor that was almost non existent in the beginning gets thicker and thicker. It's hard to watch such a great show end like this.In short, it is a great ride, but the landing is hard and messy.
0	Season 3 has been touched by progressive ideology so is nothing more than a piece of junk.
0	The premise of this show is about a man reliving his real life experiences of being stalked, and for the 3 three episodes it was exactly that. It was interesting seeing all the mad things this stalker did who was player very well by Jessica Gunning.From the 4th Episode on it went downhill quickly. The show just became about Richard Gadd's sexual experiences and all the mad things that had happened to him along with all the self pity you could fit into a mini series. It became boring and the stalker was hardly in it and in all honesty felt like a different show.By the end I couldn't even believe a lot of what happens was true, he's changed his name for the character which is suppose to be himself (like why?), won't say anything e.g. Reveal the identity of his stalker and just in general much of the story doesn't make sense at times.After starting well I wouldn't reccomend watching this unless you enjoy hearing about other peoples sexual experiences and all the self pity that comes with it.
0	i'm writing this review after being a faithful fan for almost 6 years or probably more, the early seasons were awesome, then starting from the 7th Shanda rimes creativity started to turn into craziness, the 8th was a disappointment, all the stories were diluted and Shanda seemed indecisive whether to continue them or break them, the end of the 8th season was the most disturbing and stupid finale ever... the series seems to be written by an amateur, she crushed the spirit and the awesomeness of this series.....what a catastrophe, never let your creativity go out of track and destroy your creation !!!
1	Easy reviews first, the visuals are mostly bad, special mention to the chimp. The sound design is mostly good. Lighting is pretty standard and Netflixy but works.Not for more in-depth commentary. Actors are alright but mashing all characters into 6 or 7 main ones is pretty weird, when you think about it and the coincidences that occur. The characters they introduced like Tatiana are not well written. Jack Rooney is alright I guess.I liked Will and Jyn, but them being Yun Tianming and Cheng Xin feels rushed. Same with Saul being Luo Ji or Wade being born in the 20th century. I understand the need for introducing us to important characters early, but I dislike how they did this. Things happen so quickly that it becomes boring. Not once are the protagonist struggling with coming up with a solution. For example, Staircase? Dealt with in 5 minutes of screen time.Also, Augustina is one of the worst characters ever created. They tried making her this cold and cool clever girl while still having her being unstable and honestly pretty stupid in her relationships. Makes no sense.So yeah honestly I'm glad that's not my first introduction to this universe.
0	I loved Game of Thrones up until season 8. The detailed story telling died before Cersei and Daenerys. This was very lackluster and disappointing.
2	Shogun i a great show. I really liked the authenticity of the characters speaking Japanese, which significantly heightens immersion. However, the experience could be further enriched if conversations in various European languages were portrayed in their native tongues rather than solely in English. It feels somewhat incongruous when characters reference speaking Portuguese, for instance, yet converse in English. Similarly, the discrepancy is noticeable when Dutch sailors communicate in English aboard their merchant vessel. This inconsistency stands out, especially when contrasted with the meticulousness of the Japanese content.Despite only viewing a few episodes, the portrayal of scenes and the performances of the cast lend credibility to the narrative. The attention to detail in set design and costume, coupled with convincing performances, creates an immersive viewing experience. The characters feel authentic, and their interactions contribute to the overall believability of the story. Each scene unfolds with a sense of realism, drawing the audience deeper into the world of feudal Japan.
1	From the start of the show there was some silly or goofy bad decisions.Such as putting blue contacts in the eyes of the actor that plays John Blackthorn. It makes him look like an alien or mermaid.I don't know if it's the actor or the directing but John Blackthorn is portrayed at a big goof. They made John into a fumbling fool. He is similar to Kelso from That 70s Show.This seems to be a story about one man's good luck. Actually it's more like great luck that never runs out.John Blackthorn doesn't earn anything. It seems as if this Mr Magoo like character stumbles into good fortune no matter how much he messes up.
1	The first two seasons of The Rookie were probably among the best bits of televisison content I have seen in a while. Very fun, entertaining and enjoyable. The only issue I have had from the beginning is that the rookies participate in high risk situations from the very start. I find that bothering as it seems not very realistic. Overall I would still easily give S1-2 an 8 star rating.With Season 3 the series started to decline. Too much drama, too many high risk missions, officers with little experience participating in SWAT raids and undercover missions and even going on an unsanctioned mission abroad. I find that all to be a bit too much.This continued for S4 and S5 with the latter having very weak stories and character developement, leaning too heavily on action and seamingly tragic events. The season finales in particular are dissapointing as they continue to descent into unrealistic storytelling.As of March 24, I have high hopes for S6 which so far is looking good.Overall, I rate this series 7/10 as it does not uphold the quality of the first two seasons but 6/10 seems a bit harsh since it is still somewhat binge-worthy even in the later seasons.
1	When this show first started I used to watch I religiously. Oh, how I longed for new episodes and new seasons! I loved every character, each one had their own history and the writers made sure of well enough character development. And - of course - the medical drama was top notch, obviously a bit unrealistic at times while still holding up the dramatic value it had for the storyline.Whenever a main character died (and oh boy, did they die...), I was crying in front of my tv because I was so invested in this show.However... I had to stop watching after the plane crash in season 7 (? I don't even remember which season it was). At this point, it all felt way too unrealistic to be enjoyable anymore. Up until that season, the main characters had to endure so many traumatic life experiences that you would guess they would never set foot in that hospital ever again. The writers killed off main characters or important side characters, they let main characters have terrible diseases, near-death experiences, accidents, miscarriages... and the list goes on. It's honestly ridiculous and laughable.Used to be my favorite show of all time, now I can only assume it's a big piece of dreadful mess.
2	Amazing how different the reviews are. Goes to show that it´s all in the eye of the beholder. If a show is 100% 1:1 on the basis material, why not just stick to the book? The characters in there are eminent beyond any adaptation, as they are your own creations. It is the magic stuff that cannot be replaced by any TV show or movie. So in reality, the ones reviewing based on truthfulness toward the books are pointing to something no-one can ever see; their own personal inner show. So far, the production is top notch, the actors doing a marvelous job and the whole tension build-up of the show feels very well made.
1	The background rock music makes dialogue difficult to understand.Probably just give up on this one.
1	First off I did not read the books or watch the previous series and I a at episode 7 at the moment, I love Hiroyuki Sanada, even from the trailes the scenery and cinematography seemed amazing, and then having over 9 stars in IMDB starting off, everything seemed promising, and you can tell there was a lot of care put into the show a lot of the details are very impressive and the violent scenes are very realistic and impacting for sure that was all well setup in the first episode, and I understand why a lot of the fans of the old Japanese culture would love this, I like it but I am no fan compared to these people, but after episode 7 I confirmed my worst fear, the writing got lazy and dumb.First of all I want to talk about the blackthorne actor, I really think he was a mistake, probably the worst one of the show, his voice is amazing but he should stick with voice acting, every scene he is on feels like an amateur trying to impress his dad, all his gestures, face expressions and movements are just a pain to watch not to mention he looks like a 14 year old on a giant body, he just looks too innocent to be the character he is trying to be and whats worse does some things that I think were meant to be badass but it just ended up looking ridiculous, stealing the light on all the other great elements of this show, not to mentio his character arc makes no sense, he kinda grows, but then he doesn't and goes back to being a primitive ape trying to seem ballsyAnd now as for the writing, the last straw for me was (SPOILER ALERT) a certain someone slipping to his death, is it supposed to be shocking? I guess it was, but probably on an unintended way, hell it was even funny to some degree but with things like these it's hard to take this show seriously and I really feel for those who did their best job to make this series great, their work is overshadowed primarily by Blackthorne and some of the writing confusing decisions, and this is coming from someone who is entirely new to this story, no books or previous TV series knowledge at all, but I hear they are making some dumb changes to the book and I think it is true.I am kinda hoping that these last few episodes and the seemingly dumb writing pays off in some way I am not able to understand yet, but right now that hope does not seem something worth holding on to. I am probably going to finish it anyway, it's not like it is too bad that it is intolerable either, but it is definitely overrated, I'd give it a 7.5, but I'm going with 6 simply because it does not deserve to be over 9 at this moment, I'd let an 8 pass, maybe even 8.5 knowing the strong wave of Japanese culture fans all over the world that would be blind to the negative aspects of the show, but 9 it's just an insult to other series that do deserve it. Feels like a ghost of Tsushima thing all over again, I also wanted to like it only to find out it was just a prettier assasin's creed with slightly better gameplay but it was nowhere near the masterpiece people seemed to think it was, even as far as believing it deserved game of the year over The Last of Us Part 2, just cuz they were not mature enough to appreciate a great story.
0	"Nathan Fillion as a rookie ???? .. Come on guys be realistic ... He is 50 ... It is his time to put in his retirement paper and live on Pension. :) This is the worst possible casting ever ... he already looks old and tired in Castle""... It is a big disadvantage that the stories are aint good in this series.. Very poor show !! I suggest skip this one and watch old rerun of castle for the lovely Stana Catic"
1	I have read all 3 books, the three-body problem, the dark forest and the immortal death. A trilogy worthy of the great literary works of science fiction (and I have read some) I saw the Chinese version television series (30 episodes) an excellent plot with a lot of scientific explanation. The characters are very endearing.I listened to Chinese music (WOW) a true masterpiece.Same creator did like with the end of Game of Thrones... :( Ok for the special effects which are better but cut too much from the story, not easy to follow for anyone who hasn't read the books.As for the music of Ramin Djawadi how not to be disappointed after what he had created in GOT.
0	Andrew Scott is an incredible actor, yet this film somehow doesn't sit right with me. The visuals are over-the-top and distract from the main story. The protagonist's lack of expressiveness makes him difficult to read, unlike Matt Damon's version which still managed to capture his humanity despite his flaws. Some might argue that the cold unpredictability in Andrew Scott's version offers a fresh perspective on the classic sociopath trope, but the lack of overall chemistry between the characters makes this remake altogether unimpressive. Perhaps if I hadn't seen the Matt Damon version, I'd have appreciated this more in its own right as an Art House-y modern film noir type.
0	"As soon I saw that they destroyed NCR in 2277 when Battle of Hoover Dam took place in New Vegas, I realized that Bethesda doesn't like spotlight which Obsidian got and Has with classic Fallout and New Vegas. Also, Vault Tec being responsible for war and nuking is just lazy writing and not showing respect towards franchise.This show is made for people who never played nothing beyond Fallout 3 and 4 and for general audience which wants ""cool"" post apocalyptic show.Fallout was always about post-post-apocalypse and not about post-apoclypse.Bethesda, sell your IP to someone who has more heart in doing it."
0	And that is the problem.I relay liked the book and the 1984 version. It was true to the book and the development of the characters was great.This time there is no development. Only spectacle.Where is the attempted suicide of Blacktorh. It's a pivot moment in the story. Because of that I whould never try to blackmail Marico into not committing sepuku, because he understood the need.There is almost nothing done with the crew anymore. In the book it is clear that blacktorn is getting more ja[panese and the crew not. Important for the development.Why should blackthorn leave toranaga. Makes no sense and it is not explained.Why the side line with his son trying to kill toranaga's brother. That makes no sense.The attack with the guns is laughable. No way the guns in that period could shoot that accurate.Even the cloth blacktorn is wearing. I can not imagine that a hatamoto whould wear them. Much to shaby.Why not have the portugese speak portugese, the dutch dutch etc.The screen writer did not understand the book and the subtile weaving of the plot.If you did not see the 1984 version or read the book, it's nice entertainment, but nothing more.
1	"This is a very uneven show. Some parts are thrilling and compelling... some meander and don't make sense. Some casting is spot on while some irritated me the entire time. I can't say I would be excited about a season 2. I never read the book but the show centers on 5 or 6 smart ""scientists"" dealing with the aftermath of a collapse of science. The main character Auggie -- a scientist who is supposed to be starting a nanotech company. Too bad she looks like a 23 year old supermodel who I don't buy as a scientist for a second. There is also some of the famous D&D poor writing with a dumbing down of the story as you can see they only allude to complicated subjects but never go into them. Then there is the idea that just about everything in the world just happens to happen to this 5 or 6 person friend group in London. Not buying it. There is also a plot line that goes over 6 or so of the episodes that, in the end, comes to nothing. Super uneven. There is just honestly no one to root for in this story even with actors doing their level best."
0	It had a lot of fillers, too much time wasting moments and for 60 minutes runtime that's a disappointment.I thought it would have more to it honestly!Reunions are great but enough Hollywood BS and let's get back the real GOT moments.I really hope the rest of the show isn't a bummer.Not sure how they'll fit in the rest in 5 more episodes.6/10 and that's being kind
1	I haven't read the books. I watched the show as is and although it had a compelling back story, it just got incredible draggy & boring. Nothing compelling. Can't relate with any of the characters. The 'emotional' or 'uplifting' scenes lacks zero punch.You can definitely watch it but you'll definitely find yourself being bored to death several times during several episodes.Yes I'd like to know where the story goes but honestly, zero interest to. If there's nothing else to watch, might give season 2 a watch.I love philosophy. I love physics. And this isn't boring because if these 2 topics. It's the lack of connection with the characters and the episodes literally being draggy af.
2	I was 10/10 on this, got very into the series initially and was thinking of it a lot, always looking forward to that next episode. Very well directed and written, the camera effect was sometimes not to my liking but gave a unique style so that didnt bother me too much. However, I found the ending to be somewhat anti-climatic, the 9th episode was amazing and kinda feels like the last episode was some weird epilogue. Also the first half of the series had a great build up, then it started feeling like nothing was gonna happen. And nothing did happen.. sort off, action and war/battle wise. I dont need battles and sieges but it felt of after having that build up.. even in the intro showing war and sieges.
2	Overall the series deliver solid entertainment. I've read the books, watched the Chinese adaptation and did not expect the Netflix series to completely align with the book as the material is quite extensive. The books are one of the best in the sci-fi genre, I highly recommend reading them. The Netflix series manages to capture the essence of the books, however in a much watered down version. In my opinion a few more episodes could have been added to extend the storyline.I understand the reasoning behind the character changes which work fairly well in most cases and thus might appeal to a wider audience. Some of the actors are spot on, including Ye Wenjie, Da Shi, Jin Cheng and Thomas Wade. Unfortunately Auggie Salazar is totally off for me. She's supposed to be a top scientist but the over the top acting completely ruins the believability of the character. I could not relate to her at all and was impatiently waiting for her scenes to end. Too bad, as the rest of the cast works well together and delivers a smooth performance.The special effects are well done and enhance the storytelling which is big plus these days. The music was a bit of a letdown for me, nothing memorable here; in comparison, the Chinese adaptation has excellent music choices.I do recommend watching the series but don't expect it to be as scientifically engaging as the books.
1	I watched this show since the beginning. I still love it.Recently, last season (4) I find it hard to watch, because of the music in the background, it makes hearing dialogue more difficult.I don't know where this is going, but it's extremely annoying.Please listen to the people who watch the show and would like to continue to watch it.I love the script, the cast, overall the entire show, except loud, annoying and heavy music.Cheers.
0	I've not read the book and I've not watched the original mini series so I have no legacy investment. I watched this mainly because of the trailers and because of Hiroyuki Sanada's presence. First, the sub titles and English masquerading as Portuguese, if this is your problem then maybe you need to have a word with your inner racist. The sub titles aren't a problem it just means you have to watch and listen rather than being on your phone, as to English standing in for the Portuguese that would have been spoken, well good luck finding the audience that will endure subtitles for both Japanese and Portuguese speech. No, the real problem with this is the unfathomable plot strands and the central notion of a washed up English trader/pirate being important in a Japanese clan war. Non of the plot makes sense and the script is excruciating and no amount of bowing and being inscrutable can save it. A number of the players will be familiar to western audiences, the aforementioned Sanada has been in a lot of western productions, Anna Sawai & Takehiro Hira are both in Monarch, Legacy of Monsters, and Tadanobu Asano has a number of western productions under his belt, so this isn't amateur night. Unfortunately their lines don't help them deliver a coherent story and Cosmo Janis as the white saviour 'lead' further hampers things with a fairly uninspiring performance. Only two episodes have dropped so far but they were enough, I'm out.On an historical note, in 1600 Spain & Portugal were one kingdom ruled from Spain and the threat to their trade came from the Dutch (it wasn't called Holland!) not England.
0	This episode sucked hard! I sure as hell hope this isn't the future of this show. I don't need TV shows to TEACH me woke politics. I just want to watch a good show and be entertained. It is not fun to watch the hero of the show, Nolan and his fellow officers have their balls taken away from them by black citizens every 5 minutes. Then after being reprimanded they look like whipped puppies and cover their heads in shame for being white. This is divisive garbage intended to make white police officers feel ashamed and encourage black people to be thankless and feel victimized even when officers are offering them help. This episode just made me feel irritated because it seemed to be anti-cop while at the same time being a cop show. Asinine.
2	"Seasons 1 & 2 were very entertaining and kept me coming back for more. Season 3...did they change writers???? Sooo much ""woke"" culture crap being focused on, stop it!"
0	"The show definitely has style. I am not talking just about the black-n-white film, which some may consider to be enough to call a media ""art house"". Camera work, decorations and costumes. They seem to present the era nicely and give this... ""Vibe"", I guess. It somehow feels realistic, even though it probably is not, if you look closer.Unfortunately, for me, that's all there is. I did not get a connection with any of the characters showed in the first episode, and for the most part I was wondering ""what is this show really about?"". I get it, that it's a slow-burn, that does work in some shows and movies, but I am not sure it works here, especially, since the show is about a conman.I am not saying it should be running at a much higher pace, essentially turning into a short movie, no. But there are just so many shots, that do not enrich the story in any way, let alone move it forward. They look amazing, yes, but from narrative perspective they are mostly pointless."
0	"Someone else in here characterized it well already, they try way too hard. Way too hard for this to be received as anything of substance. Ripley alone as a character study might have worked, but then when the interactions start to pick up in the plot, you realize that this is a piece created by try hards for people selfidentifying as ""cultured"" who just have to sing the praises of a work, because its black and white (which nowadays is not less expensive to film). And tonedeath.As soon as the dialogue delivery starts between the characters, everything is off. Every glance lasts for the usual 5 seconds after it has seized becoming a glance. Every telegraphed ""you are not welcome here"" gets the extra 15 headnods while the actor really sells the delivery and sells it, and sells it, and sells it - and keeps selling it. Even the self recognition, of ok, you know that I cant paint, but you are being polite somehow manages to come in just minutes after its appropriate delivery time... Its not like the actors are bad essentially, but like they were told to ""hold that emotion"" so the typical Netflix customer has a chance to ""catch the emotion on that face"".At that point all of the deliveries seize to be mediocre and just venture full into bad, which is then underlined by atmosphere heavy scenes, of listening to some chanteuse in a bar where the focus is on capturing her face and everyone being captured by their self indulgent righteousness of experiencing that picturesque moment of consuming an espresso in that venue - but no one cared enough not to hire the directors girlfriend for the singing part.Sure, if you are the target audience of this, which has to be the tonedeath, asocial beings that Gen-Z are often mischaracterized as today, I guess you love this for all the gravitas it comes with -- but if you are anyone that isnt a self indulgent art lover to the maximum, its hard to see yourself putting up with this neurotic, depressing version of Ripley for more than the appropriate one and a half minutes while your ogling the god darn exit to get out of that social interaction.This is not a display of a sadly all too likeable psychopath - this is the little wished to be on Apple TV show that fulfills the wish of half of their audience, to at least for once in their life, be able to read an emotion off of someones face - while giving them the impression that ""asocial"" is the totally new social and accepted, and ""no you are perfectly fine in this interaction"" if you just take that trip to italy to meet your dream upperclass prince, that always waited for you and you always wanted to have a seemingly meaningful conversation with...I'll revisit this review, once I've finished watching the series, but just getting through the next scene has become a chore here...And yet I'm absolutely sure that the mediocraty in filmlovers will love this - because it made them feel some emotions in every scene! Drab, dreary, idiotic, delivery with no timing - but for sure, some emotion will be plastered on every actors face for 12 seconds at least, just so you could catch up with that.Talented? Who needs to be talented these days?"
1	The adaptation of the universe in which it takes place is close to perfect! The locations are spot on and it definitely feels like fallout. The main characters are mostly great, with a few exceptions, and the story is ok. All in all it feels like the show finds it pace and the characters feels settled in the last couple of episodes. It bodes great for the second season!There are however a few things that don't sit right with me, the major thing being the ghouls in the games have always been explained by radiation, but in the show people are made into ghouls by a some concoction.All in all a good show worth seeing even if you've never played the games!
1	This guy seems very confused, both in the show and in real life. He talks about being groomed, yet isn't even aware of the definition of grooming and how it has to involve a minor. It's a huge insult to abuse victims everywhere. On top of that, attempting to make a stalker sympathetic is a horrible choice. It's not their fault? They're simply mentally ill? I've got news for you, being mentally ill doesn't make you sympathetic or a victim in and of itself, especially if it involves a personality disorder you can't treat, or the fact that medicating a person doesn't change who they are aside from tiring them out. Most people don't make the poor choices that lead them to being stalked as in this case where he basically insinuates that some people bring it on themselves. Well, he certainly did! He absolutely should be embarrassed by his life choices which are now insulting women and men alike by assuming his experiences in any way relate to others. This show isn't progressive, it's regressive. It has you nearly constantly cringing at the bad humor, intense and triggering scenes, and poorly worded narration excusing most of the behaviors. The actress playing Martha is so convincing, she's the only reason to keep watching. At least the show draws a better conclusion than the main character's real life story.
1	Well the first couple of seasons where good! Game of Thrones has magic, dragons, action, and drama; with a hard does of x rated scenes and nudity. Game of Thrones has H B O movie quality, sets, and A list actors. Game of Thrones follows a good mix with some of England's history which give a real feel for the major story line mixed in with magically fantasy. (ie the wall the Romans built around Scotland) Like The Sopranos H B O made a fresh, cutting edge, and raw series. Regrettably the later years of the series becomes formulated, redundant, and hemmed in; much like the Walking Dead series. Does anyone watch the Walking Dead anymore? Well the killing off of lead characters, and introduction of new characters creates new life for a series. Regrettable the second half of Game of Thrones loses steam like most series. 7 out of 10 stars.
2	This show was a lot of fun to watch when the original cast were there, but as the seasons went on, and character after character were killed off, it lost its charm. Few of the newer cast are interesting to watch, with the exception of Amelia, whose neurotic behavior is just hilarious when you consider she's a neurosurgeon... When they killed off everyone in Meredith's family, there just wasn't enough to keep me watching. Lexie was the last straw!
2	I'm sure everyone has heard about Shogun by now but if you haven't, what are you waiting for? It's basically Game of Thrones in feudal Japan but that description really sells it short. It's better than that.Instead of having a fantasy society to build, it delves into the real society of feudal Japan, with its own set of stringent rules that sometimes can seem alien and incomprehensible to the single European in the story who is a major character, John Blackthorne.Blackthorne starts as a churlish pirate/sailor (though he disputes being a pirate) and over the course of the season, evolves tremendous growth. The other major characters have amazing journeys of their own: Toranaga, a descendant of ancient Shoguns, who is suspected by others in the samurai class of wanting to revive that title; and Lady Mariko, a steely, intelligent and elegant interpreter for Blackthorne.Don't be put off by the fact that the dialogue is almost all subtitled Japanese. You get used to it quickly.Supposedly this is a miniseries but I don't believe it. It's too popular and where the story ends feels like a prelude to a bigger story.
1	Just becomes kinda boringThe black & white photography is intense and spectacular. The setting is moody and gothicBut it soon becomes plodding and drab. There is no dramatic tension.Andrew Scott is fascinating, but too obviously psychopathic, the spectre of Moriarty looms over him, so there is little surprise where his character is headedFlynn is lacking any charisma. Fanning is distant. No characters drew me in.For me, it is severely lacking against the 'Talented Mr Ripley' movie. Matt Damon was twitchy, envious and desperate. Scott just seems robotic.Got to episode 4. I will stick with it, but I feel it will be a slog.
0	Trust me. Its just a painful unwatchable mess. There are a few high points- especially storylines around Shawn Ashmore's character. But overall, its not worth watching. If you want something great to watch, try Longmire.
2	If you haven't seen the show start watching it right now because the early seasons are absolute gold it's the best show ever!! I'm only rating on what I have seen of Greys Anatomy which is seasons 1-8 + episode 1,2,3 of Season 9 and episode 21 season 11. I am only rating these sections of Greys Anatomy because after episode 4 of season 9 I stopped watching because the show had dropped off big time with quality which is why I don't watch it anymore. After the significant death that occurs at the beginning of season 9 that was my tipping point I couldn't watch it anymore - let's just say it was one of my favourite characters. That was the last straw for me. Now I just rewatch the show up to season 9 because it's soooo good!! Do yourself a favour and watch it - just don't go past the early eps of season 9 because you'll be disappointed.
1	Game of thrones seasons 1-4 is probably some of, if not THE absolute best television i have ever seen. BUT When only half the show is great i cant give it a 9- or 10/10. Season 5 truly is a mediocre season. Probably a 7 or 8 out of 10. Perhaps a 6,5 in some areas. Then we get to season 6. Season six is without a doubt the most controversial season of the show overall. In my opinion, 70% of it is meh, 20% trash, and 10% best television ever made. I dont really like season six, but i dont hate it either. There was just some decisions made during production that makes No sense from neither a storytelling or a character perspective.Now. The Meat and potatoes. Season 7 is absolutely horrendous. No, i do not want to listen to People that say that 8 is the only terrible season from a writing standpoint. Its not. They both suck ass. The only reasons that 8 is worse is because 1: Its the finale and it sucked. 2: People were getting their hopes up quite a lot for season 8 only to have Them shattered In a more obvious Way. Once you stop to Think, season 7 becomes almost as bad. People teleporting, characters being reduced to nothing.Season 8 is the same as season seven, only Its the final season so the argument could easily have been made that Its worse, but not only in the quality of writing. Every character that had not already been thrown out of the window in the span of season 5-7 gets thrown out the window in season 8. The only character that you could even Argue has a good and or satisfying conclusion is theon. And even his death was dumb. The man runs to his death instead of standing his Ground and at least trying to defend bran (the absolute disaster of a character) a little longer.If you need actual examples of the terrible nonsense that dumb and dumber calls writing, all you need to do is turn your brain on when watching season 8Sorry if i came of as agressive in the end. I just get so sad whenever i Think of What the show could have been, had They stuck to the books.
2	I am certain in these reviews someone is moaning about the lack of realism but who cares. The show is eminently watchable, if you want realism join the force, it's 98% boring. The show is entertaining. Our old friend Nathan always brings a sense of humor to the roles he plays. The first episode of the second season starts with a bang but I do miss Afton Williamson as Bishop. She was my favorite of the three training officers. I know she had some problem but I hope she finds a new role somewhere. If you enjoyed the first season you will enjoy this one.
1	While it starts off excellent and full of potential it quickly loses steam due to some lazy derivative writing would recommend it but there are better fantasy alternatives out there However I'll compliment the great acting and production values
2	Game of Thrones boasts an intricate plot with complex characters, stunning cinematography, and intense action sequences, especially its many battles and fights. It's hard to deny that it wasn't a cultural phenomenon that captivated me and many others for eight seasons.I've rated Game of Thrones a nine out of ten for its well-written and multi-layered storytelling, and its fantastic production value. However, despite still having amazing visuals and extremely high production value, like many fans, I was disappointed and to an extent frustrated by the final season's storytelling and how certain plot points were handled, which has lowered my rating from a ten to a nine. Despite this, Game of Thrones still remains for me a must-watch series and I would still highly recommend it to any fan of the fantasy or drama genre in general.
1	Loved the show up until it started to take more of a political standpoint between season 13 and 14. Started to take a liberal political stance. I just wanted to watch an entertaining show and I get nothing but nonsense pushed on me.
0	And this one sucks. The last two episodes ruined years of build up so badly that I can't find the words to describe it. I mourn for the years I invested in this show and hope that the books have a better ending.
0	"When it started, Game of Thrones was one of the most stunning and cinematic television series ever. The scope was breathtaking, the fights were exciting yet realistic, the characters were complex, the acting was great, and the writing was fantastic. It was one of the most shocking shows on television and you never knew who would die next! It was great.But then Season 8 happened.I'm willing to defend the first half of the season. Yes, even ""The Long Night"", as it was still breathtaking to watch despite the premature conclusion and dark lighting. However, the next episode cut corners and ultimately seemed too rushed. Even then, i had hope the series could return to its former glory.Ah, you poor, naïve child.Little did I know the last two episode weres not only rushed, but sacrificed almost a decades worth of character development, just for cheap shock value. It felt like an insult not just to me, but to all the fans who were on board with this show since day one, and even to loyal fans of the books series.And then the finale.I'm not going to even talk about it.It doesn't deserve words.GOT is dead, and I'll never be able to see it again.For those of you who have never seen it before, I warn you. Watch something else. Watch something like Breaking Bad, or The Sopranos, or Mad Men, or literally any other show in existence that has a better and more faithful conclusion than this one. Don't be like me.That is all."
1	Do you remember when you were told a bed time story? It started really well and you were so interested in all the characters. But then your mum or dad got bored when they saw you were getting a little bit sleepy. All of a sudden the story ended - they lived happily ever after (or they all died). I would have preferred to have fallen asleep rather than suffer through this disappointing end. (Stop at the end of season 7)
2	Depending on the taste of audience: G. O. T. = 50%eyes + 30%Brain + 20%HeartT. B. P. = 20%eyes + 50%Brian + 30%HeartOf course there are some obvious hiccups such as the blinking universe etc. The special effects could also be tremendously improved. Also the pace is a bit too fast for non book readers to fully comprehend the intriguing plots. However, as a 8-episode TV series it has achieved 90% of the goals brilliantly.To be fair, it's definitely not a fast food which can give you a sugar rush, but as long as you are patient enough and sit through the first 2 or 3 episodes, it opens a mind blowing world for you.Highly recommend regardless of your experience with the book!
0	1,353,000 deaths. And you make a comedy series. How victims and families would react when they see this work. War is destructive and devastating. It can cause immense suffering. The effects of war include long-term physical and psychological harm to children and adults, as well as reduction in material and human capital. War destroys communities and families and often disrupts the development of the social and economic fabric of nations.involves intimate violence, including witnessing death through direct combat, viewing the enemy before or after killing them, and watching friends and comrades die.
0	"Grey's starting getting more political than I liked, but I was done after they compared the riots we've seen to MLK marches. Anyone with a brain can google MLK quotes, and you'll know they're not the same thing at all. Even Malcom X would be ashamed as he warned of the dangers of a white liberal.Grey's would have been much better off if they focused on developing the characters and stories instead of the tired ""let's kill Meredith and bring her back"" and pushing their personal politics...ESPECIALLY if they can't even push them accurately. You can talk about issues and tell the stories of those who have gone through them without making it feel like you're watching the reeducation camp collection that focuses on brainwashing instead of actually making it good. I watch fiction tv to escape the news, not to be beaten over the head with inaccuracies and someone else's politics. I'd never have changed it from the news if that's what I wanted."
2	This is the first series i would recommend to anybody , it is an amazing piece of work , the most stunning TV series you will ever watch. Why i gave it 9/10 because of the last season, it's still good but very disappointing compared to all the seasons. YOU will enjoy every episode
0	Baby Reindeer is billed as a darkly comic thriller about a man dealing with a stalker. In reality, it's a show about a man who just cannot get out of his own way. The main character is constitutionally incapable of making good decisions, or even neutral ones. Exhibit A: In episode 1, he meets a woman who is, from the word 'Go' quite clearly a quivering mass of psychological red flags teetering on the brink of madness. He then discovers that she's a compulsive liar who served four years in prison for stalking, beating up an old woman, more stalking, making false reports to child services, and, oh yeah, even more stalking. Ask yourself, what would a normal person do when confronted with that information? If you answered 'Friend the stalker on Facebook', you and the main character would probably get on famously. In fact, you'd probably end up stalking each other.This is a show about a man who spends about six months repeatedly sledgehammering himself in the nuts and then complaining that his nuts hurt. If that's your cup of tea, I hope you enjoy it. Unfortunately, it wasn't mine, so I didn't.
1	"Created by Geneva Roberts and Graham Wagner for Amazon Prime, we follow Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), an underground vault dweller hundreds of years after nuclear war has destroyed most the surface of the globe. A story familiar for fans of the games, Lucy must adventure to the surface to rescue her father and discover what kind of civilization is left intact in the irradiated, monster-ridden world above. As a show there are considerable shortcomings, but ultimately quite a good time. A franchise based around heavy world building the show hits the ground running introducing us to the lore and the backstory, through the lens of 4 or so characters in places and times. Again for those already familiar with the games this rapid catch-up may seem fine, however a series introduction the opening is considerably blocky, with strange pacing, and frankly weird dialogue. As someone who has played much of the games, there's a lot to be said on the production choices around which were to give that ""video game"" feel, however I don't like many of those choices, personally. Characters only interacts as if its a Bethesda engine, lots of standing and talking, sitting and talking, or walking and talking. Characters never have business, or things to practically do, in scenes. And the opposite, during any scenes of movement or action montages we get basically zero dialogue, sometimes for minutes at a time. If really does feel like watching a video game at points, in a subtle way the bad first-person scenes in the new Halo adaptation didn't even capture. However these choices may certainly appeal to some and they certainly seem to, totally fair. There are also tons of references to things across all the games, which was neat, although ascetically its of course continuing into the heavier saturation, Todd Howard version of the Fallout universe, most prominent now in the styles of the games 76 and Shelter, which again of course makes sense as he serves as a producer. Some practical props were hit and miss, as was the CGI. Things in scenes and backgrounds tended to look great, however hero props the characters actually held were often very cardboard / rubber looking. And I don't wanna talk about the de-aging CGI. Narratively as we progress the series improves although as story twist after story twist comes, especially towards the end, I didn't mind them, they just rarely felt justified by what lead up to it. That said the set pieces and wardrobe are all great, I was extremely impressed. Acting is all suitable, Purnell as Lucy was good, I of course loved Walton Goggins' performance. Ultimately a pretty fun story that does eventually come together once it gets going, although I expect may be a bit confusing or lacking for those completely unfamiliar with the lore from the games. I liked it, didn't love it, but will definitely check out the next season whenever that comes."
1	"Initially, I was preparing for complete failure (today this is the default state). But in anticipation of bad things, surprisingly nothing bad happened. Quite a normal plot (even classic regarding the ""main plot action""). There is no absurd break in the narrative, no strong pull on topics that we would not like to see. Walton Goggins works at 476% and pleases the eyes.A pleasant abundance of fan service, music, costumes, merch and more things like this (sometimes its just looks too ""clean"" for this world and the feeling that they were filming with what they could dig up on ali or ebay for 500 bottle caps)The biggest disadvantage is that there is no atmosphere of a post-apocalyptic world and a series of games, there is almost no flair of the culture of America in the 60s. At least there isn't that hopelessness and decay of F1-2. Just regular modern people speaking about regular problems.The actors talk, looks and act like ordinary modern people drinking cappuccino in the center of New York 10 minutes ago. (except experienced ones like Goggins)In our modern world, you will probably find places that look worse and people who have more problems than in this world.Sometimes, against the backdrop of clean suits and regular acting, you will think that YouTubers have made high-quality fan fiction.The series is perfect for those who are not a big fan of realistic post-apocalyptic films, games and books, but loves the comedy of light absurdity. Who wants to look at the surroundings and a fresh perspective on this topic."
1	"I tried, i really tried to see it through (the whole show). But the amount of absurdity surrounding certain events pilled up beyond any form of common sense. The saying ""flogging/beating a dead horse"" was practically made for shows like Grey's Anatomy. This, coming from a long time fan of Grey's Anatomy and Shonda Rhimes (the way she phrased some lines - made it sound quite philosophical or even a modern spiritual teacher - if you will). That being said... I do believe she did a lot of good and touched a lot of hearts (mine included) - with her way of putting things into perspective. And i respect her for that. But... that's also why it's quite saddening and disappointing - to see a show i used to rate a solid 10/10 - trading quality for quantity to this extent. Can't give it more than a 7 in its current state - tho, even this ratting is mainly influenced by past content (it's higher for what it used to be). Anyway, episode 16 of season 16 - proved to be the final nail in the coffin for me.The show should be long dead - but some fans seem to find it hard to let it go (some say that's the only reason it's prolonged into continuous degradation)."
1	"I haven't read the book, but I eagerly awaited the series, so I did some research on the topic and learned about it before the series aired. Firstly, I must say that I found the acting weak. While Liam Cunningham's performance was good, the rest of the acting remained mediocre. The concept excited me, and the first two episodes were promising, but the pace gradually declined afterwards. Especially, the scenes of ""Will's love"" and ""Saul's Let's smoke concept"" exhausted me, so I fast-forwarded through those parts. Two or three episodes of the series were unnecessarily devoted to ""Will,"" which was a waste. Although I couldn't get enough of Eiza Gonzalez's beauty, I couldn't grasp the image of a nanotechnology genius character, which detached me from the reality within the series. Whenever I saw Eiza, I felt again like I was watching a TV show. I expected the season finale to be more thrilling. In short, I was saddened by the wasted potential of such a beautiful concept, but if you have spare time and enjoy science fiction, it's still worth watching."
2	I read the original novel this series is based upon. It is an awesome cultural journey of a Vietnamese man, who is half French. He is a double, triple agent, betrayed and abused by all sides but a man who is curiously resilient and talented. The cast is just great. This is not a Vietnam war story, it is an aftermath story. A brilliant telling of the Vietnam story by Vietnamese. The one great tragedy here is that the original novel has the protagonist going from RVN to Franc, not America. America has almost no presence in the novel. So putting the story over in America is going to change the entire story arc, and this may not be a good thing. Really to bad the producers chose this route. At any rate this is an important story where we here from Vietnam, a story arc long overdue.
0	Liu Cixin's trilogy is as grandiose as Author C Clarke's books, the important element of hard core science fiction which expand over thousands years in history, is that it is focused on humantiy as a whole, not on individual or personal life, or private life. And a very important idea is normal people, even though they didn't know or meet each other, come together to the same goal, save humanity from alien invasion. However. And as humans are complicated, it is never about right or wrong, good or evil. However, netflix as its usual limited understanding, put the narrative as black or white, good or evil, binary thinking. And only english speaking people can save the world, a small circle of people who at exford, who know each other, alcohol, drug, f-words, psycholocal trouble, self-doubting, etc. Do people really put the future in these high school drama people's hands, seriously??? And there is a missing element from the original book, time distilled see things in a picture way, something that wasn't translated in English.
2	"It's a solid 9 as a show overall.However the last 2 seasons were rly rushed and way different than the previous seasons.We were used to a slow-medium pace back then.In the last 2 seasons apparently the writers thought it was a video game with fast travel.Characters would move all over Westeros rly fast.On the finale : Besides Danny going mad which was kinda hinted in the show, every other character was rly bad written with an ending that didn't do them justice.Also for me personally I would prefer if the ""game of thrones"" was first concluded and then the Long Night happen.The Long Night was supposed to be the biggest threat in the story even years before the events of game of thrones as we've seen in House Of the Dragon.I would rly like to see the night king marching down to kings landing and rly threatening all life in Westeros.It would serve as a suspense even in the end.For me this show needed 10 seasons with 10 episodes each at the pace we were used to in seasons 1-6. I guess if the writers didn't wanna finish it fast and all the books from George R R Martin were published things would be different.. Let's hope House Of The Dragon and further stories in the GoT world serve as redemption for this show."
2	"Definitely one of the finest creation of Netflix! The first 2 episodes puts the plot for the crime n the way it unfolds from third episode makes it one of the finest crime thriller ever to be remembered. A mind blowing thriller that leaves you hooked on completely. A limited series of 8 episodes n story ends in very first season n is based on 1955 crime novel, ""The talented Mr. Ripley"" and the story is set back in 1960. The monochromatic black n white execution n the background music completely complement each other. The acting, screenplay, mesmerising Italy n Rome places, landscapes, mind blending storyline everything makes it a masterpiece. Available in Hindi as well along with other foreign languages in Netflix. My ratings 9/10!"
0	"I am leaving a 1 star review as a moral obligation to lower this outrageously high rating.In truth, the show is a 6/10. It is watchable but it is not great like the current 9.1 rating suggests. I did not find myself in suspense at all for the next episodes to be released.The episodes often drag out and get boring due to long, often pointless, scenes. Yet, ironically the actual timeline of events moves at a lightning pace. The whole premise of the plot is centred around the question ""what is Toranaga planning"".Except what he is planning becomes increasingly unrealistic, drawn out, convoluted, and unnecessarily secretive to the audience."
0	They changed most of the setting to America. They butchered the most imprtant characters, and they either deleted them or split them into more characters, most of them american.They ignored 99% of the hard philosophical themes and questions.They ignored the hundreds of years gap. They invented dramas that do not exist, just for the sake of drama.They butchered the whole story. It is one of the worst adaptations I have ever seen. I gave it two stars and not one only because the movie Avatar The Last Airbender exists.If you are a fan of the book, do not watch this exercise of western arrogance.
0	The third season has transformed into something written to indoctrinate your 3rd grader. It's both insulting and dumb at the same time.Sad as the first couple of seasons were fairly good.
1	I love the look of this show. It's moody, it's dark, and while the landscape is not quite Japan, the Canadian wilderness is a decent analog. But looks can't carry everything, and the cracks are starting to show.The shogunate depicted is based less in history, but rather the obsession with a stoicism Western audiences associated with Japan during the early 20th century.The audience insert (notably British) is set up to see straight through this, and brings his enlightened views to the town he is gifted by Toranaga. It's a classic story as old as Hollywood, and it saddens me to see this trope rehashed time and time again.Perhaps it's that almost every Japanese character seems to be like some kind of cheesy anime character, either stoic, a buffoon, or a cackling villain. What little we see of the average worker is sweet or placid, a wallflower for Blackthorne to bounce off of in his classic rejection of stereotypical cultural tropes.I'm not asking for much, perhaps a little bit of insubordination. Because this period of time in history books was full of people breaking the mold in Japanese society. A mildly outspoken commoner, perhaps an unruly peasant. Just something to show that people were still people.Anyway, it's a nice looking show, and a little better than the days of movies like The Last Samurai. But it's got a long way to go, because the reliance on common stereotypes shows the lack of passion to depict people in a realistic and human way.
1	All those 10/10's is a joke by imbecils, practicly nothing is a 10 because that's perfect, and this is far from that.5/10 is generous and that mostly because it looks pretty good but not much more.The acting is okay but nothing special, particularly not by most of the main cast, specificly Blackthorne.The story and the characters are a mess, it is nothing like the original story and not in a good way.Important storylines skipped, changed or just messed up badly, characters acting out of character or even new plot lines added, stupid stuff and all of it stinks.I wouldn't recomend this to anyone but i guess it beats being stabbed in the eye.It's an affront to the original story, which was acctually good.
0	What was a decent (8 star) show went all PC and woke. Such a shame. This will be it's last season.
2	As a lover of the Ripley's stories (I have watched Delon's, Malkovich's and Damon's ) I cannot stop loving so far(I am in episode 2) the visual and thematic transformation that Zaillian has made of the Ripley's theme. It's radical to turn the Amalfi coast and Caravaggio into black and white. Also his creation of silence. I believe he wants to turn the characters too. Andrew Scott , always so sweet and likable, as the villain. Scarface Flyn (not sunnyface Jude Law) as Dickey who I am afraid Zaillian is urging us to dislike profoundly, starting with his highly bad taste in art. I wonder whether Zaillian wants us to accept Ripley's resolution.
0	D&D ruined what could have been the most epic and amazing TV series of all times. Watch only the 1-6 seasons, don't bother with season 7 and season 8.
0	**SPOILERS**This used to be my absolute favorite series. I would literally re-watch it once a year. At this point, I can barely even make it through an episode. It is SOOOO political and only talks about racism and LGTBQ and other crap nobody watches a fictional show to hear about, not to mention the ENTIRE season on COVID. They have killed off nearly all of the original characters and the new ones all suck! I ONLY watch the new episodes because I have since the begining and I have to see it through... but please Shonda Rhimes, just end it at this point. Ugh.
0	This show was on the top of my shows but season 8 rly ruined the whole Sefor me
0	This used to be a good show but what happened from season 3 onwards? I can only assume the original writers were all fired and replaced by a bunch of monkeys with typewriters. Please put it out if it's misery.
1	Overall it was a pretty solid show...until it went woke in season 3. Pushing political points at every turn. Still not a bad show but definitely a poor choice by the writers. After some major events in season 3, they seem to be floundering without much direction for the plot. They need to either get it together or wrap it up.Update: it has gone further downhill and totally lacks direction at this point. Watch seasons 1-2 then call it good. Everything else after is terrible.
0	It starts with a premise of an older guy joining the LAPD, then beats it to death with ageist jokes that would get the jokesters reprimands from HR. There is no plot each week, just a series of car chases, foot chases, and the insufferable know it all lesson of the week from the lead character, the old rookie played by Fillion, who has left acting for all intents and purposes and taken up playing himself with a range of expressions so limited he reuses the same ones for different emotions. Most of the other characters also have no depth or complexity and are uniformly played as stereotypes. The whole thing is bad and boring.
0	I'll start by pointing out what i like about this show; Good cinematography and acting. The rest is standard directing, mediocre soundtrack and a poor script.I've been in a situation many times, where a dialogue was going on and they spoke of other characters but i didn't seem to know who where they speaking of. I spent the entire first season trying to memorize the names of many of the characters (including some of the main ones). The second season actually made me memorize some of their names. Excluding the main characters the other characters are briefly introduced, nothing outlines them to make you remember which character is who. Do the script writers expect me to read the books before watching this?Worth mentioning that 90% of the show is dialogue, which is OK if it actually leads to something and it's a drama, instead of a fantasy series. Dialogue is mostly irrelevant and boring. It leads nowhere most of the time and does not contribute to the storyline. And in the rare moments it actually does, nothing happens next. You are hang with the promise of everything happening the next season. And to your disappointment, it doesn't. More dialogue and nothing happening. More promises...The story moves slowly. As if they had to stretch the whole thing to make every dollar of the budget count. Daenerys Targaryen could possibly be my favorite character, but she spends, up until now, 4 seasons to build an army and reach the iron throne (which i doubt it will only be in the 5th season, with some luck). That's how slow and boring this is.Whenever an episode finishes, i feel no urge to see the next one. There is nothing that lefts me hanging. I just feel like if they pulled the plug on this one it wouldn't make a difference to me.Mediocre show with dragons and special effects. People digest this crap because they are hungry for a fantasy series with a big budget. A well made Lord of The Rings style series. That's what viewers crave for. And this is the only reason people watch this and feel good about it. This show has no direct competition or it would be dead in the first season.Oh, and some advice. If you do actually watch this; you can take a leak, prepare your popcorn, grab a beer and call your friends to come over, all during the intro.
2	"I've read the books.I've also seen the Chinese adaptation.And I am intimately familiar with the physics. Which is to say, I know that, strictly speaking, the premise of the story is nonsense. But never mind that. There is a reason why ""fiction"" is part of science-fiction. It's okay for a fictitious universe to have fictitious rules governing its existence, so long as the author stays true to the story's premise. That is why I was able to enjoy the books, suspending my disbelief, and that is why I find this adaptation quite enjoyable as well.Make no mistake about it, the Chinese version was really good quality television, despite it having been, relatively mildly but still obviously, censored in places. But this Netflix version has its own strengths. Shorter (the Chinese adaptation was 30 episodes!) but I do not feel it rushed. I presently just finished watching episode 6, with two more to go. Eager to see the rest.I am, of course, well aware of the dark forest to which this story takes us, so no major surprises there. However, I find that I can relate to, care for the characters: I find them believable, genuine. And although some of the story has been transplanted from China to the West in this adaptation, the essence of the novel stays intact. I understand that the show had mixed reception.All the more, I remain hopeful that nonetheless, season 2 will be greenlit and we can see the rest of the story unfold, including I hope the third book of the trilogy, which had some of the most memorably twists yet."
0	Opening of episode one seems promising. Then, the Farrell tries to be stealth in his investigation. Surprise! He is driving a pristine early 60's Corvette convertible that sticks out like any proverbial sore appendage you want. He needs a 3000 Camry. Jump to episode three. WTF was that? Maybe because it was a week between episode 2 and 3, but it was a mass of confusion introducing so many characters where you have no clue what is going on. It appears all characters have some kind of hidden connection, as well as all seem to be playing both sides, while the hero is the only righteous character. My wife and I both had zero idea where this is going, nor care anymore. On a side note, I love Amy Ryan as an actress. She is horrid in this. Terrible acting, and a ridiculous character.
1	Unfortunately, I can't way how far the key plot decisions in the series are from the original, though judging from other Netflix adaptations they might be quite far off. Either way, many character decisions and happenings raise questions, are inconsistent and ungrounded - which makes it hard to enjoy at times.That said, it's a good show from many perspectives: it's very well shot and put together, the CGI looks adequate and suitable, great international cast are all doing a great job (though I wish some would have more screen time), and the general premise of the series is appealing: it is, in a nutshell, a believable (yet horrifying) circumstances.I'm not sure I'd suggest it for watching, at least not yet - there's never a guarantee the show will be concluded till it is, and right now in addition to the plot issues it's far from finished.
0	"Greys Anatomy is a poorly written show, contant overdramatizing of events, annoying characters and a show built off cheap cookie cutter drama. Acting is atrocious on so many levels. Ive unfortunately been able to see this show multiple times, younger with my mom and numerous times as an adult. Never has a show been so basic with such stale performances and people treat it like its ""The Sopranos"". Its medically inaccurate all the time (even though its the most popular medical show) 20+ seasons of borderline unwatchable tv. Numerous continuity issues throughout the show. The writting is just straight up terrible at times. Its an example of whats wrong with TV. A show with no artistic vision or integrity. Its just constant confict combined with annoying characters all while being one of the most medically inaccurate shows of all time."
1	I can only give my own personal opinion here, HOWEVER, I think many would agree with what I'm about to say. I used to spend my ENTIRE week waiting for Thursday for 8 whole seasons. I LOVED the characters, the drama, the emotions. I was so into it that my husband would make fun of me. Grey's Anatomy hour meant NO TALKING hour!! I was so in love with the series that to this day I watch older seasons on Netflix once or twice a year! Up to the middle of the 9th season that is....**SPOILERS**We were all sad when they killed Denny, though he wasn't a main character, he would have made a good one, I think we all loved Izzie and Denny. And we were ABSOLUTELY DEVSTATED when George died! Those were okay though, we could got through those and it was great in between and I didn't care even a little bit when Burke left, I never cared for him.BUT THEN.... The plane crash!! What an amazing couple of episodes, until you got to the end of them and realized that up to this point they had killed off 40% of the main cast AND your favorites none the less!! Lexi and Mark!! REALLY!! They were just getting ready to get back together! It was simply too much.Killing off so many main characters didn't do the series any favors, and adding the characters that they did, it RUINED it. Amelia? Ugh she's so annoying, her character has a daddy/big brother complex that she cant seem to get over so she's constantly in a power struggle with men. Its nauseating, I dislike her character very much. Meredith's sister though, I hate her so much I cant even remember her name, she's HORRIBLE!!! HORRIBLE actress, HORRIBLE, character, HORRIBLE for the show!! Just single handedly dragging the series the bottom. Not to mention killing Jackson & April's baby!! WHAT!! Too much!So my personal opinion of this series is, I'm hooked, I have to see it through, but I recommend not watching after midway through the 9th season, its a waste of time and will likely only annoy. I'm giving it a generous 6. Now it used to be a strong 10 and the only reason it still gets a 6 is because of how amazing it USED to be. If I was going by the last 2.5 seasons alone.... I regret to say it would have only a 2.After last nights 4/23/15 episode I am LIVID!! How could Shonda Rhimes make such a big mistake!! I Guarantee this will be the last season because nobody is going to watch it anymore now that she has killed 97% of the original cast/main characters! Not to mention our favorites!! I'm giving up seeing this one through. Last night was the final episode of Grey's Anatomy that I will ever watch, old or new. What an epic failure. My ALL TIME FAVORITE series went from just that to my most hated one. YOU Don't KILL 97% OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS! Color me disappointed and sad. :( Goodbye Grey's, you were my favorite!
2	They could have writen a good last season, but they didn't. They should have made a full season for building up the tension. One moment they are in Winterfell, the next at Kings landing.
0	Please dear god do not make any more shows for the Fallout series. I was really excited about this show coming out but in all reality the first episode was just ok, a the 2nd one made me not want to watch anymore. If this show was created to make me not want to see or play fallout anymore then you've succeeded. The Fallout games are a 10/10 and the show was just a huge disappointment. It feels like the everyone involved have never picked up a controller to play the game. If the show had a complete rework, it could possibly be good but as it stands I don't know why people are rating this show so high.
0	More Netflix mediocrity, who is surprised really at this point ? They'd do anything to push their narrative of big boss woman, even if it makes absolutely no sense. There is absolutely no character development, nothing remotely exciting, tons of inconsistencies. Eliza Gonzalez is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. Her lips are so messed up from injections they barely move when she talks. Her character is annoying and obnoxious. Could barely stand even looking at her. Empty shell of an actress. I had so much hope for this show, really. But Netflix disappoints as usual. This show just shows how Netflix's mediocrity has destroyed the movie industry. Read the book or skip the show.
0	The thing here is that if you've watched the original Chinese adaption of the book Three body then you will be left wanting by this version.It's much quicker paced but at the cost of so many details that are really supposed to be in there to make it truly good.Sadly 95% of the people will never know what they are missing and I guess for them this might still seem like a good show. I can only imagine what they would have thought about it if they knew better.If the reviewers could compare it to the Chinese version like me, this one would not currently have the same rating as the original. Because it simply does not deserve a similar rating.It gets the message across but it hurts to see it done in such a rudimentary way.
2	Baby Reindeer is dark and gritty from the start. Jessica Gunning takes the role of the stalker to truly sinister levels and plays the part superbly well. The story is compelling and the less you know about it the better. You'll wonder how this is all real, but the events that occur probably wouldn't occur the same way in fiction. But life isn't fiction and that is what makes this series so powerful.Richard Gadd plays the lead role after living these events in his life. It is brave of him to have written and to star in his own true story, particularly a story with such horror and heartache.It's a riveting watch!8/10.
1	I've been watching Grey's Anatomy since season 1. Safe to say I am a fan. For anyone who is new to the series, the first few seasons are great, naturally over the years, it's lost a bit of steam but still very watchable. However, come 2021 and I am so disappointed like never before.The show has become very political- racism, inequality and COVID are the main themes. In as much as I am all for this...... BUT not when I just want to be entertained and watch a tv show to escape/switch off from the realities of life.There were a few episodes this season that were not necessarily political but fell flat and boring which I put down to the issue of COVID and maybe the writers unable to use what they had initially planned for the season.Honestly, they would have been better off skipping this year if this is what they were going to produce. Just not entertaining and fun anymore. It's become quite bleak really.I've noticed this is not the only show that has gone down this route, few others have as well. I personally find it very frustrating. Yes let's bring about change but can we do so on a different platform.
0	I liked the story lie- as far fetched as it is, but the characters are nasty His partner is a mean small spirited woman and the Sargent ( Jones) is equally mean. His fellow officers are just a bust- the one criticism I have aside from the characters is the pancake makeup on NF- it looks like he should be in a coffin .
1	Wife wanted to watch this show. Could get it on Netflix. First season, we both enjoyed it. Second season still pretty good. Through the third season, I was getting tired of it. Tired of drama queen George. Wife was disappointed that Izzy got over her love for Denny so fast. Tired of Meredith. After the first episode of the fourth season, we both gave up and quit watching it. We are amazed it has lasted eighteen seasons.
0	"Well, would you look at that! Review after review panning the social justice writing of season 3! And I'm not going to be any different! After all, woke = broke! So, you wanted to take a perfectly good show, that had captured a respectable viewership, and turn it into a chopping block candidate 3 episodes into the FINAL season? Brilliant! There's some REAL business sense right there! Show me ONE woke show that actually works! ONE! And you, rocket scientists that you are, thought ""Hey! The Rookie has been doing pretty good! Maybe it's a strong enough show to carry our woke 'White cops are clueless and/or bad' message all the way to the endzone!"" How's that working out for you? It's 4th and 20 at your own one yard line! If episode 4 tanks, hey chopping block, here comes the Rookie!So here's an idea you won't listen to: go home, pull the staples out of your cheeks, and wash the neon dye out of your hair! In the morning, put on some respectable clothes! You know, the kind that George Clooney wears when he goes out to dinner. Go to the studio and pretend that you fit into society! Meaning, rather than trying to force society to conform to you, why not do a little conforming yourself! Do that for four episodes (before you drive everyone away) and see if the reviews get better or worse! After reading some of your current reviews, I can't see how anything could get worse, but at this point, since you're next in line for that chopping block, I don't think you have anything to lose! That's just a little friendly advise from me to you! Remember, WOKE = BROKE!"
0	Rookie was one of my favourite shows. I loved how it was well written and light-hearted. It focussed on the characters within the series and how they developed and cops and how they handled the odd situations they came across.Season 3 however is a disaster. Every story, every sentence, has an agenda. It is heavily biased and it detracts from the well loved characters and their personalities. The agenda isn't even factual. For example :a black woman is pulled over for running a red light. She is found to have a stash of guns in the car. She claims they belong to her ex and gives a sob story about how she was confiscating them and delivering them to the police station. She admits stealing her husbands property and breaking into his house with a key to do so. She gets arrested by the evil white guy cop while Jackson looks on in anger. He claims she should have never been arrested. So the writers here want the police to believe every story they are told without question and want the police to ignore obvious felonies ! Instead they want them to have sympathy !-another one, Lucy berates Tim for being too harsh on a group of Latino gardeners that they pulled over when she had first started patrolling with him. She claims he was to harsh on them and that he should have considered how hey felt even though they had several violations against them. So again the writers want the police to consider the feelings of criminals and potential criminals. The writers actually want the police to stop and think about this before they make a move ! Have the writers ever actually been involved with real police work ?I wouldn't mind if the subject was touched upon, or they made series 3 involve a long running incident about a single act of police brutality. For example i think it would have been good if they had a felon die in their custody suite, then involve the fall out in subsequent episodes - for example show how the rookies deal with a riot against their station etc. But no - instead it is lots of heavily one sided sub plots that do nothing more than show the ignorance of the writers and their determination to tick boxes !It just detracts from what was a good show and it is a shame.
1	The critique is not to do with the final fates of character. Instead it's with the overall production of the final season. It's as if they changed directors, editors, and writers. Season 8 had novice filming mistakes, timing and overall all flown issues. It was a gravely disappointing end product. We're all left to day dream how we'd have done it differently. Now if George R. R. Martin would ever get to finishing the written series, we might get a consistent to the text, quality ending. Please finish. Mr. Martin. Please.
1	It is a fact that the writing has gone downhill in this show. It is a fact that the last couple of episodes and/or seasons were rushed and under-developed. It is a fact that the character development was thrown out of the window. It is a fact that D&D are solid adapters, but very lousy writers (fellowship of the wight storyline must be the stupidest thing I've ever seen on TV).It is also a fact that the casting was just perfect - as a book reader, I couldn't have wished for better actors; not just their resemblance and accuracy, but (most of) their acting was superb. It is also a fact that visuals are stunning - the locations were brilliantly selected, sets were magnificently built, costumes were beautifully chosen, special effects are amongst the best on TV at the moment (probably the best). It is also a fact that the score is otherworldly, I honestly don't have words to describe how perfect all of it is (kudos to Ramin Djawadi). It is also a fact that all of the directors did an amazing job, considering all the different dimensions and sets this show has (grand battles, silent dinners, feasts, war meetings, conquers, casual conversations...).It is not THE best show ever. It is not a perfect show. But it certainly broke ground, it certainly set the standard high for the next great epic TV show and it certainly was (and will remain) a global phenomenon that should be remembered for all of its qualities.
2	"But still a show worth the watch and overall well done.Some characters got obnoxiously stale with the same stick up their rumps the entire season with seemingly no development or change, which you can never know on this side of the screen if it was the actors choice or the directors. Nonetheless, there were numerous brilliant and full performances from many that far out weighed the limited performances of one or two, making for a well rounded group of characters.The writing was overall good, but ironically left some pretty novice holes for someone pretentiously referring to C. S. Lewis as a terrible writer simply due to the writers nonsubtly repeated bias towards theasim.Some parts were hilariously poor planned with a good number of plot holes any half sober viewer would point out: ""Wasn't the whole point of this plan to avoid mass destruction to a ship, unlike shootin the damn thing with a missile? Well the whole thing is a flaming pile of rubble now, I guess you sure got lucky you missed slicing up the thing you didn't even know what was, and more lucky you found it""""Heli's and swat canvassing the whole area and no one sees the broad shot through the calf crawling like a snail wide out in the open?""""Same broad who seems to be their only means of assassinating anyone at any needed time across the globe, lives in a generic, unsecured, vulnerable trailer without means of immediate transportation? Why would they not set her up with a batcave of sorts.""""Fifteen plus years the judgement day cruisers have been talking to these things, they've already read half a book on fairy-tales, they've been monitoring all our activity globally, they ask more questions than a three year old, and they're JUST NOW stumbling across the concept of a lie?""I could go on and on about little overlooked lazy plot holes in the writing, and wouldn't even mention them if the writers hadn't been so obviously and obnoxiously egotistical about their own abilities and intellect. But if you're going to jab historically renowned writers of the past, you had better be at least on par with your peers of the present.They are not.But, they did adapt an engaging story from someone else's work that seems to be written well (only guessing from the compelling main plot that I assume was copy pasted from the source material).So I'm still thankful it was made.I think this is worth the watch and am looking forward to future seasons. Not looking forward to waiting. Boo hoo first world problems.But I'd really appreciate seeing the conclusion of this series before the whole world blows itself up in world War three, and I really can't be so sure anymore (he says half sarcastically through gritted teeth).So please show runners, do make haste."
1	"I'm struggling through the series, and I haven't even finished episode 3. Had to watch Plein Soleil with Alain Delon to remind myself why I'm so fascinated by the book and character so much.I usually have no problem with black & white, but shooting in Italy, all those gorgeous locations, it's just a dumb choice.Anthony Minghella's version, in my opinion, is the best. Jude Law is the perfect characterization of Greenleaf. And I haven't seen any actor play Freddy better than Philip Seymour Hoffman.But what to say about the casting of this miniseries? Andrew Scott is a great actor and I loved him as the hot priest in Fleabag (but where did all that sexy vibe go? You won't find it in this series, that's for sure). The guy who plays Greenleaf wouldn't be able to seduce anyone. There's no chemistry between him and Marge, or, more relevantly, him and Ripley. His character is irrelevant. I wouldn't mind if he got murdered in the first episode.And, although Dakota is an actor I respect, she's just miscast and flat. Gwyneth Paltrow did a better job. Minghella knew he had to have a ""Grace Kelly"" Marge. And she did that perfectly.Matt Damon is a terrific actor, though I'm not sure he was well suited for the part. But it was interesting. While Delon was too handsome for the part, Damon, preferred to play it more awkwardly. I thought it was a bright choice.I've read lots of comments regarding the age of the actors. I confess it's strange at first, but that's not why the series falls flat.I might just watch again Minghella's version or Saltburn (totally obsessed with this film!) And the Saltburn cast would have totally kicked ass in this series, by the way. Add Anya Taylor-Joy as Marge, and you'd have a dream cast."
1	"Let me start off with one thing. The ""science"" part is absolute nonsense. In each and every aspect throughout the flick. The fiction part is kind of bearable, although there's so much garbage in it, it's laughable at times. Like multidimensional aliens traveling at 1% of speed of light, but instantly sending modded photons to Earth and operating with data, measured in bytes. And as that is not hilarious enough, let's do our currently popular earthling thing and mock up conspiracies, do some virtue signaling, but bring cryonics as plausible scientific method. Well, I'll be damned.Won't even open up on the nixie tube countdown ""effect"", that takes 60% of one's vision as it's ridiculous. Both visually and as a concept. Also ridiculous is the digital noise used to symbolize alien communication. And the cherry on top - the VR thing. Jesus! Who even needed this in the plot in the first place? Consumer VR's been physically around for 30+ years now; the concept for few more decades. Did we just find it's few centuries futuristic?And there's an elephant in the room I need to address. Why was Clarence's son even featured as a character if his only purpose was to tell the viewer something no one cares about. That, he, literally another random halfbrained lazy unemployed brat, is also mohoxesual. Like yeah, okay mate, whatever, doesn't make you any less useless on global scale innit? Probably they should start with your spoiled generation, for all I care.And yet, weirdly enough, it didn't annoy me as much as I expected another lousy book adaptation would do. Still, there's this hanging question. Why did not they just blow entire population's heads remotely via them sophons, instead of going through all the hassle? Would have had a clean and perfectly eco-friendly planet to enjoy upon arrival."
0	"Haven't read the books, haven't seen the Chinese series. Watching this show, starts very interesting, discovering whats happening, slow paced, mysterious, good plot..up until 5th episode.Then it turns into a disappointment from David and David, once again. I dont know if these dudes have a limited potion of creativity for their shows, where if they use much in the beginning there is none left for the ending.Starting from the ship scene, where the military discussion is what is the best and quickest way to get the harddrive, without casualties and without putting the drive in danger of being destroyed... Yet they choose the most dangerous method of slicing everything and the ship burns.. But they do find the drive undamaged ofc.Aliens who are so advanced to travel in spaceships with 1% speed of light, and sophons to change our reality, actually cant find a closer place to live and terraform (i dont even know if they breathe oxygen, as they say they dont look like humans at all and are multidimensional beings) but they just decide to come and destroy humans and live on earth... Ofc.Building a capsule with a parachute that opens into space(in vacuum)..precisely following a route where atom bombs are set that explode right between the parachute and the capsule... I'm amazed how they managed tonput those atom bombs so quickly, what materials were used to protect the chute and the capsule (with a half-frozen human inside) that protects from atomic blast and radiation... Ofc.Im not even going to mention how amazing is that five friends from school have the luck to be the inventor of nanotechnology polymer, a physicist who solves the game and the space problem, the guy who in his mind will find the solution and the guy who is dying so is the perfect candidate to travel frozen to the aliens(and still don't get why)..I'm totally going to not laugh at the poor attempts to create a drama of love interests and pointless conflicts, same as the attempt to create guilt to anyone not working for the ""human"" side... Same side that in reality destroys it self and this planet every day, but even a common alien enemy cannot bring together.I think the biggest slap in the face will be from Netflix when they cancel this show in the middle, as they do.."
0	When Greys started, it was brilliant and tge last few seasons have been so boring. So bored of Meredith Grey acting like a brat allllllll the time. I dont get why she thinks the world owes her a favour.Time to hang the scrubs up.
0	In the book there are 4 wallfacers but in the show there are 3 and guess what! One of them is the member of Terorist ognization YPG backed by US in Syria. Also from the science fiction perspective sophon thing is not that much feasible. Giving all the keys of world to 3 wallfacers oh! From the scientific base of books built There is a good point of view, however when you combined all the science with the development of characters and fiction of scriptwriter. Its starting to lose meaning. Development of characters in the books might be much more detailed or the same comment is valid for the fictional development of the story. However in the end we are watching the story written by script writers who interted lots of political manipulation into story like Leyla Aric kurdish terorist organization member given as a war hero.
1	I am still hooked on Alain Delon's diabolic charmingness. He had all the ingredients required for the character. The Plein Soleil captures the essence of Patricia Highsmith's 1955 novel. The 1999 film needed more artistry. Matt Damon was the worst of Mr. Ripley, and the movie was the worst of the remakes. However, I like the new remake on Netflix with Andrew Scott and Johnny Flynn. They are too old for the characters, and Dakota Fanning performs flatly. Amazingly, Highsmisth's psychological thriller has endured for more than 70 years as one of the best psychological thrillers adapted to movies.
0	One could argue that just because the last season is completely abysmal, that shouldn't detract from early seasons. However, when so much of the show is build-up for the finale - storylines you have to wade through for seasons in the hope+expectation they're going somewhere - then the final season's awfulness really does detract from the entire product.As an example - the whole white walker build-up and related Bran Stark storyline just basically comes to nothing. We never even really learn what it was all about, and it just ends so abruptly. Similarly Danaerys' whole storyline just ends so nonsensically after all the time spent following her. Jaime Lannister's whole arc ends in a nonsensical mess. Etc etc.A show whose core strength was its story+characters - a show which could shock viewers, but always in ways which in the early seasons entirely made sense given the characters' character - devolving into such a nonsensical mess. The last season is a pure cash grab made by talentless people with no interest anymore in working to deliver a half-decent ending to what they'd spent seasons building up. I just hope George R. R. Martin actually finishes the last books and manages to give the story a more satisfying ending which shows-up how pathetic in comparison Hollywood's attempt to write its own ending was (and yes, of course he is somewhat to blame for not finishing the books before the TV show reached the end).
0	Just finished season 8. An advice to the writers and scenarists: stay of the coke and don't drink so much. Perhaps it will improve your work. Never seen a more abominable scenario. A man gets stabbed in the guts twice wit a dagger that goes in till the hilt and then walks a mile or so and is still heathy enough to speak a dialogue?? Cynical and ironical Tyrion turns into a weeping dweep?? A dragon - well I don't know about dragons - but spouting fire endlessly?? Destroying a city when you only have to take apart the main building to get your enemy?? And so on and so on.. Stay off the booze boys an stick to writing commercials!!
0	If this show's name is not 3 body problem,I will give it 10/10 for its fancy CG ,music and suspension story ,but it's not!!!!I can't find any respect to the original novel. The death count down was a great setting in the novel.leading the characters to find out what trouble they are in and show how scientists use their wisdom and strength to break mist. But in this show it showed up in a bloody suicide scene? Like it's a Strange horror gimmick. And what is going on with the 🍻 pub scene? A shallow man try to hook up with two girls and they show how intelligent and independent they are by saying their identity are replacement and plot tool the writer creat to fill the plot hole he dig during his adaptation?At the end let's talk about it's political correctness problem. To me it's more unbearable than the little mermaid(Live action version). Under the adaptation that basically destroyed everything in the novel for diversification. The creators showed no respect to Chinese. Where the novel's writer is from.
2	Sugar is a new LA noir private detective show that works both as a hommage to the genre and a self serious meta parody with all the cliches imaginable. After 2 episodes it's difficult to tell where it will go but I like it for the moment.Colin Farrell is great as usual and succeeds in giving gravitas to a character that for the moment is paper thin. We feel he has a past and relationships and traumas and an inner life.I reserve the right to revise my note according to the evolution of the next episodes. Many shows started great and collapsed very fast (the Apple TV+ Godzilla show for example). Let's wait and see.
0	"This could be a very good show, if not for the fact that most of the characters can not complete a full sentence without pausing, stuttering, stammering, winding off topic, then finally finishing the thought and then repeating it, sometimes more than once. Also, virtually every character, including guest stars react the same way when faced with a devastating situation. In the episode ""Freedom: Part 1, a young couple are both being treated for cancer. When the young man dies, his girlfriend reacts by repeatedly crying out, ""Don't say anything to me. Don't say anything to me."" When Callie built legs for a patient who died, she kept yelling, ""I made his legs, I made his legs, I made his legs!"" These are only two examples of many. Shonda Rhimes must think that all people have the same reaction to grief/heartbreak/devastation because it is the response she uses so often. I find most of the characters to be self-absorbed, hypocritical, and egotistical. This is especially true of Meredith who I perceive as completely narcissistic, unbearably whiny, and her ""cute"" stammering, nervousness is incredibly annoying."
1	Interesting but Over Indulgent, Over Padded and Over CookedOscar winning director/writer Steven Zaillian gives us another incarnation of the fascinating Tom Ripley character most famously portrayed by Matt Damon in 1999's The Talented Mr. Ripley but also seen in several other films. This version though is all the 1999 version as Ripley (Andrew Scott) goes to Italy to buddy up to Dickie Greenleaf (Johnny Flynn) and assume his identity. Ripley's sudden involvement irks Greenleaf's girlfriend Marge (Dakota Fanning) and friend Freddie (Eliot Sumner) who have their doubts.The 1999 version was close to perfection as a taut, tantalizing thriller with excellent performances across the board. This version is slick, scrumptious to look at and has a visually arresting, stylish aesthetic. Having the story shown in black and white is initially distracting in early episodes as it feels pretentious but is used to interesting visual effect. Shades of Hitchcock is very evident. Beautiful cinematography, lush technical qualities, excellent music score make this a polished production.The story wobbles though. Like a lot of streaming programs today, this doesn't justify 8-episodes. A lot of it is padding, long drawn-out scenes of characters doing absolutely nothing. Weird because it omits a lot from the story (which we get to later). There's episodes where the lead is just wandering around looking into nothing.The story is also a bit of a mess. All for artistic freedom and creativity but it deviates a lot from the original story but doesn't really add anything in. The Dickie character is killed off very early and there's a few episodes just of Ripley doing nothing much. The Freddie character comes in one episode, disappears completely until they are back for their murder scene but by then we've had just one scene of the character so we're not invested in anything about this person. The disposing of Freddie's body takes a LONG time (a good 30 minutes) of Ripley driving around Italy to dispose a body. Again the padding is extraordinary. The Marge character disappears throughout and there is a lack of chemistry between her and Dickie only because they barely have any screen time together. Curious to why the 8-hours is focused on long, extensively drawn out scenes of the lead just walking by himself around Italy. A few characters from the original are also omitted presumedly to let us see more of Scott walking around Italy as if he is a man on some mission.The cast are fine but struggle to match the committed performances of the film. Dakota Fanning fares best by injecting a compassionate yet suspicious girlfriend. Johnny Flynn is OK but its hard to like him - a flaw which Jude Law combatted so perfectly in his award-nominated take. The Dickie character is just boring and not fun at all. Eliot Sumner's variation of Freddie is odd to say the least. Andrew Scott as the titular character is practically in every scene - 8 hours' worth of Scott really. There's a commitment to his performance for sure but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Damon's variation had depth - Scott's version is wooden, stiff and confusing. He walks around empty like some cyborg. Even the scenes he is supposed to be ravishing with intensity - he is monotone.By episode 6, I was getting pretty tired of watching Scott walking around the dead of night through Italy, up and down stairs, across the street, staring into a window...Not a total skip, but it's definitely a fast forward program to get through. There's about 3 hours of wasted time on indulgence.Beautiful to look at, empty in its core.
1	I mean it's ok.I need to read the books apparently because whoever did the casting and writing for this show are Young-Adult-Fiction terrible. The only saving grace cast-wise at all is Wong and Cunningham.Beauty queen world-leading nano-tech researchers? C'mon. Is there really a rich snack-mogul in the books? That's gotta be Netflix re-write crap, right?What about the woman theoretical physicist who gets a pair of goggles happens to be dating the tough navy guy the super-secret agency people want to hire to help combat the aliens!? ... so dumb.Please stop writing shows and movies for people who stare at their phones half the time and write stories for people who pay attention to the actual content.It gets interesting with the story and then suddenly an inexperienced actor appears and ruins it with a scientific explanation that makes them sound like they're reading a queue card.It's not great, but I've seen worse.
0	The whole thing spins around people not realizing Ripley has taken over Richard's identity, but at some point way before the end would not someone have wanted to see what one or both looked like, especially since they wanted to find them? And the rich guy certainly moved in circles where his picture would have been taken and appeared in mags or newspapers.And how could the inspector not recognize that Ripley was the same guy he interviewed as Richard. What with his voice not disguised and his mannerisms in plain view.Some pretty scenery, and nice photography, and a great performance by an observant cat, but poor casting (ages, lack of charisma) doom this effort.
0	It's one of the few cop shows I will watch. It's as accurate as television usually gets with police work, minus the numerous reports per shift. I always enjoy Nathan Fillion and I'm glad he's in another great show.
0	Until the penultimate season, very good, of the best. Last season destroyed everything. The penultimate episode reminded me of the illogical horror films, the clueless couple enters an abandoned house or goes to the middle of the bush in the dark without any sense. It left my list of best series, but it does not matter ... they already had the expected profit.
0	I love science fiction and I was excited about this series after the first episode (I didn't read the books that it is based on). The premise seemed exciting and the story felt like it was going to be smart. However, from the third episode on, it felt like the producers were just filling time and had to meet their contractual obligations to deliver the streaming service an eight episode show whether the story required it or not. For example of the fluff, there is a scene where one of the characters takes a bath...we get to see her get into the tub and we watch her think and think about her angst for a really longtime...it's already been pounded into out heads a dozen times that she has angst...unnecessary streaming series fluff! Most of the episodes seem like filler...too much time is spent on relationship angst and unrequited love. This story would have worked better as a medium length movie rather than this dragged out 8-episode borefest.
0	"Please, God. Put this turkey, its wooden actors and unimaginative scriptwriters out of their misery, please.I have never seen a series descend from good / excellent to dismal / appalling in such a short passage of time.What happened ???Everything seemed to be going well until the relationships started firming up. There seemed to be a concerted effort to bolster the female characters' importance to every situation at the expense of their significant others.Anyway, this latest episode, featuring Dim and Juicy, means 'lights out' as far as I'm concerned. To paraphrase the Bard ""Farewell, sweet Rookie, may Angels sing thee to thy rest"""
2	"I enjoyed the show a lot as a fan of game series, but the plot has incredible inconsistencies, not related to games, just bad setups, that I doubt will hold up on second viewing.I still consider the show massive success and can't wait for second season, but I hope following issues won't repeat in following season.The show has major issue with writing. Most of the major conflicts/situations are setup in a completely nonsensical way just to create drama, when upon resolving it you find the whole setup does not make sense at all in regards to characters motivations. Ie initial setup makes sense upon first viewing, not knowing all information, but once you understand who the characters are and their motivations, the initial setup makes absolutely no sense and is not something that the characters would ever do. Writers essentially need to create drama and violence in this show, while also having characters who sometimes turn out good. But the writing is somewhat poor, so the way they do it is to render the characters bad/evil and then resolve it as ""hey, we are the good guys actually"", which falls apart, because the whole initial conflict could be resolved with 5 minute talk, which they can't have, because then none of it would make any sense.Spoilers:1) Right at start, the whole setup with raiders coming in and brutalizing everyone makes absolutely no sense upon finishing the season. Moldaver as the villain was clearly not a villain and while as everyone in wasteland is perfectly fine with violence that whole massacre makes zero sense. Why did she not say what the overseer did? Did she not know everyone else in the vault is clearly innocent? Before massacring everyone they could have, you know, talk or hold them captives and get only the overseer for the code they needed. But no, the show needed to create villain and get some violence in, so at start they created characters that were brutal and barbaric, which then absolutely does not hold up. That was not justified violence to have a revenge after Shady Sands, that was just plain massacre to give motivation to Lucy and have over the top violence at start. Moldaver was clearly extremely smart character as we find out during the season, yet at start her actions are irrationally brutal and she has zero ability to communicate to the people she is about to massacre, why? I will tell you why, because show runners wanted to create evil mysterious character, who we will slowly find out she actually is and has supposed ""depth"". But that does not work when that character actually behaves like a brutal idiot who can't tell innocent people that the guy who was their leader literally nuked the surface. But later on we are supposed to buy she is reasonable person who has altruistic motives in heart. If the story and characters acted reasonably and not like idiots, there was no reveal at the end, whole vault would be told what happened right at the start. Ie its fake drama, that is not believable, because characters don't act in a believable way true to who they are supposed to be.2) At one of the early episodes we see Goggins fight T-60 operated by Maximus who does not even have a training and it's a pretty long fight where Goggins struggles. Ie its early on and T-60 has to still be established as a super weapon. Then magically at last episode Goggins remembers T-60 have build flaw and can be essentially taken down by one shot ( sure, literal walking tank have armor flaw on the chest armor, whatever, I am not going to even talk about that ). Anyways, writers dot this, because they failed to create any better resolution to the whole fight at the end, so they bring Goggins in with his magic bullet trick to take down army of T-60s, because now he remembered he can do that. I am sorry, but that's just awful and made the whole resolution of the final fight a complete joke to me.3) The whole section with Vault with mutated inhabitants who were actually nice was equally stupid. Again, it was mostly fun, but the entire premise is stupid. They could literally tell them at begging, ""hey some of us were experimented on way back and that's why we have these mutations. Don't go to level 12 please, there is some stuff from that time. ""But again, writers needed to create drama, so while the characters are actually nice, they make them act whole time shady and suspicious, so that the main character thinks there is something wrong and audience thinks something is wrong as well. But there is not, it's just writers gaslighting audience with actions that make no sense for the actually nice characters. As in point 1, whole situation would be resolved in a roughly 2 minute chat, but they are not allowed to do that, because none of the motivations and actions of those characters would hold up. The whole gaslighting of main characters and audience to think they bring in people just to experiment on them was just gaslighting. There is actual reason why they did have the mutations, which they could easily explain to them. They do anyway in the end!!! But that would make too much sense early on and then we don't have episode. Perhaps having characters who can behave consistently at start of the episode and it's end would be better.Anyways, I realy like the show, there were many good things about it mentioned by others in it to compensate all the inconsistencies, but I hope the next season can do without these."
2	"I never written a review but had to for this show since I would be considered an ""OG"" of the Game series . I've been waiting years and years for a show and we finally got one . I'm stoked for season 2 seeing new Vegas gave me a rush . What can we expect to see . The House ? The boomers ? Caesars legion ? Great khans ? The kings ? Id like to see the institute or Railroad eventually but thats whats great about this series . The possibilities are endless . The FO series is set up with tide turning action and drama situations but also has great corky weird scenarios and characters to give it that missing ingredient of dark humor and Comedy in general . Love how you are all bringing the wasteland to life .i love how they follow a few different characters. Continue to raise the bar and drop jaws . Hopefully we begin to see more games being adapted into shows and movies . It's kinda what every gamer who wants more of a game/genre wishes for. Looking forward to seeing Fallout merch and Games/game apps being available also .theres no way you can miss . This right here is pure gold you struck."
2	The first book is hard to make in to a series but I think the first 8 episodes was pretty good. This series goes bananas in the second book so I really hope we get a second season.Lots of changes in this adaptation but It makes more sense for a western version.Great job with cgi and casting. The story is kind of slow but it grows into a terrifying nightmare. And ends a bit early. I would have like too see the time jump of the second book in the end.I guess they could have told about the Dark Forest Hypothesis. That would have made more sense in the end. But for being a Netflix series this is the best series they made in years.
1	Please stop this show. It become ridiculous. The first 6 seasons were good but then is really really bad.
0	"The lite police drama is nice but as a CA native with friends who were actually LAPD its unrealistic that there are no gay or lesbian characters. Almost every other new show is acknowledging and being inclusive. The new buzz word is fluid and this show has no fluidity. It is always amazing to me when shows like this get great reviews while superior shows ""almost family"" (IMO) get canceled but have similar audience scores on rotten tomatoes. Anyway, it is nice to see a show not based on the supernatural or animation."
2	The plot structure is complete, the details are rich, and the creativity is infinite. On the premise of maintaining the flavor of the original, the TV play is more concise and the key points are more prominent. The characters of the play are bright and wonderful. The whole play is not only magnificent in scenes and exquisite in production, but also exquisite in photography, clothing, setting and art. The plot integrates a variety of elements and is dressed in magic. However, it reflects the real world in the illusion, and focuses on the struggle of political power.
0	Season 8 the first 2 episodes were good suspenseful however I cant say that for the rest of the season because things began to take place suddenly and the poor writing was one of the many problems in this season. Season 1-7 were the greatest in my opinion in terms of writing, direction, suspense, and drama
0	So I've managed to watch almost 2 episodes of this before giving up. If this was an original show, I may have given it the benefit of a doubt, but the creators here have taken on one of the best Sci Fi novels ever written and handled it with the reverse Midas touch, hiring an untalented cast and writing in a bunch of utterly unbelievable characters. Seriously it was easier to believe in the supernatural events depicted than that moronic characters like Auggie or John could pass as groundbreaking scientists. Everything in the book was changed into a stupider version of events. Beautifully written storylines were rushed or discarded altogether, and yet production found the time to graciously spice things up with some unnecessary nudity. It's sad to see what Netflix seems to think of its brainless mass audience. Sad enough for me to cancel my subscription for good.I can only hope that one day another network might pick this trilogy up and treat it with the respect it deserves.Giving this more than 1 star for the visual effects and the China storyline.
1	"Don't get attached to any character. They'll eventually die. Love the show and overall character (one's that have lived this long) and story development over the years, even the obnoxious characters grow on you to a point. Although seasons before the current of Season 17, it's overall become predicable. Lovr the show but it needs to wrap up before it becomes anymore""same old"" vibe and it dies off after a large chunk of fans lose interest and stop watching."
0	While the actors all do their best with the material (hence the 3 stars), this is a badly written show. The Rookie is billed as a drama, but it lost me when John Nolan (Fillion) wasn't shot for standing up and running his mouth with clearly uptight and ready-to-shoot bank robbers. Yes, it was Nathan being Nathan, so it's cute - but the situation wasn't remotely believable. If it were set up for laughs that'd be one thing, but the scene is neither written nor played comically.After that, the show continues to lurch from one unbelievable scene to another. The women are all badass and the men - except for Nathan's character, all have a level of ickiness. Especially the one T.O. who is racist, sexist, and mean, but then, oh gee, we should feel sorry for him because his wife's a drug addict. Yeah,no. Oh, and of course, all the hot women nearly half his age love John Nolan on sight.The whole show is like a middle-aged white male fantasy - right up to the Kill Bill female cop that's Nolan's girlfriend. This is too bad, because the actual true story behind The Rookie is a compelling one. I know ABC wanted a new show for Nathan, but this isn't it. They should just reboot Firefly. After all, that's really what people want to see him in.
1	I really struggled to get through this tv serious. It does have its moments and at times intriguing, but way too much wishy washy unnecessary fluff for me, rather than moving on with the main story, or even telling it with any depth of detail.Like others have already mentioned, one big problem also is that the characters are just flat without any charisma. Making the show quite bland IMO.And because the story when told, is missing so much in-depth information, you can't help thinking are these major plot holes, when considering the number of light years away the invaders are.If you like Syfy shows like Apple's Invasion, Prime's Hanna, then you are probably going to like it. If you are one that enjoys shows like Battlestar Galactica, Silo, Tales from the Loop & For all Mankind, then the chances are you are not going to get much out of it except feeling tiresome watching it.
0	It's a shame, but nothing like the original story. Even if we consider this as an independent project: the characters are dead and a set of Netflix cliches without motivation, science is absent as well as the educational value of the entire trilogy, the insights and actions of the heroes are random. It is hardly possible to understand what is happening and why. I don't want to at least somehow empathize and sympathize with the characters and the world in the series. But the graphics in the game are not bad. After watching, I had a desire to re-read the books and watch the entire Chinese series in order to kill the negative aftertaste.
1	"The Seattle Grace / Grey Slaone hospital must be cursed. Half of their doctors die, there are bombings, natural disasters, shootings. Every single character has a crazy personal life and lacks common sense, some are completely irrational, and quickly become unbearable. Too much drama is too much drama, if it teaches us something, it is ""don't live by your emotions""."
0	I used to watch my son play the game and it seemed quite entertaining. I love quirky movies and television shows that most people do not enjoy. I fell asleep three times in two nights watching this program. I kept trying on night three, but it hasn't kept my interest. I'm supposed to write six hundred characters, but I don't find the need to denigrate any this tv show. The Fallout TV show was just not my cup of tea. Enjoy it if you wish. I just found it flat and boring. I guess I've never made a review before, because I find this character limit absolutely pointless too. I guess this is my last review.
1	I admit that I have binged watch the entire show at least 2 or 3 times, however, it should have ended a good 3 seasons ago at least. I feel like they don't know what to do with the show anymore, besides killing people off or having them move away. Since Mc Dreamy died, Meredith lost her flavour. Alex's exit was the last straw, especially the way he hurt Jo so terribly after renewing their vows (even if it was to be with his kids and fist love). Everything in between had some good but also too much drama just butchering everyone's relationships, like Arizona and Callie, how could you destroy a couple so many different ways?! Seriously! Teddy was good the first time around, but is now unbearable and Owen is as always intolerable. A good show needs to know when to call it quits, not leaving people hoping for it to end.
1	This is getting really silly at the beginning this show was like THE BEST enjoyed every minute of it and then they have decided that killing off characters is good for ratings and that wasnt enough actually they have also decided that we need crossovers from a different show that most of us hate.
2	Been fan of sci-fi series for a long time and this series comes as a pleasant surprise. And since it is a book adaption, surely there have been critics about its adaption especially when they did some westernization with characters and other things but as a watchers who didn't have a clue about the books, the series is splendid.Don't care if the book does certain things better, I didn't disappoint with the series. Surely it takes time but all things are justified with the answers given in an amazingly delivered ep.The choice of using western characters to replace chinese characters make sense if you appeal to a wider audience. And the cast did a great job.The direction is spot on. The visuals are gorgeous and scary tbh. And certain characters are well written and the actors performed them well like Wade, Shi, and Wenjie etc.I am excited for its return and looking forward to an impossible solution of 3-body problem.
2	Disclaimer: Not a book reader so might be missing some elaborative details A lovely science fiction based upon the theoretical possibilities. This series deserves some background, some knowledge of physics to even understand it so basically it has very narrow viewership and it takes guts to come up with something like that. Team deserves appreciation for that.The interesting dynamics of relationship between the superior aliens (in terms of science) coming to earth to save themselves from chaotic era in their planet and Humans is so neatly presented that you can't help but wonder when the series ends on a cliff hanger.
0	Those giving such stellar reviews have either not read the book or seen the original miniseries which was very faithful to the novel. I'm watching this, but it is a chore... If I was not intimately familiar with the story, I would be hard pressed to follow the plot of this production. Yeah, it's pretty and all, great costumes, but none of the characters are believable in their acting, except maybe Lord Yabu. Mariko looks and acts like she just flew in from modern day Tokyo. And Buntaro? What? There is so much deviation from the book that they should have named it something else. I was really looking forward to this new series, but I'm totally disappointed.
0	The first series was engaging, humorous and exciting- a rare combo. For some reason the writers of the second decided to put spurious social justice issues at the centre of every episode. It was like being lectured and hit over the head repeatedly by some left wing school teacher. No one believes this passes as entertainment surely ?
1	Read this novel when it was first released and again decades later. I found the first television series with Richard Chamberlain a disappointment mainly because it shortchanged the Japanese characters this has been rectified spectacularly in this new adaptation. The production values are excellent and very much enhances the spectacle of the series. Having the main characters speak in the native tongue was an excellent decision on the producer's enhancement of the production. The only quibble I have with the production is the choice of the actor who portrays John Blackthorne he is very wooden and unconvincing both physically and dramatically.
2	I read the book many years ago, and barely remember the first TV adaptation. This means I'm watching this new series for what it is, and very little, if any, expectations from either the book or the 1984 series.Two episodes in, I was considering this to be an easy 9 stars, with the possibility of reaching 10 by the end of the series. The cast is excellent, landscapes are beautiful, wardrobe superb, and the dialogs captivating. I was very happy to hear each character speaking his original language instead of that silly thing many productions do by having everybody speaking in english with stupid accents (remember Allô, Allõ!).And then, the show lost a star in my rating when a spanish character speaks in english with the englisman (who, at some point, claims to speak some portuguese). This becomes even more absurd when portuguese and spaniards speak english among themselves. And there are at least two portuguese actors who, again, speak english pretending to speak portuguese! Just pathetic and sad.Another star was lost when the main character starts describing the world, and how the portuguese and the spaniards divided the world in two. The acting is great and with a strong emphasis on how presumptuous it was for those two countries to assume they could just own the world.However, the historic innaccuracies are unacceptable in a show with so many resources available. How hard is it to do some research about the treaty of Tordesilhas?! They could've easily learn that it happened in 1494, about 100 years before the action of the show takes place and not 70 like mentioned by Blackthorne.But that could be a minor mistake until they start talking about how the portuguese and the spanish kings are working together to control the world. That never happened because Portugal and Spain were always enemies. In fact, the english were allies with Portugal even though the first being protestants and the latter catholics. And that description by Blackthorne becomes even more incorrect because it ignores the fact that at the time of the action and for the previous 20 years, Portugal was being ruled by the spanish kings (until 1640)!What a pity... This show could be quite better!
2	"The acting in this show is very good. There are some actors that are at different levels of their careers for sure, but overall the performances are excellent. The writing is for the most part very good, but I do wish sometimes they would slow down a little bit. I think sometimes they try to ""deliver"" and it comes at the cost of a more fleshed out story. This show has so many different nuances going on sometimes it can be a bit much to just ""enjoy"" I'm not familiar with the other versions of this story so it's a lot to take in at first. But with each episode the story does come together. A week between episodes does require a recap. I honestly thing all the bad reviews are quite harsh and not deserved. There are a lot of mediocre shows on these days. This is a big step up in quality."
1	If you can get past the cheese and the unrealistic set pieces , this is quite good. It's kind of like Lethal Weapon but trying to be seriousI have only watched 3 episodes so hope it gets better
0	IMDB does not allow profanities and without them I am unsure if I can express how badly this show disappointed me, here is my attempt.My main issue with this show is how far the quality of it fell. The writing of story, characters and dialogue in unrivaled in its utter failure to deliver interesting resolutions (when you get any at all), keep to the shows established/internal logic or for that matter to any previous standards.Quite possibly the worst show ever. Not because it was straight up terrible.But because it could have been so good, and ended up being so bad.
2	Rookie is a good show but get rid of the background music when people are talking. Know one can hear what the actors are saying and we have a great surround system.
0	"I was ready to give up by the middle of the third episode but slogged through to the end. Unless a character study of an irrational self-destructive (and likely mentally ill) person appeals to you, it's an unpleasant ordeal to sit through.The main character makes one irrational choice after another... ""what can I do to make my life even worse?""He want to be a stand up comedian - he's profoundly unfunny - and gets conned by some older guy who drops names and convinces him he's a professional writer (and never bothers to verify it, I guess he never heard of IMDB). He willingly takes drugs with the guy, the signs are there, then goes along with him to get ""totally wasted"" taking some clear liquid... winds up (in his unreliable narrator terms) being raped... keeps going back (even though his professional goals are not advancing in the slightest) does meth heroin, and even LSD, same result. More like stories that come out of the casting couch...He finds accounts on his stalker that show he's not the first yet can't figure out how to block her texts. He finally goes to the police but feels ambiguous about pursuing the complaint because he didn't report his other ""abuser"". Real moral ambiguity there! ""It's not fair to report this psychopath who's ruining my life because I didn't report the other one."" O-kay.And he's a leech. Lives rent-free in his ex-girlfriend's mother's house. How he earns money to pay for dates with his new girlfriend, who knows.And then he shows up at the abuser's house to visit him at the end of the series, God only knows why.He gets caught trying to entrap his stalker. He even sleeps with her after getting a court order to keep her away.He's not a trainwreck, he's the Titanic. I would have rated this lower if not for his finally admitting he's the source of his own problems. Finally."
1	I am surprised at the 9 and 10 star reviews here. I was awaiting this series after seeing a trailer for it a while back. I have played all of the Fallout games so I knew I would like this series. I loved the scenes with Lucy, the Vaults, and the Brotherhood. My lower review score is due to way too much time spent on the Ghoul's story. I didn't time it but it seemed like he had way more time spent on him than anything else.It came to a point where I began fast forwarding his slow, long winded scenes. I was hoping that Lucy would have kept exploring and picking up the cool weapons and encountering more of the creatures we see from the games. The very last scene was very predictable, but I won't mention it since I don't want to spoil it for others. I have yet seen a Prime series that I like have a complete series, so I wouldn't be surprised if this only lasts for one or two seasons.
0	The top scientists are a bunch of whiny overly emotional individuals who regularly get drunk or stoned like college kids. This is so unbelievable I could not take this story seriously. They also look like they strolled out right off the modeling walkway. Who thought this kind of casting and melodrama would aid a sci-fi series? And is the new thing for females to regularly threaten male characters with violence and this is supposed to be normal? I was floored when the most emotional scientist would rather let the world be conquered so she could go do humanitarian work in Mexico. The whole premise is a joke.
1	The aesthetic of this series is absolutely gorgeous. I enjoyed the black and white, and the contrast with the sharp, modern resolution. The cinematography reminded me of the movie Roma, and they both share a leisurely quietude, but the similarities end there.Roma managed to infuse itself with a quiet determination of character and moments of joy. This rendition of The Talented Mr Ripley spends too much time meandering through picturesque hallways and stairs, and not enough time establishing relationships and motive. Beautiful but empty.The casting was also all wrong. All three leads should be in their 20s, but only one is. And of course it's the female character who is young, paired with men who are obviously in their 40s. I wanted to be able to move past it, but it was too distracting, particularly in light of the glacial pacing. Ended up being a beautiful waste of time.
0	Extremely stupid conversations most of the time. Have a feeling it's made for 12 years old.Night king is the best actor and character. Only reason why I watched this.There is no need for spoilers because you know how it ends from the beginning.Dark scenes are made badly and too dark. I can't see nothing because of brightness.You can clearly see different directors during each epusode, different styles. Most of the time series are extremely boring. Love some great shots tho. Library scene in episode 3 season 8 is fantastic.Well, I can't understand why there is so much hype about this one. I mean this is worth one 2 hour movie not 8 seasons. Happy for people who loved this boring stretching.So bad story I don't want to write anything anything else.
1	The transitions are awful. A fade to black every five minutes. It constantly hops back and forth between four main characters.The story invalidated every game. But as a fan fiction it represents the games well. If the games had hardly any enemies.Only three creatures were represented in this show and only a single one... Everyone is either a bad actor or poorly directed, it's too nonserious, you never build emotion, tension and or any actual feeling.The CG is pretty rough and scaling isn't one to one with the games.A weak fallout plot, with daddy/abandonment and trust issues at the core of the writing.
1	Season 3 has a messy and hallucinatory script. Too bad.
0	This is a show made for the American audience, and yet most of it is in Japanese with subtitles. However, the people speaking English are supposed to be speaking Portuguese, what kind of sense does that make?The original with Richard Chamberlain didn't have the type of cruelty that the first episode shows. I suppose that's because today's audience wants something much more edgy, but it certainly doesn't appeal to me.Because it's a saga with interesting costumes, and an interesting location, I imagine it will find its audience, but just a warning to those of us who liked the book and the previous series, don't watch this show.
0	"The story is so far fetched that it is completely unbelievable snd an insult to science. No wonder with the ""scientists"" who are working on an imaginary problem. And I am not even talking about the inacceptable high number of miscast characters , especially those in England. Their specialty serms to be to communicate the f word in every second of their utterings. Shame of the screenwriters that seem to suffer from a lack of subtlety and intelligence. Afraid to say that this series has a lack of entertainment value and even for a scifi story is unrealistic and unconvincing. Do not waste the time on this."
0	It was great show, one of my favorite, but in these last few seasons its been pretty bad specially this one with covid, it's so bord that is barely bearable. Pls rather get closed with last episode where everyone is in than to continuing with this bad episodes in show.
1	I have never played the game, so my review is based on the TV show only.The world building and production quality is excellent. The sets, costumes, direction and cinematography are all great. The first few episodes grabbed my attention and held nearly all the way to the end.The problems came in the last couple of episodes. What happened in Vault 32? Don't know. Who cleaned it up? Don't know? Who poisoned the raiders and why? Don't know.Why didn't the self harm boot girl get punished? Don't know. Who gave her authority to decide who can be a knight? Don't know.I hope the attention to detail gets better in season two.
0	And stop watching after Sandra Oh leaves. It becomes mediocre at best.
0	"Plot Deviation: Rather than immersing audiences in the intricate world of interstellar conflict and mind-bending scientific concepts, the Netflix adaptation chooses to prioritize mundane drama over the essence of the source material. Instead of delving into the complexities of humanity's encounter with an advanced alien civilization, viewers are subjected to an excessive focus on characters' emotions, thoughts, and interpersonal relationships.Minimal Sci-Fi Content: The most glaring issue with this adaptation is the glaring absence of science fiction elements. Merely a fraction of the runtime is dedicated to exploring the fascinating scientific concepts and existential dilemmas that made the novel such a compelling read. Instead, viewers are left with lengthy stretches of tedious character interactions and melodramatic subplots that add little to the overarching narrative.Overreliance on Forward Button: Thanks to the forward button on the remote, viewers are given the power to bypass the tedious filler content that dominates the majority of the series. With approximately 75% of the runtime consisting of skippable material, one can't help but feel cheated out of the immersive sci-fi experience promised by the source material.Recommendation: For those daring to venture into the disappointing realm of ""The Three-Body Problem"" on Netflix, it's advisable to keep the remote handy. With judicious use of the forward button, what could have been eight hours of lackluster content can be condensed into a more manageable viewing experience of three hours or so."
2	"Ripley is a well directed series. It is a bit slow developing, however the cinematography and pacing is spot on. The entire series is done in black and white. Similar to another movie for this director (Schindler's list).I was hesitant to watch the series as I did not enjoy the theatrical version with Matt Damon. Possibly because I was a much younger man? Maybe I need to go back and watch it? Please reply with your thoughts.This is a binge worthy series. So get your popcorn and cuddle up with your significant other and enjoy. It can be a bit stressful watching Ripley do his thing. Just make note.Lastly, the singer ""Sting"" has a ""non binary"" daughter that plays ""Freddie"" Sorry for all the """" She is a fine actress. But her role was very confusing. She plays a guy. Everyone says she is a guy. But she is clearly a woman that is trying so hard to have a deep voice. I was waiting for the big reveal and thought it was part of the story line. But it wasn't. The hollyweird game that everyone plays along with is just so strange."
0	"I'm halfway to the series and just downed on me that I do not like any of the characters that the writers intended me to like and like the ones that are portraied as anti heroes, eg Wade.It seems to me that this is a caricature of a world born of a Hollywood eco chamber, where the good isn't not good enough, and needs amendments. I cannot and wouldn't identify with any of the main characters.The ""police"" if forcefully made into semi anti heroes by the main characters, while the main characters are a bunch of whiny spoiled brats, that would rather complain about the issues and do nothing about it, because why not..."
1	Up until season 5/6 I would have given 10 stars, then it got worse and season 8 was a complete disaster. I'm ending with an average of 7.
0	I have read the whole series of books and watched the movies.My review is not a criticism of the actors.I also understand that there's a lienency with following the book.However, how is a 50 year old going to pose as a 30 year old?Otherwise, is Tom supposed to be this much older for this limited series?Even if he is, is CGI going to help make him younger?Please don't get me wrong. I am only on episode two. I am still struggling with the age difference.Also finding things bland. I try to understand the new concept but it's rather boring. Why?Don't know if they are going to leave out the homosexual aspect (Malkovich) but I can only hope they try to somewhat follow the real character.
2	"Haven't experienced such a high quality series for quite a while. Attention to detail is remarkable! This one is going to win a lot of awards, for sure!! The characters are carefully developed and acted out brilliantly by each and every actor, without exception. The translation/flow from Italian to English is seamless; rare for any film or TV series. Have always marvelled at the rich cultural heritage in art and architecture that Italy has offered to world and this is showcased wonderfully in this series. This one surpasses the original ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" film, again a rare occurrence. What's next for this brilliant director? Can't wait!!"
1	Nathan Fillion carries this show but his talent is lost here. The rest of the cast do their best to make something out of a script that wildly swings from drama, to comedy, to out right parody. Not only do this shows name get inaccurate pretty quickly. But looses some of its charm when the Rookie races through his traning and end up being the most effective cop in the history of the LAPD. At times this show is entertaining but its quality remains very uneven. The Rookie struggles to find its own identity. I would love to see what this cast could do on a show that would have a better script. At the time of writing this review the 5th season is running, and have been green lighted for a 6th. I will not be following that far.
1	A bad ending is like u have been eating a sandwich and at the last bit u found a dead cockroach
2	I've had 3 Body Problem on my reading list for about three years but have been reading other books and down prioritised it. This is no longer the case after watching this first season, that is somewhere between a 8 and a 9 for me.The back story is brilliant and very innovative, at least for me and I have read and seen my share of sci-fi. I was very disturbed by the fact that D&D were doing this but in hindsight, they did a very good job with Game of Thrones when they had source material (i.e the first 4-5 seasons) but far from good without source material. If they just keep to the books and end this in 3 seasons they will be redeeming themselves a bit from the GoT (season 6-8 (especially 8))disaster.I very much look forward for reading the books this summer and the second season.
1	Very sad that such a tremendous series has ended in such an illogical, unenjoyable, lackluster way. What a let down for the fans who have been avidly following this show for so many years. I'm still shaking my head in disbelief.
1	"There are many aspects about this series that I love. The cinematography is beautiful. The choice for B&W works. Others complained about the pacing, but I liked it. It's a great looking show and well written.There are however a lot of things that irritated me. For one, the casting of Andrew Scott as Ripley. He is too old for the role. And he made the character seem unintelligent and charmless. Why would Dickie and Marge be his friend? Why would they invite him anywhere? Both Dickie and Ripley lacked a certain mid-century, classic ""American-ness"" in their roles for obvious reasons.The casting of Freddie felt a bit off for me as well.Overall, I thought it was a good effort. But just a bit flat. Beautiful but flat."
0	"I gave this a 2 out of 10 because everything I saw was fantastic. The first episode was incredible and true to source material while being its own story at the same time. And then my experience with the ""2nd"" episode was also very good even tho something seemed off. It was at 41 minutes into the ""2nd"" episode that I checked and realized it was playing episode 8. At this point the whole story was spoiled for me and watching the show was completely pointless. I was incredibly disappointed with this being the case because everything I had viewed was fantastic but also ruined the whole series for me. I'm sure if I was able to see the whole show my rating would be an 8/10 but I have the worst taste left in my mouth left for the show after my experience. Just to feel invested in this season or a possible season 2 I need to sit through hours of spoiled frustration."
1	...but they killed off the best actor in episode nine. Mariko really carried the show. Meanwhile the Blackthorne actor was the absolute worst. I'm sure they made him look even weaker when compared to the strong Japanese cast. And I do think episodes seven through nine dragged on a little too long. Too much focus on the ancillary characters rather than moving ahead on the plans to defeat the Council of Regents. And let me say it again, Mariko and the actor that portrayed her should have been alive at the end. Just a sorry way to end an otherwise interesting and well played series. Also, contributes to the history of Japan albeit in a fictional context.
1	I feel like I wasted my time on this show. Nothing gets answered in the end of the show and so many plot holes. Season 8 is the worst season I've ever seen on TV. Seriously, don't waste your time. Read the books and save yourself the disappointment.
1	As a long time Fallout fan, I was really looking forward to this show. Having seen all of it now, I'm not really disappointed, but let down. If you've never played any of the games, I think this show will be of great interest to anyone who likes science fiction. But for those of us who are dedicated fans (hundreds of hours in 3 and New Vegas, and thousands of hours in 4,) this show will miss the mark. But really only slightly. Everything you'd expect to be in this show is here, but the tone is off. Everyone is very happy-go-lucky for too long into the season. And serious moments are always cut with some sort of humor. I would encourage everyone to watch and judge for themselves, but go in with tempered expectations.
2	Awesome series as mentioned by other reviewers. But for me, spoilt by the frequent blurry backgrounds and bottom of screen. I understand this is because of the specific camera lens that they have used. For me it was far too distracting. In one scene, the corners of the screen are curved like CCTV footage!!Apart from the spoilt visuals, the story is very gripping with great characters, a little bit like Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai.Definitely worth watching and one of the best series I have seen. Can't wait for the next series!I'm not sure why they used those lenses to film this, there are online posts that go into it.
2	"1) Cinematic, multimillion dollar special effects, CGI, set design, production valuesThe visual effects for a TV show are absolutely phenomenal. Usually, you will experience them with the dragons and along the primary female protagonist, Daenerys Targaryan's journey, or in the truly epic battle scenes that can hold their own with the best modern movies that have battlefield scenes.2) Maise Williams- As the series goes on, she becomes the standout ""star"" of the show. It is both unexpected and ironic to watch her develop as just a side character into a movie star. Not sure which direction her career will go after this, or if parts like this will ever emerge again, but it's hard not to fall in love with her character and story.3) Daenerys Targaryan- Similarly to Maise's Arya, Emilia Clarke's Danaerys' journey from oppressed teenager sold into marriage to a barbarian to discovering her dragon power and then realizing her potential as a freer of slaves, breaker of chains, and heroine as she battles villains, backstabbers, and enemies while making friends and raising her dragons in hopes to rule the Iron Throne is imo the best storyline in the show, about tied with Arya's. Dany's story is an adventure through the eastern hemisphere of Westeros as she gains wisdom and worldliness from her intuition and advisors, with the primary advisor being Mormont.4) Battle Scenes and Shocking Twists combined. The famous battle scenes and shocking twists are worth the watch alone, even if they are viewed independently. They would give any newcomer to the show an idea of why the show is so famous and would probably entice them to give it a watch. Of course, for context, the show should be viewed from the beginning, but these are must sees for all movie or television fans.5) Competent and above average writing and acting for a TV series throughout. It's not on Breaking Bad's level of writing, but it has its moments and is almost up there, and the acting as a whole is above average for television.Overall, Game of Thrones is an excellent television show. It ultimately received lots of criticism for its 8th season, but it wasn't all bad, just disappointing. The show is still better than other popular shows of the decade or two, shows like Dexter, Walking Dead, Mad Men, Sons of Anarchy, and the Wire. It is in a genre of its own (fantasy/war/adventure) so it is hard to compare with the great dramas. It is the best show of its genre and just below Breaking Bad on the list. They are the two best shows of their genres.The primary issues with the show arose in the final 2 seasons, and yes, at times it really was ""that"" bad and criticism was warranted. From heavy cheesy dialogue to laughable plot armor to butchering character arcs and storylines by ignoring all that preceded the information given for six to seven seasons before it, to diminishing the scenes time and lines of the show's best villains and characters, to arguably making a parody of the ending, to an abundance of illogical and nonsensical story events, and at critical times coming off as like a bad soap opera written by teenagers.8/10"
0	"3 Body Problem (3/21/24, scifi, 8 eps, 1-hr, Netflix) This is the much anticipated tv adaptation of the fabled book series. But let me cut to the chase since this was a serious disappointment for me and apparently many, many others. I only made it through two eps before calling time of death. First, though it's largely written by the GoT duo - D&D - this is a very boring, dry, and just dumb adaptation. I'm tired of ""legends"" insulting my intelligence by spewing forth trash though it's lined with Netflix's gold. There were legit stupid, nonsensical plot points in the first two eps and I just won't tolerate that. Add to that all the excessive - stupid - cigarette smoking and them calling the headset thing a game when it's clearly a simulation at the least. Just unforgiveable stuff. Fail."
1	...it wasn't presented to me in 4K HDR and yet I found the imagery much more enthralling.It was translated, subtitled, and spent much more time explaining science and engineering concepts, and yet I found the dialogue much less insulting.It didn't have Eiza Gonzalez, but also, it didn't have Eiza Gonzalez. (picking on Eiza as a famous name here, but in general I found the show to be miscast).It can't be binge-watched (or you will likely find it too long), but in trade you are really able to understand the characters and their motivations.It does a much better job in creating mystery and suspense and the action scenes are much better.Although the 3-body story clearly takes liberties in imagining the bounds based on current modern science, this is really what makes it great and I feel like the roots in real science were lost in the Netflix version. The Tencent version did a good job in presenting a story that is beautiful, interesting, at times exciting, but also seemingly very authentic.While the Tencent version did seem a little long to me, I think society (including myself) needs to keep some practice at having the patience to enjoy something that is not always fast moving with over-emotional characters, simple dialogue, and instant gratification.
0	"I don't play video games, so the trailer had me expecting an dystopian thriller with a satirical edge, perhaps along the lines of Robocop. And the sheer number of 10/10 reviews, right here, calling it ""phenomenal,"" ""clever"", ""mind-blowing,"" etc., sure had me stoked...I was not expecting slapstick.Be warned: Fallout is the ""Dumb & Dumber"" of apocalyptic series. In fact, that's far too kind. Fallout is the ""Dumb & Dumber To"" of apocalyptic series. It is all gags, relentlessly, and about 1 in 9 land.The characters use bottle-caps for currency, love Jell-o cake, enjoy having their codpieces polished, and sometimes have great-uncles who are amphibians.""Clever,"" remember.The attempts at satire are so nonstop, the jokes so never-ending, that it makes Rick & Morty feels like a drama. I'm not being hyperbolic. Episode 1 of Fallout starts out like a thriller with layers of dark comedy, but ""thriller"" and ""dark"" are dropped entirely by Episode Two. It's just zany, goofy low-stakes gore and potty humor after that.""You had your finger hacked off?"" Asks a crazed robot-doctor. ""There! I've given you a brand new finger! Now I'm going to harvest your organs!"" (That scene actually happens.)I do enjoy idiotic TV, as much as the next guy... I just prefer to know what I'm buying into, ahead of time. This show is complete idiocy, by design, and that's fine... My review is only to warn you that this is nothing in the vein of, say, The Last Of Us or Silo. There is no drama, there is no darkness, and there are no thrills to be had.Just jokes. One after the other. Infinitely.On the technical side: A major fight between an Iron Man and a zombie gunslinger, in Episode Two, is filmed with the skill of Godzilla vs. Megalon. (By the lesser of the Nolan Brothers, apparently). If they were aiming for Monty Python, I guess they nailed it.So, 4 stars, since this is probably intended for people who laugh at farts, and they're obviously thrilled about it."
1	GOT used to be so good in its early seasons, but now that the final season is over, we should rejudge the whole show in a different light.Undisputedly, the first four seasons of GOT are simply the best. They successfully changed and redefined the whole fantasy genre since Tolkien's inception of Middle Earth. Their legacy would be enshrined in pop culture for decades to come.But the final few seasons have gone downhill since the show run out of the original source materials, and eventually turned in to a pile of irredeemable garbage. All the character arcs ruined, all the plot developments abandoned, and all the world settings ignored. The ignorance and arrogance of David Benioff and D. B. Weiss are directly responsible for the downfall of GOT and these two incompetent buffoons must be stopped before they get their dirty hands on the Star Wars franchise. Fandoms of the world, Unite ! before it's too late.
2	Nathan Fillion does an amazing job as always. This show starts out a little rough but it gets great. Its a dramatic awesome show that somehow manages to keep things light and fun. I hope it goes on for several seasons. Its one of the best cop shows I've seen. Most cop shows are take themselves to seriously. This feels very real.
2	I wish lots of characters weren't gone, but glad that some are. Large cast always makes way for some bad stories, but there are too many good ones to not love the show. Ellen Pompeo is wonderful and so happy she stuck with the show so long. It's delightful to see an actress stuck with a show.
2	Season 1-5 is outstanding. Season 6 is good. Season 7 was not great but also not terrible. Season 8 was quit terrible and probably ruined the long term reputation for the series unfortunately.
2	"Hello all, Let me be clear, first it's not my own choice to watch the first episode in 2005, I was just end- watching the series ""Prison Break"" when I first met ""Grey's anatomy"",and as an advice from a friend, I bought the series, and do you realize , In one day I watched the whole series which was about 5 episodes.Iam not a physician, Iam only an administrator in medical section in a hospital, and all the terminology of medicine are familiar to me, to brief, the show hooked me, I watched tell now the all 12 series from the early 2005, its amazing, charming,its the series to be interested in, billions of emotions are there, from A to Z , love and friendship and gay-gay relations are there, every event or Holiaday is a story, it needs a lots of emotions to be there, go for it, you will love, adore ,admire this show, it deserves every piny, the writer Shonda Rhymes is a natural gifted writer, a genius ... I love her and this show is great and produced for great minds..Enjoy!!!"
1	To the producers: THE STORY MATTERS, THE DIALOGS MATTER, THE PLOTHOLES MATTER, THE NONSENSE MATTERS, THE RUSHING MATTERS. IN THREE WORDS: THE WRITING MATTERS. It's not only about the visuals, for f's sake. That should only account for 10-20% of the value of the series. So disappointed that the rest 80-90% has been thrown drown the drain. SHAME...
0	"This show is so LAME. Why don't they just call this show ""Horny People Who are Mainly Always Trying to have Sex with Co-Workers, while Pretending to be Wanna-be Doctors"". Guess that title would be too long, eh ? This show was better when it was called MELROSE PLACE !! Quit pretending to be a Hospital drama, and go back to being a cheesy Ad Agency or some other ""believable"" work place setting, where your characters don't really have to pretend to be smart, and deep, and human, and caring, and thoughtful, etc etc etc. Just make them ENTERTAINING !! This show is trying to be a cross of ER and MELROSE PLACE. It's not working."
2	"Baby Reindeer is Netflix's gripping new 8-part series that follows the bizarre and unsettling real-life interactions between a stalker and comedian Richard Gadd, whose character is named Donny. Through intimate, beautifully poetic monologues written and spoken by Richard Gadd himself, and unsettling encounters with Martha, played by Jessica Gunning, it delves deep into the psyche of both predator and prey, leaving viewers both disturbed and captivated. Baby Reindeer reveals the chilling complexities of desire, validation, and obsession, whilst exploring the intricate dynamics of infatuation and manipulation, whether it's platonic, romantic, or professional.The show begins lighthearted and funny, but then descends into darkness, portraying experiences of grooming, sexual assault and rape. Whilst many scenes were incredibly hard and distressing to watch, others were eye-wateringly honest and open. Hauntingly portrayed is a subconscious coping mechanism, where after sexual assault the abused may begin to sexualise the violence experienced, reclaiming its power or replaying the moments in hopes to understand what and how transpired in a guilt inducing confusion, which I have not yet seen play out in another TV show or film so sensitivly or honestly.Donny's self-destructive aftermath and the craving for approval, even from the abuser, only fed his insecurities. The desperate need for validation and the frequent threads of pity are palpable throughout, intertwined with the importance of parental acceptance and support. As the series progresses, it becomes a harrowing tale of two individuals grappling with their own demons and desperately seeking healing amidst a tumultuous journey of obsession and madness.Donny's struggle with following his dreams of fame as a comedian is enough to send someone into a spiral, as he faced failure repetitively. This greatly reflects the fluctuation of highs and lows in so called 'unconventional careers'. I found the scene where Donny bares his soul in a tearful confession in episode 7 to be very cleverly introduced. In an earlier episode, his comedy sets within the Edinburgh Fringe Festival open with a loud (both in volume and fashion), flamboyant, full of energy entrance, with music and hip thrusting, he then abruptly stops and leads with ""my mum died today"". This style of juxtaposition comedy bled into real life, as in the penultimate episode Donny breaks down on stage sharing all of the awful experiences and stress he has endured. As the crowd sits in an awkward silence, he then plays his jingle about condoms and popadoms on a noise maker, and then leaves the stage. The set became him and swallowed him whole.Jessica Gunning's ability to unravel on screen was utterly impressive, and I was conflicted with seeing her as the villain when so clearly troubled and unwell. Richard Gadd's genuine vulnerability and bravery within Baby Reindeer is an unforgettable performance, and even more so knowing that these are his life experiences and own words.In the end, I believe Martha and Donny share many similarities, whether Donny would like to admit it or not. They start out both as dreamers, lost in their imaginations and aspirations for the future. They are ceaseless when it comes to something they love and yearn for, for Donny appreciation and comedy, and for Martha, appreciation and Donny. Martha noticed his pain, which he recognises when he said ""Martha saw me the way I wanted to be seen"". And Donny saw hers, even if in the form of a free cup of tea. They also relate in their fears, and in their depths of obsession. Her infatuation overcame him and he too was soon obsessed. Even when in prison, her shadow lingered at the bus stop or in the answer phone messages which still flooded his ears.""Baby Reindeer"" is a compelling and thought-provoking exploration of trauma, desire, and the complexities of human connection. In the end, they were just 2 people desperately struggling to heal."
0	Many fine actors in this series. I would once give it high ratings but in 2021 the writing has become gawd awful with its pre-occupation with preaching at us rather than entertaining us with stories of what police officers (including black, asian and female officers) can and do accomplish everyday on the job.
0	Game of Thrones does for medieval fantasy what Deadwood did for westerns. And like Deadwood Game of Thrones amps up the viciousness but this time to a ridiculous degree. The acting is terrific. The set design (cgi or not), costumes, directing, editing and sound are all top notch. The dialogue can be cutting and clever but also arch and melodramatic. The desperate and menacing and oh so important conversations frankly started to blur together in my head. Just when your attention might wander breasts or a new extreme in atrocities is served to remind you how cool and hardcore this world is. After a while I started to wonder how anyone is still alive in this world. Where does all this fodder come from? But for sure thousands of lives will be readily available for extinguishing next time the audience might be getting bored or needs to be reminded how nasty somebody is.
0	This is a classic progression in a television series. Start with something people enjoy. Now start messing with what works. Get back to the basic story line. Get rid of the totally irritating music it doesn't fit and it's to loud. On the plus side if it doesn't improve I'll have more free time.
2	I get that people in Japan slurp their drinks, but there's no need to play constant slurping every minute to convey that to a U. S. demographic. Everytime someone is eating, you'll hear slurp slurp slurp slurp. It's gross and adds nothing to the story. If you can get past that, it's a great and gripping show.

1	I loved grey's anatomy! And for me until season 9-10 it was watchable. After that, I came across an episode of 15 season and apart from Meredith Grey -who is really a supporting role now- I maybe knew 1-2 actors. All the cast is replaced, it is a totally different show with the same name and repetitive storyline. I mean why take such a wonderful series and make it this distasteful thing that nobody watches any more?? You earned quite a lot of money and you dragged it so much that in the end I thing it's gonna be cancelled...
0	"(UPDATE: I am leaving my original negative review for this series below, but adding this preface since I just watched the first two episodes of the original Chinese series, which is already much better. In the 2nd episode of the Chinese version they go into a detailed metaphor of ""physics is broken"" using a pool table. Now I get what's missing in the Netflix version: this show is supposed to be about the science. The way the new US series abbreviates those elements takes away the most important part of the show. That's why I gave is the bad review below.)Since I watched the whole series I feel compelled to write a review. This is either a bad adaptation of a good book or an accurate adaptation of a bad book. I don't know since I never read it. But after an intriguing first 3 episodes the story becomes full of holes and strained attempts at emotional moments. The characters seemed plastic neo-generic caricatures. What should have been huge dramatic moments felt rushed. I mean, the night sky blinks on and off and somehow the world goes back to normal after a few days? I dunno. There was no scope to this story. It should have been longer and had a wider societal breadth. There must be something from the novel they didn't capture because there were a lot of unexplained cryptic exchanges... especially in the joke that Ye tells Saul. I was waiting for that to take on some relevance in the story but... nope. I have a feeling it was cryptic information on how to fight the aliens...? Maybe it's explained in season 2... if there is one? Otherwise, why all focus on that story? And the subplot about the man who was dying of cancer...? They kept trying to create these moving moments but failing, imo. I didn't care what happened to the guy. So they sent his brain into space so the aliens could clone him... maybe? It just doesn't make any sense. And whoever wrote that scene where they use the nanofibers to slice up the ship doesn't understand anything about the Panama Canal. The ships have to move into locks where the water level is changed. There are hundreds of way they could have secured that ship while it was in a lock. It just seemed like such an over the top way to get the disc. I continued watching mainly because I was genuinely curious to see where it would all wind up. But I must admit it was almost as big a let down as the end of season 1 of ""From"". In the end it's just another story about aliens coming to take our stuff. And that just seems so old school now. While it wasn't awful it was a little plastic to me."
1	Season 1 -5 was awesome , season 6 was good, season 7 was ok but season 8 is a total Disappointment, so lets focus on season 8, the acting was good like always, I find no fault in any of the actors, but the directors and the story writers really dropped the ball and ruined a what was going to be a hall of fame series, as I make this review their is one episode left , Hoping they redeem themselves even a little but I dough it , season 8 is a train wreck even more then Lost, Its very said and upsetting when I think about how I have watched this show loyally for 8 years and to be let down with total garbage writing like this, Maybe they just didn't care at all because the series was ending , it sure seems so, in short season 8 Writers go from Hero to 0, but by all means watch it so you can see for yourself how they Killed this series in the last season , it will make you scratch your head and wonder like I am
1	First two episodes are confusing but in an good way. Show builds op strong for me. Episode 3, 4 and 5 very strong.But then, from like episode 5 the focus shifts to the most annoying character i have witnessed in a long time: Auggie.I dont know if it is a bad actress or a good one and Auggie is ment to be this annoying but is a very hard watch.At some point you just want to skip every scene she is in. I have still one episode left and my god i hope the character is written off.So now I have 98 words left to typ but i just wanded to express my hate for this character nothing more. Finished.
1	"I'll be very brief. This show is the equivalent of cheap booze with whiskey aromaIf you're in bar drinking low quality spirits, and here comes that counterfeit drink that has some Macallan aroma you'll clearly drink that for the rest of the night.This is this show, if you're seeing the ideas for the first time, you'll be: ""yeah decent, 8/10"" because the 'cool beats' are all straight up ripped from the books.""But hey dear reviewer, this is an adaptation, what nonsense are you spilling, ofc they have books 'stuff' ""Well sure, but almost everything that should've been original about this show is of a poor quality and the book stuff is a downgrade.I'm sorry but rewatch this show and you'll quickly realise that the dialogue is unnatural, that's not how friends talk, the interpersonal relationships this show tries to build are not natural. The plot itself doesn't make sense.In the books, the 'power levels' of 'something' (to avoid spoilers) are toned down. Here they are cranked to 11 which makes the story the show tries to tell absolutely not fit with the book story, yet the show desperately has to dumb down or 'guess X forgot' to make the story fit.Why 6? Because the crew, VFX, cinematography, all the auxiliary stuff is all there. Heck, even a lot of actors are doing their job mighty fine. But those all things that you can buy with money and are pretty standardized nowadays.And with the books as a spinal cord, it makes it an above average show (above 5/10 - that's what average means ... )"
1	The main problem is how hammy the authors are when showing all the on-the-agenda problems - with more subtlety it could be much more watchable and the characters won't be saying or doing things they normally wouldn't.
2	Most 1-4 star reviews are the book warriors. They claim that's its poorly adapted etc. I mean, it is not a classic, so who cares? The story is very entertaining. So I personally clearly recommend not to listen to these reviews. Since it is actually a really good series. Building up nice excitement and holding it till the end. Not a fan of each character to be honest. But even some annoying folks cannot harm the spirit of this series. And it is not a happy Disney story, oh no, don't worry. Some moments are truly shocking. And not so far away as other science fiction. Leaving you back with real awkwardness and what if moments.Enjoyed every minute of the show.
1	No Castle, but watchable. Nathan looks like a wimp in this series.
2	The Netflix series 3 BODY PROBLEM is in my opinion the most significant Science Fiction work to come life on screen since Arthur C. Clarke's 2001 A Space Odyssey. Behind the cinematic production we find the team that created GAME OF THRONES. The series may seem confusing at first but hang in there, once the core precepts become clear to you the revelation of the fresh thinking going on here will make you feel like a pioneer, as great science fiction should. If you miss watching this you are likely to miss a critically important next step in the development of human consciousness. This is an important work that prepares human consciousness for the progression of the stellar expansion of human civilisation from where we are now, to the next steps.
0	I get that you have to make some adaptations to turn a book series into a TV series. I really do. But they honestly killed the thing that made this science fiction work really shine, which was the science.The little things, like a physicist jumping into a comically large, horribly computer-animated, water Cherenkov detector (and it's not super k, it's in England for some reason?) really draw you out of everything. Or the stupid monkey who is thawed from cryogenic temperature in 4 seconds. Or making the stars blink instead of the CMB. Or what is this huge accelerator at Oxford? Or the aliens just transmitting Chinese with no further explanation how.I don't feel like the writers are treating me as a thinking adult, but as a child, passively watching in the background with my phone in one hand and a bag of Cheetos in the other.The source material deserved better.
1	If you're familiar with the books this series is based on, and you were able to at least get through the first book (The Three-Body Problem), then there's a good chance you liked that book but won't enjoy this Netflix series. I say this because reading that book can be challenging, not because it's boring or uninteresting, but because the story is so science-heavy and the otherworldly concepts so overwhelming. The most interesting character in the story is Je Wenjie, the link between the past and present and well presented in this TV adaptation. Then there's Wang Miao, a nanotechnology professor and the single protagonist driving most of the story in present day China. Benioff, Weiss (and Netflix) decided to turn this single protagonist into the circle of friends you see in the show, living in present day London. There's a lot of tension, anxiety and paranoia in the book, as the single protagonist, along with detective Shi Qiang, try to figure all these stuff out--it's a lot like reading a Philip K Dick short story. Unfortunately, all this is lost in the TV adaptation. The show creators decided to water everything down for a wider audience by diluting the story concepts and rearranging some of the characters and events. Yes, there's more character depth in this Netflix adaptation, but they often distract from the story rather than driving it. The characters added to the show weren't structured well enough for the story to make sense. What makes the book grandiose and intellectually challenging--from figuring out the three-body phenomena in the virtual game, to the ingenuity aliens and humans use to manipulate or one-up one another--is kind of lost here. You want your audience to figure things out along with the characters, not random characters revealing major plot points for the general audience. Most of the spectacle, secondary characters and major story points are presented well, so if you haven't read the books, this adaptation is probably worth a watch.
0	I admit I have watched every episode since the very beginning, but that's because I have OCD.What are you doing ? This show should have ended after that insane plane crash.Ellen Pompeo! Lady, you are now officially pathetic!It is painful to watch. It gets more absurd by the minute.... I'm sure The Bold and The Beautiful makes more sense and is easier to watch.Please, release the otherwise good actors and set them free....
1	Woudl've given it a higher score but really can't stand the annoying music and slow motion, why can't they just fight without the stupid music and slow motion ? Other than those, it's a pretty enjoyable series so far.

0	"Put this show out of its misery. It has been terrible for seasons and seasons back, and now they are heavily exploiting covid crisis in the last season, which is unforgivable. You are cashing on epidemics and global misery? Seriously? How is this abomination of show still on? It used to be kinda fun and spicy sometimes, which is the only reason I gave it 3 stars. Now it's just awful, dull, boring and cringey as hell. I wasn't the biggest fan to begin with but at least it used to have some qualities in first seasons. No wonder so many ""doctors"" got killed because actors desperately wanted to leave this sinking ship.Interestingly enough, nurses in this hospital do not exist. Doctors do everything, because who needs nurses, right? And apparently no one has life or love outside of freaking hospital. They all slept with each other but with no one who does not work with them. Peculiar, isn't it. And they are under constant 24hour stress. No human being would survive all that stress and abuse and still have full make up and great hairstyle with peachy skin. One doctor is in coma and she still has perfect hair!And Meredith, the main character has such horribly bad luck in life it's bizarre. After almost 20 seasons it's enough. The latest beach visions are just bizarre, especially with visions of people who died at much much younger age than they look in visions. They aged after death? Who thinks of this crap?"
2	I see lot of reviews on the flaws in the adaptation. I havent read the book so cant comment. If I have to assume there is no book and its just a show, its very entertaining. It kept me hooked through all the episodes. The visual effects were fantastic. The acting is very good and story keeps good pace. The only disappointment is, that I have to watch future seasons to see how it ends.The most appealing part are the religious connotations which you notice, if you watch carefully. Assuming that a higher unknown power will be benevolent and solve all your problems. Killing an unknown person for a leader or entity you don't even know exists or will meet.Quite looking forward to the next season.
2	The first season started wonderful out of the box cop show at first solid characters good old fashioned cops like bradford and the captain but after season 3 it started to feel like a social lesson about the racism in America and in the lapd. I mean I get it there is still issues about this but come on! Not everything supposed to be lessons every show that I watch started to feel like the same they cut the edges of the bradford the cops are now more in to the black community. Some cops became gay out of the blue there are some racist cops out there and the show is not about the rookie now. It's very interesting topic and you need the get back to the season 1 😏
2	It's easy to be a pessimist in film and tv now in days. I'm not different. I had zero hope in this series, but it truly does deliver. I am already watching it again. Where there are some questions of lore accuracy and the somewhat shoe horned romance doesn't feel necessary, it is just fun. I had fun watching it and truly love the use of practical effects when done. I do hope they keep steering in that direction, but just watch. I had a good time both times!It keeps the whimsy of the wasteland while having the grim aspects. I do wish the world was a little bigger? I think of the towns in fallout games vs the show, it does feel rather baron.
1	Im a hardcore Fallout fan and have played through all fallouts from Fallout 3 forwards, and couldn't stick watching past the pilot ep.The show looks visually cool, but everything else is bland and expectable. All characters except the cowboy ghoul are unrelatable and annoying. The dialogue is bland and does not grasp your attention at all. Most actors are neverheard nobodys and don't bring anything cool to the table. The music score is overused, modern scifi-style drone stuff and does not fit into the setting. Wacky and uncomfortable humor kinda breaks the immersion. Most jarring thing is that every scene makes the whole thing feel like a Disney movie made for kids. Every bad guy with evil intentions can be sensed from mile away and character actions in fight scenes are over the top madness. Aside from the ghoul, the pilot episode lacked any sense of seriousness which I was expecting considering the gritty post-apocalyptic fallout setting.If you see yourself as a serious Fallout fan, I do not recommend watching this. If you have not played the games and are interested, maybe give it a try. Anyway, the best you'll be getting is a mediocre show with bland dialogue, uninteresting characters and predictable plot. Not worth my time IMO.
2	I admit I have a soft spot for private detective drama's whatever the time frame and this looks to be a good one. The genre relies on a strong male lead with some kind of vulnerability and Colin Farrell as Sugar completely embodies the requirement. All the cool you expect from the genre is on display, the car, the suits, the neon, every box ticked. The plot conforms to all the requirements, wealthy man hires private eye to find granddaughter, money is no object, all is not as it seems, dark secrets, etc. The directorial style and cinematography really lift this piece and the referencing to classic noir enhances the look. We're only two episodes in so it could go badly off the rails but as I say, if the reviewer at The Guardian hates it then it is going to be good.
2	Fallout mainly takes place more than 200 years in the future after what was apparently an all-out nuclear war in the 1950's. There are several extended flashbacks to events in the 1950's leading to the nuclear apocalypse. The post-apocalypse world is quite complicated with several different factions and groups competing with each other. Some characters have managed to survive the entire 200 year period from the initial apocalypse to the present time of the show. There are many great songs from the 50's and 60's in the show. Two of the main characters, Lucy and Maximus, are absolutely delightful and often very funny. There are many very funny scenes and dialogue here. In addition, the show is well-plotted with many mysteries that are gradually unraveled. The final show of the first season leaves open several plot questions, so hopefully we can look forward to another season or two. The only negatives are that the physical appearance of the ghouls is horrifying and disgusting. The other negative is too many gun battles with people getting their heads blown off and etc.
0	I really liked the first two seasons but season three is only agenda tv. I'm a groven adult and i don't need, again and again political teachings in a tv show.
0	The first season of the show was okay. Great medical drama and some fun personal life issues thrown in. Then in season 2 it all fell down. Huge feminist statements about how women can have sex with anyone they meet who gives them a drink, but of course only if they're McGorgeous.And then apparently interns can get away with killing patients without any repercussions whatsoever.Could have been a great show. Thankfully there's House MD to watch.
0	Since the Ben's spin off Station 19 came on the scene, Grey's has nosedived. Lots of contrived plots to bring Station 19 Cast members into the show, dreadful!
2	The firs three seasons are great, then the show declines. I stopped with the fifth season.Generally - solid acting, good music/soundtracks, descent plot.
0	If you find mono-dimensional characters and campy acting interesting, this show is for you.
1	"Greys anatomy is an interesting show, because even in its ""grace period"" it is a flawed, often overly sentimental and whiny show, which focuses on some of the most insufferable, selfish and insecure surgeons on TV. One of the couples in this show luterlaly start talking about their relationship issues DURING OPERATION. LIKE?????. But hey aside from that, Grey's anatomy is an often intricate character study which looks at human relationships in an imperfect but sort of beautiful way. Mostly good performances, and well paced seasons that do tend to suffer from tropes and repetitive episode structures. But within this repetitive formula lies an interesting episode which further challenges its characters and takes them through an almost naturalistic journey. Still. It's very annoying."
2	I want to give it a ten.. Because I immensely enjoyed the whole show except the last few episodes.. Me the viewer felt embarrassed watching it because it felt like I was a guest at a dinner and the food was delicious I was taking my time eating it.. And before dessert the host was giving vague hints that I should leave and wouldn't explain me the reason why... Overall I truly enjoyed what I ate.
0	Perfect for anybody, who never read the book. Missing very important parts from story, what is badly going sideway from the original, simple making everything chaotic and unclear... Many characters dies, who are actually very important part of the end of the (original) story. For this one, doesn't matter.The actors absolutely don't match with the characters, their plays and appears are just simple bad.Totally missing the relation between Toranaga and Blackthorne, what actually made the story interesting. I did not see any clear sign of Blackthorne's evolving, what is a basic of the story. Mixed up conversations and mixed up screens with absolutely different characters, than it should be... Only the view acceptable but that is all. In anything else, the old series from the 80's was ten times better... It was really a wasted 10 hours...
0	I had great hopes. I've watched Mr. Sanada acting in different movies and I admire his work. His performance in this one is very good, not his best in my opinion, but very good.Costumes are very nice too. I cannot speak about their authenticity though I don't remember seeing any obi on almost any female character. Not on this remake. I've seen it on all female characters on the 1980 original version.There aren't other good things I can write about it.I read this remake was well received and rated in Japan, compared with the original version which was not. I'm not Japanese and although I watched a lot of Japanese movies, not only the ones made for western viewers, and I read a lot about Japan and its culture, I think this version was made to target both, the eastern and western audiences. The team probably worked hard to do that and I think it shows. While the original version is somewhat cheesy, this one lacks almost any sentiment. It's like the Japanese part of the team had an argument with the western team every time they may have tried to do something to bring any soul to the story. I felt a tension throughout the whole series. It felt restrained and cold. I believe that may have been the intention, more so since they filmed it on rainy, cold, and dark days.The screenplay misses key points from the book, and most of the ones they didn't miss are minimized. I know, it's based on James Clavell's book, not quite loosely, but still, not what the author intended. That is sometimes not bad, that is when the book is not that great, just the idea behind it is. It's not the case with this novel. I don't expect for a team to follow the book exactly, but at least do an acceptable job, if they cannot do better. There really cases in which the movie is better than the book. Not in this case.I think Clavell knew a lot about Japan and its culture. To this point he writes about kissing which is not the way a samurai male or female was showing affection to his/her spouse or lover. In this movie the Blackthorne kissing Mariko scene is a fail. There are ways actors can show love even without touching, but I haven't seen any such scene in this new series. Almost all seppuku scenes in the movie are empty compared to the way they are portrayed in the novel. There is at least one which is better represented in the movie but which is not in the book. Toda Hiromatsu is never committing seppuku but the scene in the movie is very good.The screenplays for different episodes are written by different people and directed by different directors. This is why the whole story is missing unity. It's almost like threads that barely connect.I watched all episodes, some even twice. Overall it's not that bad but for me it was disappointing. I did not enjoy the original much at the time I've seen it in 1980. Not because I read the book previously. Even so, I like it better than this new one. I would not call this new one a remake.
2	OK so the show is called greys anatomy and the question i ask is... where is she.... i don't know... i was sitting at home thinking about this show that i will watch until it ends... and i was going through all the good arks in the show.... 3 part merr drowning.... bomb in the hospital... ooof i did love that... but when i went through my best episodes... i have to say.. non of them were from this season or the last....i get that Ellen was pregnant and had less of a role, but when she was in it, she had one liners and i really miss her... i loved the show when i first came out... it was edgy and i remember when i bought the box set it said... BETTER THAN E.R. EVER WAS....... i feel bad saying this but its going down that path... the plot lines are made for anyone to follow so you can tune in and out when u feel like and it shouldn't be like that....where is Joe? and Joes bar? why ain't the gang down there having a go and being merry... the mercy west story had so much promise and was left go within a few weeks... i felt the show was going to go back to basics.. Seattle grace vs Mercy west... who is better.... well that was over in 2 weeks..if any of the producers are listening... listen up... I'm a fan so this is not a dig at you..... its called greys anatomy so lets see our girl... let something happen to her and lets see her dark and twisty...... and lets see a story that lasts more than 2 episodes.... its about the cast not the patients... they are just there for symbolism... come on guys.... seriously?
1	"Rewatching this legendary show is quite an experience. I would still recommend watching but, as another suggested, stop at season 6 episode 10 winds of winter and imagine your own ending - you'll be happier for it.Need a moment to debrief about all the injustices done to character development and story lines 1. The wolves who in the best seasons were used as perfect symbolism for house stark. Ghost, the only wolf remaining with the stark children, was abruptly given away by Jon in season 8?2. Cersei - the acting of this character was impeccable and the fact that she was made to drink wine and stare out a window for the last 2 seasons is a waste of a wonderful actress3. Still appalled by Bran's ""visions"" of Ned as a young lad. Cringe!4. The long night - I have no words5. ""No one has a better story than bran"". Actually everyone does. I did not read the books but I'm sure bran was not such a useless drag.6. There are so many more including danaerys who gave all the feels as khaleesi only to become a loony bimbo. Also Jon and yegriette are my favorite romance of the series . The character of Jon had great potential but instead was succumbed to a simple minded man repeating ""muh queen"" and ""I didn't want this"" over and over. SHAME.Still watch this show as season 1-4 are impeccable. It is an atrocity that this could have been next to breaking bad in being one of the greatest shows but instead turned into a ridiculous mess. I will never get over the sickening feeling about what could have been."
0	The last series is such a let down. I've lost sympathy for all the characters thanks to a terrible storyline. I couldn't care less who ends up on the throne
1	"I gave this show a chance after I saw multiple videos popping up on Youtube channels I watch occasionally claiming that the show was actually good. I didn't really watch through those videos as I didn't want to have the story spoiled and go in as unbiased as possible. My last Fallout game was Fallout 3 which was way over 10 years ago. So I have some experience with the source material but it's not recent.I watched through the first episode and was mildly entertained. The brutality and gore somewhat reflects what you see in the games as well with heads and limbs exploding or being severely injured. There's also several slow motion scenes similar to what the games do when you do the auto-aim functionality and target specific body parts.The world also looks like Fallout as far as I can tell. You have the post-apocalyptic wastelands with shabby settlements trying to survive. You have the raiders, brotherhood of steel and vaults. The outfits and backgrounds are accurate.The problems start when you look at the writing and characters though. A whole lot of it doesn't really make any sense and it only works if you as the viewer (as well as the characters) aren't actually asking very relevant questions. As soon as your mind starts working though and questions pop up about certain aspects the story completely falls apart. There are multiple factions and there are conflicts among them. Why these conflicts exist though - you'll get a shrug from me because I couldn't figure it out - especially in the last episode when the big showdown starts. The problem is also that way to many character in that one faction just go along with killing random people even though they are supposed to be kind of honorable and so on. It just doesn't make any sense.The season also has an open end leaving a lot of questions on the table for season 2. On one hand it can be good to have an overarching storyline throughout the seasons. On the other hand the ending of season 1 on its own is unsatisfying. So you either watch season 2 or you're left with a mess and that just doesn't deserve a high rating in my opinion.Finally something that also bothered me is that the pacing of the episodes was wildly jumping around. At times it slows to a snail pace with obvious filler content and then at other times it jumps around all over the place and a rapid pace. Especially in the last episode there was one character suddenly popping up in the middle of the battle zone and I was like ""wait, how did you get there unnoticed?"". It just feels off in many aspects resulting in sometimes being boring and then at others slightly overwhelmed with the events happening. There definitely is a lack of consistency here."
1	"I'll lay my cards on the table here in that I was a fan from my childhood of the original. I'd expected this to be even better. And whilst it starts off being a faithful remake of the original, it soon descends into something less enjoyable.The original focused exclusively on John Blackthorns's viewpoint becoming immersed in a foreign alien culture and becoming gradually absorbed by it. This one does also but to a lesser degree. About 75% of the show is looking at the feuding between the various clans. And I dispose that's about right because after all the show is called Shogun and not John Blackthorne' Adventures in Japan.But this creates a pretty significant problem - for me at least. 95% of the show is subtitled. So you spend most of the time reading the subtitles and not the characters. Now normally I don't have a problem with subtitles for foreign films but for this I do.Then there's the lighting. Why are so many scenes set in such poorly lit indoor settings? And they're not restricted to just indoors.Then there's the weather. Does it never stop raining in Japan? Living in Ireland I've cursed our foul damp weather my whole life but we're effectively Saharan compared to these poor souls.Finally, there's the whole ""They all look the same"" problem. Now don't jump down my throat with this one. But the fact is that to Caucasians, who also all look the same to other ethnicities, trying to determine which character is which is so difficult especilaly when the lighting is so poor. Other filmmakers get around this by using different hair colour or style for each character to differentiate them one from another. Or dress them differently consistently. But with these characters, where the blokes all sport the same partial baldy hair and the same outfits, you spend so much time confused as to who is who. And since there are so many extras all looking the same, I found myself watching an extra thinking it was a lead character and vice versa. Maybe that's just a problem for an old timer like me.I think the only time the outfit colour is implemented is with John's love-interest. She's generally sporting a pale blue outfit. Dear love you if she ever wishes to experiment with different outfit choices.So, is it an easy watch? No. You have to seriously invest your time into persevering with the show past the first two episodes. In fact there's one episode around the middle of the show that I think the filmmakers had a chuckle putting it in. We're treated to a traditional Japanese play and ""musical performance"" with accompanying dancers. And it goes on forever with little relevance or benefit to the plot.It certainly has many good points but I think it's very overrated. I was close to choosing Seppuku myself."
0	Grey's used to be my favorite show but now, I can't even watch it. For the past 4 seasons, it's lost its beauty with its cast and creativity. It's all about sex, politics and chit-chatting. Wheres is the medical drama that a MEDICAL DRAMA should have? They completely ruined relationships. Japril was endgame and they had to take that away, Jo and Alex where meant to be and things just don't make any sense. I would do anything to have the old 2012ish Grey's back.
0	I've watched Grey's from the beginning and I'm done. Where did the medical show go? Now it's clearly just a platform for their political agenda. Ridiculous.
0	This show had its merits on its own rights for so many seasons. Covid could have been an opportunity to keep this high level, at least, or even improve. Instead it has become a chaotic mixture of different genre story lines, the characters one-dimensional and lecturing the viewers with simplified political messages in premier plan. Using brainwashing techniques may strike back.
1	I've been binge-watching Grey's for the last few months and am now on Season 19. As the seasons have passed, the show has gotten progressively worse to where now in season 19, I find myself fast-forwarding through half of each episode. The propaganda is ridiculous. So much so, it's impossible to sit through. Was a great show up to about Season 10. I think it has less to do with actors leaving than the writers. I don't want to give examples because I don't want to give spoilers, but at times, there are characters whose storylines don't stay true to the character. Alex's departure was quite possibly the worst written episode in all of television. I hope they cancel it after Season 20. It's time.
0	"I stopped watching the show midway through the 2nd episode. The costumes and sets are absolutely perfect. The CGI is also really good. The actors do a commendable job with the script they were given. But the script and directing killed the show for me. I rarely knew what the character motivations were, what their goals were. The humor was not funny, it was scripted and childish. The pacing was VERY slow and seemed there only to connect ""events"" which were too cliche, imo. I really wanted to love, like, hell..even be slightly entertained, but I found myself wondering into the 2nd episode why I was wasting my time on another poorly directed/scripted piece of ""entertainment"". This was a complete let down."
0	Disclosure. I have not read the books, but I powered thru the Chinese version I liked it even though it was hard to understand at times. I liked Wang Miao who is believable as a young world class scientist with a family.His role is split into 5 millennials of which only one is interesting. That would be Jin Cheng. The rest are dull and that Augie person just stinks. Can anyone believe that she is a world class physicist like Miao? C'mon man!!!The whole thing seems like a Cliff Note version. Shallow. Weak. But it does have a dumb cameo appearance by Gatiss and Shearsmith. Wow. What a bonus.One star because it's so bad that I gave up.
0	What have they done with this wonderful story? As a massive fan of the book and the first film adaptation Plein Soleil (heck even the Matt Damon version) this makes me weep. Where to start? The casting is awful!!! Awful choices for all three! Why is Tom an old man? Alain Delon was perfect, Jude Law was perfect and even though I don't like her, Gwyneth Paltrow was fantastic as marg. These actors lack everything that the characters embody. Second is the filming to make it look like a 40's film noir. Just why? It literally just looks like a modern film turned b&w with a filter and white balance turned up way too high. 40's film noirs were dark and brooding atmospheric and this lacks all of that. And the acting does fit in with a 40's film noir at allll. Modern acting doesn't fit. It's a complete fail.
1	I was late to the party and didn't really think the show was going to be very good. ABC unfortunately tends to push out PC and material that leans very left. Which again, all for if that's your entertainment but I like shows to take my mind off the left and right nonsense.Season one was great, very surprising. Season two had me hooked and was watching 2-3 eps a night. Buttttttt just like everyone says all good things must come to an end. Season three has taken a turn farrrrrr freaking left. I'm 6 eps in season three and it's pretty bad. Not sure if I can skip the whole season or just stop if this keeps up. Sad to see a good show feel like it needs to bring politics into a show with such magnitude.
0	It's one of those shows that kept me watching until the last episode in the hopes that it gets better (somehow) or otherwise see how much worse it can get. Script and casting were the major fails here. The dialogues made an already ridiculous premise insufferable. Cringe-fest! Eye-rolls to the idea that a group of friends - all very, very young - were somehow the only ones qualified to save humanity from an alien invasion. Eiza Gonzalez was the most unconvincing Auggie (forever dolled up as if about to hit the runway) who was in turn the most unconvincing nanotech innovator. Actor Jess Hong as Jin had potential, but didn't quite get there. Saul was underutilised as a character - until suddenly propelled forward as one of the chosen ones, and for no apparent reason. Alex Sharpe is obviously talented but brought in a pathos and melancholy that seemed rather misplaced next to characters busy cooking up quick calculations and theorems to wage war with aliens as if they were in a YA fictional world. Benedict Wong was probably the only one who pulled off the character of a wry, world-weary detective/ security/body guard (it was never clear what his role was), so I hope he gets a shot at a better show/film in the future. Netflix, why?
1	This show, like most cop shows, is of course completely unrealistic in a million ways. That being said, I'm married to a cop, and this is one of the few cop shows he can actually sit through and enjoy. Good characters, plot lines, etc.Except this insufferable professor/race hustler they have written into the show. She is laughable in the things she says and the attitude she has, than any actual good point they could be making on the subject of policing and racism is lost. And the way the characters on the department actually give her full access to department proceedings and actually value her ridiculous opinions is baffling.Write her out and save this show PLEASE.
1	The world of Fallout is a serious place. Life is cheap, and ends with alarming regularity. The first episode was a joy to watch, really enjoyed studying everything in the background. Incredibly faithful to the look and feel of the games, little easter eggs everywhere. Could have done a lot better on Power Armor, but can't have everything I suppose. Watched episode two, and almost shut it off. Fallout is not a slapstick world. I'll watch episode 3, but if it continues down this Disney Kiddie World I'll have to bail. It will pain me to do so, especially since my secret man-crush Walton Goggins brings it, but I can take only so much cornball humor.
0	"As a Chinese book fan, I was very excited about this ""HOLLYWOOD""series. But after watching it, I have to say it's not just disappointing but almost insulting. If you can adapt GAME OF THRONES like that, why on earth would you make 3 BODY PROBLEM like this?? I can understand the simplification, but not to this childish level. The plot even seems like a soap opera, an urban drama. I can take the characters are not all Asian and of course diversed. But they're all simplified into these patterned figures, which I find very annoying. It seems like the team didn't even like the book, they just want to get this done. Somehow it feels like a disesteem to this amazing book. Because not only you show no understanding about the hidden eastern philosophy of the book, but also you show no patience to get the audience to understand the plot and the characters. I'm really frustrated and furious and wish this series was never made."
0	Against my natural antipathy towards post apocalyptic stuff, I was intrigued by a 5 star rating this series was given by Lucy Mangan in the Guardian.The plot was paper thin. It was so obvious what was going to happen and the level of insult to anyone with a brain was appalling!For example the Lucy Maclean stabbing survival was unbelievable. A stab in the gut is always serious and one should not remove the knife if it is still in the wound. This was followed by the even worse idea that her 'husband' came back to attack her.Equally stupid was the fact that her wrist mounted radiation as well as everyone else's did not go off the moment they met the people from Vault 32. It was clear radiation level awareness was high, but to fail to have automated alarms was, frankly, alarmingly moronic.I skipped forward a few scenes to the army camp and the arrival of the men in suits and immediately thought 'where was the airship built and where were the suits made?'. I had already been wondering about the construction of the vaults themselves, but the industrial level the airship & suits implied was far too farfetched.I could go on but I hope the foregoing gives you enough of the flavour of silliness which clearly is only going to get worse.My advice is avoid like the plague.
2	Game of Thrones has established rules, travelling across Westeros is a multiple episode feat, but nah lets teleport them around whenever we need them to be somewhere. Maybe they've discovered all the locations now, hence the fast travel. Also motivations, is another facet that takes time and also decent writing to seem genuine and not forced.This episode, I feel was a bit better than the disaster that was Episode 4, but what's really holding this season back is honestly the writing. You've heard everyone talk about how it's rushed, and how plot elements have shifted dramatically to suit the end goals the writers have. It really is the case here. Daenerys' flip to a tyrant doesn't feel justified, and the past episodes this season haven't fleshed out this change well at all. She wasn't always a noble ruler, but making the choice to torch all of Kings Landing, just seems like a plot device to push the 'Targaryen Cycle', the writers want to use for some reason.Visually, this episode succeeds for the most part. The vast carnage going on is impressive for TV. It's clear the season was shortened to have grander episodes, with more demanding CGI sequences. I honestly felt we should have had more in between to help flesh out and build up to the decisions, made in these grander episodes. Plot convenience is also getting stronger as we etch towards the end, Drogon can apparently dodge, as well as wipe out all the ships and Balistas with ease, makes you think why he couldn't accomplish this last episode. I could go on and on with little things that make this an underwhelming climax to some long time plotlines we've become so invested with all these years.BTW the leaks for this episode were true, meaning the ending we're heading for does not look promising in the slightest.
2	I am a huge fan of greys anatomy, but personally I think we all can agree that 19 seasons is way to much. To be honest, the downhill of the series was when Sandra Oh left the show. I cannot stand Shonda anymore. She is an incredible, talented woman, but why the hell is she always fighting with the actors and then killing their character??? It's so annoying. Like come on! Kill Meredith already.
0	I've given 4 stars as that's how many seasons were good before they started to get away from the books. The rest of the seasons aren't great. You'd imagine they would lead all the seasons to an ultimate epic final season to explain all the mysteries. Nope, very very poor writing. But it's typical greed, get the seasons out so we can capatilise on how much money can be made.
1	The alleged true story about the stalking of Richard Gadd who actually acts as the main character in the show but calls himself Donny Dunn.Its pretty brave of him to re-live and re-enact the torments he faced, the acting is good overall but there is no comedy or humor in the series, it starts dark and remains dark throughout.It is unique in that it presents the flaws and weird thought processes of both the stalker and the stalked. There are times I found myself blaming both of them for some the scenarios that followed, and maybe this is the whole point of the show, they are both as obsessed as each other.Towards the end of the series an episode mentions a viral video that finally shot Gadd into the limelight. I have searched and cant find the 'viral' video at all.To sum up the show I'd say its quite depressing and unsettling from the outset and then gets worse but still I had to watch it until the end to find out the significance of the title 'baby reindeer' I have scored it a 5 star because I am in the middle lane on this and cant decide whether to go higher or lower..
2	Deviations from the book like, some minor name changes, time changes (Mariko has a child now), added characters (Yabu's nephew), small stuff, which add the run time and gives the story a bit more color. Nothing that would make James Cavell roll over in his grave (RIP).This version of Shogun, so far, gives us more insight into Toranaga's thought process, which you only get from the book and not the early version of Shogun. All for the better, in my opinion.Mariko shows real emotions. Blackthorne has the same grit and determination. LOVE how spineless and manipulative they make the regents!This is a much gritter looking version of Shogun. Much more like what I would envision for a city of 1600 Japan.The first 2 episodes have been such a delight and promising. I hope they keep up the pacing and storyline.
2	This series disembodied the book. So if you're seeking a faithful adaptation that captures the book's essence you might prefer the Chinese version.Though armed with a higher production budget than the Chinese version, evident in the special effects, it comes at the cost of some plot details. In this retelling, there are more bodies to follow, too. In fact, this series adds 5 new characters who take on some of the roles originally filled by one character in the book. As I viewer I struggled to find them compelling enough or necessary. Maybe it is because I've read the book and seen enough of the Chinese version that makes me think that these writers had an opportunity to create a better adaptation. Overall, it is entertaining enough, but don't read the book before or if you have, keep an open mind.
0	Shiny lightsabers, things that look like things make me feel good!No matter breaking cannon or lore or even bad pacing.Modern filmmaking at its finest, as expected.Nearly as good as Halo.Seriously, how do you have a world full of amazing lore and end up with this?Cannon changes out of pure spite, washing away Fallout 1 & 2 and Fallout New Vegas. (The latter being easily the best in the franchise)It looks good, and some good actors, but the incessant changes just feel like pointless cultural appropriation.I'd rather play Fallout 76 than watch this again.Expecting this review to be deleted by Amazon owned IMDB...
1	Maybe the best show in human history untill season 8 where the storywriting is just, well it is so bad im speechless.I really hope we sometime in the future get the last season remade.
2	Very pleased with this show so far. Seems to pay homage to the source material. And is beautiful to watch.Casting seems great, costumes superb, little SFX used also brilliant. Feudal Japanese seems incredibly realistic as much as it is complex. All the leads including the son are great actors. I wish I had read the book rather than watched the Richard Chamberlain series many moons ago. BUT so far, so excellent.Its probably gonna get some unfair comparisons to GoT but so what, yes its poltiical and yes its similar, but its just brilliant masterclass writing of West meets East with plenty of historical flair.I really hope you enjoy it as much as I am right now. X. And I hope I can read some material on any mistakes on the Japanese Feudal era as its quite captivating coming from a Westerners point of view.Nevertheless I am really enjoying this historical drama.
1	"It's a decent production and from what I remember seems to be faithful to the novel. However, this is clearly another attempt at Hollywood revisionist history. For starters it's filmed in Vancouver. You can tell that the buildings are sets. Within the first 20 minutes there is a samurai being dressed down by a woman. And of course, they had to find a dark-skinned Japanese woman to play Mariko. Interview with Anna Sawai.If you're thinking great, here we go, you'd be correct. Here are excerpts from the LA Times article ""Anna Sawai's 'Shogun' role felt personal: Mariko is 'every woman in Japan who has suffered"", FEB. 25, 2024""I wanted to know that they weren't just trying to do another white savior story,"" says Sawai. ""That they were going to do it right this time.""Her ""layer of contemporary attitude,"" as Marks calls it, is what enables audiences to see Mariko as a sympathetic character. It's rooted in Sawai's awareness of the various Hollywood tropes and misrepresentations that have plagued Japanese women onscreen for decades.""I didn't want it to be another depiction of Japanese women being sexualized by white men,"" says Sawai. ""I wanted this to be the right portrayal of women.""--Shogun was great because it was an accurate portrayal of feudal Japan. This may have been, if not for the attempt to modernize it. Which begs the question, if you're not creating your own production, with your own artistic interpretation, then why remake it? Why, indeed?"
1	Sure, this show has issues. I think the Foundation show on Apple TV is wayyyyy better. But this is fine enough. All these extremely negative reviews all sound exactly the same-so they're either echoing each other because they can't form their own opinions, or they're bots to tank the ratings. If I hadn't read the books I'd probably would have stopped watching, but that's mostly cause I don't watch a ton of shows so I can be rather picky. But as as adaption it's good enough. I really hope they get to do season 2, cause that's my favorite book of the series. Not sure how they're going to adapt book 3 cause dang if it doesn't get super sci-fi trippy.
1	"I agreed to watch these from the start with my girlfriend.I resisted at first but quickly got into it - the show is (was) full of drama, comedy, sadness, the whole Variety pack.I had to stop watching the last season 17.Although the show always tackled difficult social issues it did it as part of a story line, not always well, but it was always a situation that affected a character and you would see it play out.This started to become less nuance as time went on until you get to season 17 where the characters all but look down the lens and say ""these are the top ten reasons why America is racist"" There is no story line or investigation into motivations or character just some glib -""yeah I am going to try harder not to murder my patients with racism""Also Grey herself - how many times is this woman going to die?The Terminator would have called it a day by now!I swear she has her own parking space in PurgatoryThe security guards see her coming and just wave her through.""Hey, Meredith, what got you this time? Oh, a dolphin fell out of a hot-air balloon and crushed the ambulance that was carrying you away from that train wreck? What are the chances, eh?""All things have to come to and end.This must surely be the end."
0	The plot was so thin and the characters so gutted by bad writing in this season that I am not sure who even cares anymore about spoiler alerts. I thought it could only get better after episode 3 but episode 4 was even stupider.I don't usually do reviews but I have to vent somehow. I really was not expecting much in Season 8 in spite of the hype but the atrocious writing, thin to ridiculous plot lines and poor cinematography has managed to disappoint even my low expectations.The plot lines and characters have become so stupid they are almost unwatchable. I mean really? Daenerys is supposed to be the Super Queen? How many times can she walk like a dunce into a big Cersei trap and get all her men killed before most of them just say forget this I am not following this dunce anymore. She has now managed to stupidly get two of her dragons killed off, and by what bows and arrows!! Ha, ha, that's hilarious. Why not just fly around the boats and burn them up from behind? They can't shoot arrows through their own rigging and masts!! Not to mention there is no way arrows could ever destroy ships like that. Especially ridiculous arrows made out of iron!! They would be too heavy to even shoot, have a range of about 10 feet.I give up. It was just too stupid to even make any more omments about it.Sad, sad, sad stuff.Not sure I am going to even watch the last two episodes.
2	This show is up there with The Last of Us and Arcane as proof that video games CAN be adapted to TV shows successfully, as long as you treat the source material with respect.I don't know the games well enough to comment on the small details, but from what I do know of them, Jonathan Nolan and co have definitely got the world right. It feels very authentic to the games, capturing the awe every player feels on exiting the vault for the first time, on seeing the destruction of the wider world around the vault, on discovering the various settlements, on encountering the various weirdos around the Wasteland...taking the route of creating a wholly new story within the established world of Fallout was definitely the best creative decision they made here.The cast are incredible, too. From relative unknowns (to me, at least) like Aaron Moten (Maximus) and Moisés Arias (Norm MacLean), to better-knowns (to me, again) like Zach Cherry (Woody), Leslie Uggams (Betty), Sarita Choudhury (Moldaver), and Ella Purnell (Lucy MacLean), all the way up to the iconic Kyle MacLachlan (Hank MacLean) and Walton Goggins (The Ghoul), everyone is impeccably cast and each plays their role perfectly.The story itself is REALLY good, with the three distinct journeys - Lucy's, The Ghoul's, and Maximus' - being woven together brilliantly at times while also getting enough room to breathe and build on their own. I can't wait to see what this series has planned for the future. I only wish it was a couple of episodes longer.
2	"Absolutely!""Jessica"" offers a tour de force in acting prowess, with both leading characters delivering performances that are nothing short of extraordinary. Each episode takes viewers on a thrilling journey, with twists and turns that keep them on the edge of their seats.In the end. It's a series that lingers in the mind long after credits roll, leaving viewers clamoring for more. With its stellar performances, impeccable writing, and bold storytelling choices, ""Jessica"" stands as a shining example of what modern series can achieve. Just loved it. I hope it never ends. Netflix thanks for that."
0	Although all of the actors do a great job of portraying their respective characters, the storylines are boring and political. I read the news, I listen to the news, I am very well informed as to the state of this country. In my opinion, politics should stay OUT of ENTERTAINMENT and sports. We watch these shows and games to ESCAPE reality, NOT to wallow in it.
1	Like the show & the cast. Except for Ellen Pompeo. She's too irritating. Amazing a show that is supposed to be centered around her is better without her. I'd rather watch scenes that don't include Meredith. Sandra Oh is brilliant as always... her character is driven, intelligent but yet very vulnerable. Love it. Katherine Heigl plays the perfect beautiful woman in a man's career who is usually overlooked because she is beautiful. She plays the character well. At first I didn't like Justin Chambers character but Dr. Karev has developed into a very interesting character & hope to see much more stories with him. I do like Patrick Dempsey's character. Dr. Sheppard is very sexy & entertaining. He seems to show charisma even when serious. Love the introduction after the first season of Kath Walsh. She's the woman you at first love to hate. In the second season she's become a well rounded character & fun to watch. Over all the series is good. I do think it could lose Ellen Pompeo & still be a great series. Truthfully of all the friends & family I know who watch regularly... NO one likes her.
0	The ending should be in minus figures. Although the long night and the build up promised so much. 8 years of my life watching what should have been a classic in the making. Now all everyone can talk about is what we're they thinking in the last 2 episodes! Shame on you, lazy rushed amateur ending, made no sense. Hope Disney sees sense and let's you nowhere near Star Wars now!
2	"...this is not that.While it was certainly groundbreaking and a huge hit at the time, in retrospect great parts of it was rather cheasy and cheapish, and come on, none of us REALLY bought Richard Chamberlain as a rugged and battle hardened sea officer ;)The 2024 version feels a great deal more modern and budgeted bigger.It's rougher, it's dirtier, the action scenes are crafted much better, the camera work is much better and reminds you of a Hollywood blockbuster, the lighting and visuals are stunning to the point of being art, and they are underlined by sound effects and a score which amplifies the mood of every scene perfectly.The script is much richer and intricate than the original series, with better dialogue allowing the much enlarged gallery of characters more complexity and debth, which is especially important to American and European audiences, when depicting a very ""foreign"" culture... and it is all perfectly executed by a stellar cast, some of whom are getting their international breakthrough on this show.I just love it, it's probably not only the show of the year, but something we will constantly crave more of in years to come, and which competitors will try to copy.I should mention this is based off the first 6 episodes, so we are yet to see large scale battle scenes (but looking at the teaser clips, they look exellent), and we are yet to see the all important ending so I will reserve a possible 10 for then - but I am quite hopeful that is where it lands.It's a show that makes you annoyed it is a limited series, by nature of James Clavell having written only one novel on feudal Japan.. but I actually predict this will be such a big hit, that FX will attempt to have scripts written for either a prequal, continuation - or spin offs - because that period of Japanese history is ripe with potential - and come on, who doesn't like samurais?This is a must see show, even if you don't like samurais, even if you don't like period dramas, even if you don't like foreign language entertainment, even if you don't like subtitles - because if you don't watch it, you will be the person left out of the conversation, when the topic becomes entertainment.Enjoy :)"
1	First seasons were good really good, the last seasons, probably because the writer of the books left the team, were just mmmmkay, the last season, at least the 3 first episodes, just no Ruining the whole series, I'm not sure if I will continue watching the series, the mega epic battle they preperared us for 7 SEASONS was so stupid irrational and boring, nothing interesting happened finish in the most stupid lazy written and not really creative way, sooo many stupid miments, like since when white walkers even need to eat why the giant decided to eat lady mormot? A nice snack? Why did yiu literally just kill all dethraki? Any reason for the usless charge? Why to hide people in crypts while literally fighting someone who rises the dead? Seriously aria just teleported from no where and killed the night king? The crows carried her? May be lord of Light? Does her ultimate have cool down?could you pay a battle advisor to desigh the battle not to be ridiculous and atupid, they literally had the same budget as lord of the rings which was 3 times longer, but yet here we are having a horible waste of time
1	"As a person who watched ""the talented Mr. Ripley"" with Jude Law and Matt Damon first and then this serie, I would say my review is not gonna be the same as the most of ones.For those who have not watched the movie yet, I would definitely recommend you to start the serie. It's really great, with just 8 episodes, easy to watch. The key of the serie is the cinematography and the black-white filter, gives another vibe to the serie and it's just brilliant, it's suit it perfectly. Netflix made a great work producing it, definitely It's one of the best serie that you gonna fine in Netflix.Personally I didn't enjoy the serie as much as I would like. The movie was much greater, not the way which is made, but the acting part of it. Jude Law was awesome, his body language and his acting way gave another tone to the movie. I can't say that Johnny Flynn had the same Era in the serie, he was much more calm and more serious, without any extraordinary acting skills. Same for Andrew Scott, Matt Damon was seem brilliant by the way of his acting, his movements, you could say that this guy has an IQ high as Noone else. Andre Scott was very simple, nothing special, his facial expressions weren't something that you could say wow what an acting. Personally I found it strange because I really love Andrew Scott and I follow his work for years, but in this one because of the movie didn't left me amazed.I know that maybe it's my fault and I compare them, but I can't act as I never watch the movie.."
0	I am not sure where is the problem. Either Chinese storytelling is too different from Western storytelling or it is a bad adaptation of a great book, or the book is outright boring too (I didn't read it, and from what I have seen in this show, there is no chance I will). The show pace is very slow. It is supposed to be about an alien invasion, but there is little or no hint of the supposed aliens. Even the science is flawed, something I can stand if the storytelling is great (yeah, there is not such a thing like a Death Star, but who cares?...).This is the second recent show I have seen about an alien invasion with little or no aliens and a poor script. I hope it will improve. Writers should stop trying to do scripts for a very small subset of the viewers, and focus more on doing enjoyable shows.
0	I tried. Really I tried. I watched the first two episodes. I fell asleep in the middle of each one. That does not bode well for the compelling nature of the show.I can see that they've spent a huge amount of money on very complicated sets. It's certainly a lavish production.But I never played the game. I mean I could see where certain elements were obviously storyboarded right off of a video game. And the NPC nature of a number of characters is clear enough. But am I supposed to care about an NPC? I don't know if I really care about these characters. This girl this naive girl who has incestuous relations with her cousin, is this who I'm supposed to root for? And then this Cowboy ghost/zombie whatever, am I supposed to care about him? I don't identify with any of these characters. I don't care about any of these characters.Look it starts they've been in a bomb shelter a long time. Okay. Radiation bad. Okay. And they decide they're going to trade marriages with the adjacent Enclave. Okay. Everybody seems to have Geiger counters on their wrists yet when the door opens up to the adjacent Enclave no one checks. I mean in a world filled with radiation you would think that would be the number one thing you do when you open the door. This doesn't seem very smart. This doesn't make anyone in this Enclave seem intelligent. It makes them seem like idiots. And they die like idiots.Do they think I'm going to identify with idiots and root for them? If so they are sorely mistaken.And then this naive girl decides she's going to go out all alone in the big bad and I don't know find Lassie or her father or whatever.I really don't care.When I watched Spider-Man, Tobey Maguire's character was similarly naive. But he was also smart. He made some intelligent moves. He made some blunders and he learned from them but the character seemed to grow.In this show I have a real sense of here's character a. Here is character b. Character B will say something to character a. Character B will now leave. Character a will now go to character C and say something. And on and on it goes. Girl loses her eye. Is this necessary to the plot? Would the story be any different if she never lost the eye? Guy loses his foot. Is this necessary to the plot? With the story be any different if he never lost his foot? So why am I seeing this.Continuing the Spider-Man comparison, when Peter Parker made a bad selfish call, he paid with the life of his uncle ben. This made a difference to the character to the story. From there on in you see him consciously making efforts to make better choices.I didn't get a sense of that with this show.Here's a guy. He's going to steal a Iron Man suit from another guy. He can't fly it very well. The flying looks very much like a man on wires. At one point the CGI slipped and I actually saw the wires a little bit. That wasn't good. With all the money they spent on sets here I'm surprised they went cheap on the flying effects. Robert Downey did it very well in iron man. If you're not going to meet that standard then don't show him flying.There's a difference between playing a video game and watching a movie. Maybe you haven't noticed but your friends aren't terribly entertained by watching you play a video game. Making a movie which is essentially the same as watching someone play a video game is not a good path.Anyhow. Two episodes was enough for me. I won't be back.It's not a bad production. If anything it's quite lavish in terms of sets. But if you want characters emotions things to identify with, the normal elements of the successful show, you won't find that here.
0	Firstly a confession - I hated this TV series so much that I only made it to the end of episode 6 before I gave up - I figured if I couldn't be won over in six hours it was probably never going to happen. Given this fact the reader should be aware that some amazing transformation may have taken place later which make this series far better than I am giving it credit for - though everyone I've spoken to who likes the series thought it was great from the start so I'm guessing the quality (or lack of it) is pretty consistent throughout. My objections? Firstly the writing is terrible - characters speak in this strange and special 'fantasy genre' dialogue which is stiff and comic (when it's not supposed to be) - the series looks cheap and nasty too - sets are often clearly studio bound with weak design, poor lighting and a strangely dated feel - it looks like a 1970/80s BBC Shakespeare production a lot of the time. The series also takes itself far too seriously - the whole thing has a portentous quality and apparently fails utterly to recognise its own silliness. I have absolutely nothing against the fantasy genre - the LOTR books and films are great - but this is a weak addition and I'd recommend avoiding it.
2	Before I start this review, I have to say that I have never played a Fallout game, though I know the basic premise so I won't be judging my opinion of the show based on any of the games. Though I have now finished watching the Fallout TV Show and here is my review for it. The premise of the show sees a post apocalypse world after a nuclear war which sees people living in vaults underground to avoid the dangers of the surface.Main Character Ella Purnell plays Lucy McLean and she is fantastic in this show. Her character has a fantastic character development throughout and I just think she played up the role really well. She was a likeable character and somebody who was easy to root for in this show. There is a naivety to her as she interacts with other characters but it can come across as charming and gives her a way to develop.Supporting Characters Aaron Moten plays Maximus and he is decent in his role. It personally took me longer to care about his character then the others and I just think Moten didn't convey much emotion or reason to care about him. But that does mostly change midway through the show and Moten starts to grow into the role and add some more personality.Walton Goggins plays Cooper Howard/The Ghoul and he is tremendous in both versions of his character. We see Goggins as Cooper in his prime, before the nuclear war and it is interesting to see, especially compared to his undead bounty hunter persona in the modern day story. He is very charismatic and the fact that he has all this story about him does make him the most interesting part of the show and Goggins smashes it.Moises Arias plays Norm McLean and he is very good in the show and gets given his own story arc which is actually important for the overall show. He is mostly separate from the other main characters but he does an effective job and I grew to like his character more after the first episode.This has a big cast, that have smaller roles here and they are all great. This world is full of lively people and it feels like a vibrant world because of their performances whether they be on the surface or in the vaults, it was really effective.Story The story is great, as I said I have no idea about The Fallout story in the games but I became really invested in this shows plot and interested throughout. We see stories both on the wasteland and in the vaults and both are pretty captivating and do a good job of developing the characters. The flashbacks are good as well and are used effectively to give more context for the storytelling.Script The show is well written, it has moments of comedy in there but also plenty of dramatic moments that made me care. There are many twists and intrigue here and I think the writing did an effective job of showing this.Style Amazon clearly had high hopes for Fallout as you can see the massive budget used and the show looks fantastic. Both the wasteland and Vaults look so unique and fully encapsulate the tone of the show. Though, I think there were some issues, mainly the overuse of slow-mo in action scenes. I think slow-mo is a tool that can be used effectively but it has to be used carefully and this show definitely overuses it. I also know that country music is heavily involved with the games and it is well treated here but again it is just overused, especially during some of the action scenes that didn't require it.Overall Overall, the first season of Fallout was fantastic. It made me super interested in this universe and hyped for a potential second season. Even if you haven't played any of the games, this is still a show that should be watched because I think you will really enjoy it.Rating - 9/10.
1	This show is entertaining for sure, but it can't seem to commit to many plotlines. Relationships and characters disappear very abruptly, sometimes without explanation. It's very frustrating to not see romances or storylines fulfilled.
0	Episode one was mildly interesting. Episode 2 was a cliché-ridden bore. It was as if the writers had a very short list of things that were going to take place during episode 2 and had to drag out the action sequences as much as possible to take up time. Lots of pointless gore and really dumb in-fight choices on the part of the protagonists. I'm familiar with the game - never played it myself but have watched others play it. Maybe if you like the game you'll like the series because you'll see references to it throughout the episodes. But, if you're not a fan of the game, and you actually read books with good stories, you'll probably hate this series, so I recommend you don't waste your time. Like most garbage being produced these days, this series telegraphs everything that's going to happen, because the writers seems to not have any original ideas of their own.
2	The early seasons of Grey's were so great! I loved the characters and their stories. The show is still good years later, but nothing will ever compare to the original cast!
2	Hopeful season 5 will bring back what we loved about seasons 1 and 2, which they tried to recapture in s4. Yes, s3 was a clear departure into wokeville, but they still kept a lot of the heart of the show. I think they were testing to see how far it needed to go, which was unnecessary. This cop show does a great job of embracing diversity already from race and culture to neurodivergence. I understood they were trying to show that, yes, there are corrupt cops (and Brandon Routh plays such a good jerk that when he pops up on a show, I'm already booing him lol), but they ALSO showed most cops are in the job to help people and not ALL white men are the devil. Clearly, the show's frontrunner is one. Duh.So I kept watching through s4 and they returned to the basics of what makes this a great show. I adore Nathan Fillion, and I love how they appeal to a wide audience balancing action/procedure/cases/politico-socio drama with personal stories, danger, and relationships we can't help but invest in. I'd bring it up to a 9 if there weren't quite so many conveniences taken in the storylines that stretch way beyond reality. But overall, it's fun. I really hope they keep it that way with s5+.
0	So the problem with the reviews is that almost all are people who played the video game. I did not and watched this as a stand alone series. It was so lame...such a cool idea as a story but had no substance at all. If you want to watch an underground bunker story, I recommend Cloverfield Lane.I literally turned it off after 16 minutes, so maybe I didn't give it a chance. But the acting sucked, the CGI was horrible. Why are they wearing matching suits anyway? And why are so many games being made into movies EXCEPT The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time? Which is definitely the best game of all time :)Give it a go if you are not a gamer, be forewarned this is a little lame.Edit: I got through 1.5 episodes. I thought all this hype surely meant it would be good. I would rather watch paint dry. Why anyone rates this above a 2, is beyond me. This show is absolutely awful in my personal opinion.
0	Unflattering and unbelievable diverse characters, men stupid, women serious and super smart heavy swearers. Yawn. Characters seem to be reciting the script but zero ability to portray friendship and working together. It's like everyone is doing an individual mediocre performance and someone edited the conversations together.The anti God theme in this series is exactly the problem science will never solve. Neither will aloof serious arrogant swearing smoking women as portrayed in this series.Science stagnating and/or going backwards? This series tells us why. There will be no new major discoveries. Cern is not something we should be messing with.
1	We have a military guy, who knows or did not learned nothing during his time in the army. He is a joke, he doesn't think, strategize, knows about combat or anything, why he wanna wear a power armor? Because flashbacks of someone saving him.We have a pretty inocente girl that after her vault is mostly slayed, no one seems to really care, they making an assembly and after that there's already 30 survivors there. Nothing makes sense.And of course, we have deadpool, but he is also the Man in Black from Westworld, also he has superpowers.And the CGI Blood and Gore ? Omg ... Fallout: The Boys.
2	I think that this series is the best of all. First, it doesn't include only '' med-things''but drama things about the life' s doctor and their routine.
1	"I'm not a fan of the game, but Uupon watching two episodes of ""Fallout,"" I was surprised to find it receiving such high praise in the IMBD ratings score. However, my experience thus far has left me underwhelmed. One of my main gripes with the series is its reliance on low-tech elements, which seems out of place in a science fiction setting. The technology, particularly the suits worn by the Knights, feels outdated and lacks the innovation one would expect. While the initial introduction of the Knights was impressive, it ultimately fell short of my expectations. I had hoped for a more captivating experience, but unfortunately, I found myself disappointed by the lackluster performance in these first two episodes. So far it's watchable I will watch the remaining episodes."
0	Besides the numerous inconsistencies from the period of time which are disrespectful and fictional. The fact that the writers and directors decided to use Japanese and English but refer Portuguese as English was extremely confusing, I thought I had dubs on because it didn't make any sense. The show is either for Americans only or dumbed down, so many shows have 3/4 languages spoken and this show can't handle 2? And there are actors that do speak Portuguese? It became unwatchable after knowing that they only steered the series towards Americans. Terrible creative decision. Horrible boring series.
2	I'm not usually into medical shows, but I enjoy Grey's Anatomy because of the characters and the soap-opera style story lines. I like finding out what characters are hooking up, breaking up, how relationships between them develop and how they deal with family situations. I also really enjoy the comedic writing on the show and Grey's has it in spades. I won't lie, it also doesn't hurt that there's some pretty good eye candy in the cast. Some of the acting is a bit shaky here and there, but there are some strong performances put on, especially by Sandra Oh as intern Cristina Yang. Even though, as I said earlier, I'm not usually into medical shows, I find myself almost intrigued by the medical aspect of the show.
0	"I barely managed thru episode 3 and am at the moment struggling thru episode 4. Writing this while I watch is the actual puding (where the proof is, get it?). Anyhow, my interest is fading fast. My biggest issue at the moment is not how to talk this show down and convince you not to waste time, because I know you will give it a try, and perhaps you should, but how to come up with 400 more characters i need to write in order to get this posted. I still don't understand why our reviews have to be so ""substantial"" when nobody reads thru them to the end enyway? I wish they'd let us post video reviews, something like tik-tok :) wouldnt that be crazy, eh? Anyhoo, this tv series is super boring. Each epsiode should be no more than 10 minutes long. Jam pack 'em with dialogue and get it over with fast."
0	The caliber of the production is far above average and from viewing point of view was a real treat visually To my mind the storyline wanders from the novel and is confusing. The confusion is due in large part to the use of captions In my opinion the biggest disappointment was the use captions on the Japanese dialogue. The captions turned off people. Considering the amount of money spent producing this series why wouldn't you give the viewer the option to select language as does Netflix on foreign.films. When it's possible to offer different language why would you not? Cast was excellent. All things considered, a lost effort.
0	"It's a shame the show lost its writing staff. But hey, what a stroke of luck that a bus full of teenagers on the way to Magic Mountain were available to write this season.This episode puts the um? In dumb. If it wasn't bad enough that we were subjected to Tim's dumb evil twin, expecting us to buy that he has a girlfriend who looks like vata-from-the-hood Chen is a bridge too far...and the cringey ""we'd better practice kissing"" scene between the real Tim and Chen was just wrong on multiple levels.And the woke Hollywood B. S. has been staggeringly unrelentless this season. It's one thing that Hollywood is following the leftist agenda that citizens ought not be armed, but when they extend it to police, that's just stoopid. As bad guys are coming out of vehicles with automatic weapons, experience-hardened ""Rookie"" John Nolan's best strategy is to stand out in the open and call his girlfriend. When he finally gets around to thinking about trying to even the odds with weaponry, he finds out that the police station gun safe is inaccessible because, get this, ""the sheriff has the key."" How stoopid do the showrunners really think the viewing public is? Wait...don't answer that, this is Kalifornia...we know how stoopid the viewing public is. Also, the fact that the frequent gun fights on the show are now reduced to CGI flashes of light added in post-production, because Alec Baldwin screwed up one time in a hundred year history of safe simulated gunfights in Hollywood just seals the fact that this show is a pandering runaway train of woke idiocy.We've seen it before...shows that go on season break and never come back. If that were to happen to The Rookie, I would not be able to muster up a surprised look on my face. The music that plays towards the end of this episode starts with the words ""I do believe that I've had enough..."" I can't decide whether those portentious lyrics seem best appropriate from the show staff or the viewing public.#ChensAnIdiot."
0	"A commendable adaptation that manages to create a more atmospheric unfolding of the initial stages of the story than the Chinese version.The production is quite something, the visuals are dazzling, acting is solid... however, one can only call this intellectual & original sci-fi if one has never come across Stanislaw Lem, Ph. K. Dick, R. Silverberg, R. Bradbury etc.Rehashing age-old sci-fi ideas in a postmodern mix that can be entertaining, intriguing, and visually pleasing at the same time is not exactly 'intellectual' and certainly not original.There is a very sharp delimitation point in the series, around episode 5 - when the entire promising thing turns into absurd banality packed full of cliches.Spoiler alert... The pivotal moment of the aliens discovering what lies are and that humans can lie comes after decades of conversations and the deployment of a mind-probing virtual reality game that allows them to select a number of key people. And yet... this civilisation after such a long and deep interaction with the human mind does not realise that we lie... until... one person tells them in an audio conversation.From that moment onward, the tropes of ""we shall build a Moon base"" in, metaphorically speaking, minutes with current technology, the scheme of accelerating a payload with a human in it in a way that (to put it very, very mildly) would not be survived by a human body, and so on and so on become simply painful to watch.It is one thing to have a plot hole of the size of the Mariana Trench in the centre of the entire story, but it is another thing to violate basic science whilst claiming to be operating with the outer reaches of highly evolved science.Unfortunately, it is yet another series that not only doesn't adhere to very old sci-fi ideas that it regurgitates in a tarted-up form, but it cannot adhere even to the laws of elementary logic.And then we wonder why some who have not had previous contact with science fiction end up considering the entire genre as some brainless fantasy with no value."
0	"Is was spoiled by his presence all the ""Fallout"" and all the nucleus theme of the show. More men suffer from complexes is difficult to imagine. How could this happen, that it became known as an actor?? Party crowd, more of talent should not apply. Many people think that Craig, obscene in their choice. So I say, 100 (hundred) Craig saints next to them in this regard. Just annoying to be extremely slow, clumsy turns of the body. And sits in a chair like a pregnant bear. It's awful indecent and ugly to see on the screens. I totally was not to be interested in watching of a TV series with this mistakes and while the breaks to see the advertising staff. The series ""Fallout...."" I started to watching from the Season 1 in the hope there to see actors and instead of these great actors had to seen the entire screen obscured by unsympathetic. TV Shows on the nucleus theme, and so not very much so, and spoil their presence by such as the dogmeat. Do not respect the viewers time. Kind regards only salutations."
2	"The story is hilarious, somewhat thrilling, and full of suspense but left with one major flaw in the writing in favor of Ripley which makes it less compelling to my final impression. Cinematography is beautiful that goes hand in hand with Black & White. The film takes place in Italy and made it more visually delicious to watch. 8 Episodes format that covers all necessary elements for the story to end in a timely fashion: not too dragging, nor too short which i appreciate instead of cliffhangers for several more seasons like many other TV series out there. Tom Ripley actor is a perfect pathological liar that seems to be the center of everything. Other casts especially Italians complimented great suspense to the story which makes the film really enjoyable to watch. Overall, i give Ripley about 8/10 with 2 points deducted because of the writing of one key important scene and one important character: 1. Idiocy of Inspector that never asks the important question to Marge while he obviously skimmed through photos which included the photo of ""real"" Dickie just to later found out in the book as a comedic ending which i find it to be too on the nose. 2. Marge who is completely suspected of Tom Ripley's foul play since the very beginning yet never commit to anything and easily fell to Ripley's flimsy excuses at the end."
1	Game of thrones was one of my favourite series and was a solid 9 or 10 throughout seasons 1 to 7. I thought season 8 started well but then just nose dived in the last 2 episodes. What were they thinking? It's like they sat round a table with a list of endings and they decided to pick the lamest, blandest one. Where was the quality control? I was planning on watching the whole thing again once it had finished, but now, what's the point? When I know it ends so poorly. Unfortunately, it has tainted the whole thing for me, and takes it down to a 5. I won't be watching it again and will be selling my box sets. Massively disappointed. Watch Chernobyl instead. More shocking and REAL. And you don't have to take 2 weeks off work to watch it.
0	"The execution is utterly lifeless, vapid, dull, surface-level, and lacking in a unique stylistic flair to distinguish itself amongst an over-stimulated world of mass-produced mediocre content that gets mindlessly promoted and quickly forgotten.It is sad to see another dull tv-show get overhyped by the masses, accumulating loads of popularity for no reason other than notoriety and big budget cinema ($20 million per episode ~ $160 million in total - which is absolutely abhorrent, that money could cure child poverty). Unfortunately this one never utilises its big budget in any meaningful or profound way.Wooden/one-note/mediocre/cheesy acting/Out of place ""comedy""/Too much melodrama when it wasn't the selling point of the show.Bland CGIThere are no audio-visual stylistic risks to hide the wooden acting and bland CGI.Presents it's thoughts on Astronomy/Science/The Fermi Paradox/The Dark Forest Hypothesis/Philosophy/The incompressible vastness of space in such simplistic and surface-level ways. You can learn a lot more about these topics from Fraser Cain, SciShow, Elderfox Documentaries, Anton Petrov, Cool Worlds, Dr Becky, Dreksler Astral, Geographics, etc... and to go beyond that Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, Brian Cox, Frank Drake, Vera Rubin, Michio Kaku, etc...Loads of DEI that is deforming the perception of art, brainwashing people into accepting mediocrity in contemporary media, and ultimately encouraging conformity to the point where opinions in the minority are frowned upon because they don't meet a societal standard. A sensible way to actually embrace cultural diversity/variety is to travel, reflect, express gratitude, continuously improve yourself, find purpose, stay curious, and keep an open mind. Surely this is common sense? Instead what is currently happening is people are blindly accepting mediocrity because it aligns with an agenda, an agenda that is limiting the possibilities of art.Reading other reviews here is quite funny. The people hyping this up have probably seen < 100 films in their life, and < 5 tv-shows in their life, and they're probably hyping up mainstream dross like barbie, oppenheimer, lord of the rings, every batman film, every nolan film, every scorsese film, etc...If you want real profundity in the form of cinema, go watch Avalon, Serial Experiments Lain, Blame!, Ghost in the Shell, Akira, Patlabor 2, Steamboy, Stalker, Involution, instead. Genuine pieces of art that don't pander to the viewer and prioritise atmosphere/style/mood/detail/intimacy over plot and dialogue - unfortunately this will never appeal to the masses because it's easier to talk about plot than it is to talk about atmosphere/style/mood/detail/intimacy.Gradually, year-by-year, I find myself drifting farther and farther apart from mainstream cinema. This is another stepping stone to a personal appreciation for true artistic enlightenment.Disappointing and sadly forgettable. It's not unwatchable, but mostly a waste of time and money. Not worth the hype.2 / 10."
2	I was totally mesmerized by this magnificent production. It was different and better in my estimation then the movie version a talented Mr. Ripley! I thought the scenery. The fact that it was in black-and-white use of Italian actors and dialogue was very special.I was most impressed by the detective in the series. He was so matter-of-fact but yet very deliberate and very unyielding in his effort to find the murderers or murderer or missing person.But that really is the problem I have with the series and it is this detective who is looking for one and perhaps two people never looked for them with the help of a photograph . What detective looks for a missing person without a photograph? It for the end was certainly poetic license, but I believe it was a fatal flaw.Nevertheless, this series certainly deserves an 8 rating in my estimation!
1	I started watching this because i saw edits about cristina yang on youtube and i was immediately drawn to the show because of cristina's don't-carish, cold, funny attitude. So, obviously, i went to search who the actress was. Sandra oh. So then i went to watch the show. Honestly, the light of every episode is her. She made every episode nicer, more interesting and more funny. Sandra did an amazing, perfect job at acting her out with the way she said things. The show is interesting enough to watch, but honestly only until season 10. Cristina leaves in season 10 and the quality of the show drastically dropped. There was no spark anymore. So if you are watching grey's and are on any seasons before season 10, let me say this: if you are watching only for cristina yang, don't watch seasons 11-19. I mean- i only watch the episodes that have mention of cristina (yes there is) 14x07, 14x09, 14x19, 16x08, 16x09, 19x16 overall, grey's anatomy is a really good, interesting and nice show, but it has not been that good in the recent seasons. For me, seasons 1-4 and 10 were the best.Also anyone who wants to start watching now can i say that you will spend a lot of time on it. I spent 3 weeks watching 10 seasons and a few episodes of other seasons.
2	This historical drama is well made. I dont know if the budget is big but the production is very serious and has done a very precise depiction of the japaneese culture and customs at that time. What stands out the most to me is the cultural behaviour of that time that is very distinct and rigorous. Its actually at par with the story as the highpoint of this series.The acting is fenomenal. Everyone does an amazing job and its a real treat to watch the actors act out the japaneese culture.Camera and sound is hardly noticeable because the timing of everything is so good that you are so into what you watch that you dont notice the music.The diversity aspect have been heavily cut down, thankfully.. but they couldnt leave it all alone. The main character, the anjin(englishman) is half armenian, half english, but thats pretty much it. I guess the diversity aspect only have to apply to White peoples productions..The story is allright but kinda slow and not the series strong part and also why I gave this 8/10⭐ and not 9.I recommend this but beware of the slow tempo.
0	This show used to be so good! I remember loving the characters and the storyline in the beginning. But everyone falls in and out of love so fast now, the characters are basically regurgitated versions of past characters, and the plot most episodes is lacking.We also recently see doctors performing an abortion that doesn't seem to have much sensible reasoning behind it? One minute the baby is perfectly healthy, the next they are killing it?The show has taken a very dark and evil turn. It's sad that stuff like this is written and played in front of the masses and we are all expected to act like it's okay. It's not okay. It's truly shameful.
0	The first two episodes of this show start strong and set up some interesting ideas, but past that point the show devolves into thoroughly dull character drama and some truly dreadful characters and acting with even worse writing and dialogue. Drawn out and boring, the show jumps from bizarre idea to bizarre idea and doesn't pay off any of them in anything resembling a satisfying or rewarding way, leaving only dissatisfaction and frustration after slogging through all 8 painful episodes. The show desperately tries to pretend to be smart but in reality is extraordinarily stupid and unjustifiably impressed with itself while being thoroughly mediocre. Not worth the time spent watching it.
2	I've played a few of the games this is based on and figured this production would go one of two ways. Thankfully, it went well.Firstly, for fans of the game, it's Easter Egg galore and very faithful to what I know of the game series. The series focuses on a handful of core characters with some worthy supporting roles for secondary characters which also feels very inkeeping with the game. As, too, is the violence... a lot of violence, which may be off-putting for some.The plot is game-level generic with some predictable twists and turns, but it works really well in this format; it's not a preachy story with bad attempts at political commentary or subtext - it's a straight-up post-apocolyptic survival story, where few people are good or bad, but a blur of both as they struggle to survive in a ruined wasteland.I recommend it to fans of the game and to people who broadly like the genre.
0	The show is not worth the time you will spend watching it.The storytelling leaves you feeling confused, some concepts are introduced without setting any context, important things are happening to characters that have not been introduced properly, even after trying hard to care about what's going on in the series it feels impossible to do so because the characters are so superficial.Also, the casting choice is horrendous, some are well known actors who have done well in other movies/ shows but just don't fit in to their roles in this show.I haven't read the books so my opinion was not colored by how faithfully the book was adapted into the show. I found the show dreadfully unwatchable because of its own merits or should I say demerits.
2	Not a huge fan of the genre, but this show hooked me right from the start. Yes, lots of cliques like drinks at a bar after work, but I guess writers have to end episodes with a quieter setting, letting the audience unwind.Hopefully the quality of the show is maintained and they don't rely on too much character personal life, which is what spoils most crime shows for me.
0	This show could have gotten a high rating from me if not for those issues.First issue they speak Portugese in English. This is quite an issue as a Japanese who is learning Portugese is following an English conversation.... This is even hinted at from an early stage. I am English, but luckily for us all I am fluent in Portugese.The second issue is the style direction.Most of the times the backgrounds are blurred , this takes away the reality and as such my engagement. It often feels like most shots were made inside a studio.Japan is a very beautiful country so I think they missed a huge opportunity there.The minor issue is that the story is to convenient. The Macao incident is spoonfed to him while he is in prison. The fact that he is in prison is by chance and the person he meets there is by chance as well. He also was aware of Macao in some degree according to his diary. That as far as i watched hasnt been destroyed yet.There are more issues, he was just a navigator and he was picked without looking at any of the other sailors from the hull.This makes the entire story unbelievable and given the stylistic choice to blur the backgrounds this is more than a problem than it should be. I am constantly reminded this is just a cleverly written piece where everything falls together like a puzzle and not an account of what happened.I try not to use spoilers but I think I gave some. So this probably wont be read by anyone. If you read it, please rate it how you see fit. I think this was very close to being great but two choices were pretty bad.I finish episode 2. And unlike house of ninjas which also had plenty of issues i am not likely to finish this.
1	As a rabid fan of the games, I am happy to report that this show absolutely nails the lore and essence of fallout, right down to the obligatory shallow main plot.In defense of the series, the lore of this world has always been the draw, rather than some big main quest. There is always a cheap excuse to get you out of the vault, then you forget about that reason for 100+ hours while you make your own story. So how do you make that experience into a good non-interactive story? Beats me, but I think they did it as well as could be expected.The good: -Goggins' standout performance as Howard -The interplay between Max and Chet -Lore building surrounding VaultTecThe bad: -Fights feel more comical than high-stakes -Main villain is dull -All the MacGuffins, -Generally boring/unlikable protagonists.
0	It's been 15 years! The first 10 years were good even though I did get tired of so many disasters happening one after the other to the same people and same hospital... now its year 15 and it's just bad and extremely boring! There are no good characters left. Just end the show would ya!!
1	There are small parts of it that I liked. But very few. The pace is very uneven. All Japanese actors are fantastic and believable- doing the best with what they are given. There are two main issues. First - the writing is atrocious, formulaic, overly simplified and incoherent. The 2nd issue is the way Blackthorn character is written. He is neither the English gentleman nor the simpleton. Writers can't decide, and because of that his actions and words do not make sense most of the time and it is frustrating. Overall - overrated by about 3 points. Only 6/10 really. Watch 'The Last Samurai' Instead. A very similar story but well written, cohesive and overall a much better quality.
1	I have seen all Seasons but the 17 was the worst ever Season i have ever seen.Why must show be a complete Season of the pandemic?I know we have a pandemic but if i saw Series then i will switch off.
2	First of all, after three seasons, I really enjoy this show. It's got Nathan Fillion and a host of other likeable actors, and a decent story. It's fun, it's light and it always leaves me wanting more, as a good show should.That being said, the magic is constantly broken by their incessant need for female empowerment. As one character mentioned, women make up only about 12% of law enforcement and yet, in this show, they're over-represented to such an extent that one can't help but feel frustrated because they're always present, always right and always boring with their moral, intellectual and, often, physical superiority.Regardless of this issue, I do recommend this show to anyone looking for a bit of fun and distraction. I just wish they'd tone down the socio-political agenda to make it a bit more palatable.
0	"Some of the special effects are terrible, like the ship crashing. If you're going to slice people in half, go the extra mile and make it look believable. The storyline is interesting, but why make a shaky premise worse by hiring terrible actors to deliver the goods? Liam Cunningham, Jonathan Pryce, and Rosalind Chow know what they're doing, but the rest of the actors are awful. Who decided that Benedict Wong should be an actor? Or Eiza Gonzalez? Or Jovan Adepo? These actors are so unconvincing that I really don't care what happens to them. Also, since this is Netflix, only the young women characters are allowed to be geniuses, no middle aged men allowed because of the ""patriarchy"". Seriously, a twenty-something girl is the head of a research project probably costing somewhere in the millions of dollars. That's believable.Also, I find it hard to believe that an advanced civilization capable of interstellar travel and possessing knowledge beyond human comprehension is unable to find a more accommodating planet to travel to."
0	I am a huge fan of the 1983 mini series with Richard Chamberlain. He absolutely was John Blackthorrne. This FX series cannot begin to compare. It is tedious to watch. I am just an hour in and am giving up. If I want to read that much, I will read the book. This version seems to augment violence for violence's sake. Catholic bashing too which never sits well. They seemed to make a strong point of that early on. Volume is incredibly low, many scenes seen overly dark. Not as sumptuous as the original. I had this set as a series recording and deleted it after an hour in. It is rare that I ever like a remake. I think the only one that comes to mind was the A-Team movie. I spent most of the hour I watched not being able to truly concentrate because I had to read so much. I normally do not mind subtitles but this was painful. No thanks. I will now go buy the original.
0	First of all, I know I'm biased because I'm Portuguese, but in a show of this level hearing in Japanese that the next discussion would be in Portuguese and immediately the conversation is in English is simply a huge flaw for me. I really appreciate you putting on a show of this quality and dimension where Portugal is mentioned, and I obviously realize that for most people the dialogue that was supposed to be in Portuguese is actually in English, which makes no difference and only helps the show to flow and grow. However, it's still quite difficult for me to accept this fact. However, I will try to continue watching the show and try to ignore this (which I believe will be quite an impossible task). I hope no one is offended by this comment. Have a good day/night everyone. Thank you!
1	"Up until season 4, I was convinced nothing could or even would ever compare to Game of Thrones.After season 5, I thought ""OK, this one was a bit weaker, but they'll do better on the next one"".Season 6 came around and while it wasn't bad, it wasn't that good either. Great cinematography, sure, but that's because of the huge budget. The writing, on the other hand...Anyways, I was convinced that the writers would learn from their mistakes and give us a flawless season 7, on account of there being less episodes. I was wrong again. The writing was... catastrophic. Yet I still found myself enjoying the action scenes, once my brain was turned off.I told myself ""You know what, it can't possibly get any worse... right ?""Well... I was wrong. Not only is the last season almost ingeniously bad, it also destroyed all the build up from the first seasons.At least now I know it won't get worse than that. You know, because it's ended."
0	"This production is, in a word, dull. Just so dull. I do not like to use the word ""boring"" to criticize films, because I do not want to give the impression that I need movies to thrill me with scene after scene of snappy dialogue or car chases or shocking twists. But please, let's not let our film be dull. The production suffers from major missteps on several levels. First, the casting of Ripley is wrong. Let me say that Andrew Scott is one of The Most Brilliant Actors working in cinema and on stage today, but he is just (I think) too old for this part. Isn't Tom Ripley supposed to a contemporary of Dickie Greenleaf? (I haven't read the books, but I have always had the impression that they were close to each other in age.) His Ripley is so restrained. So grave. Which leads me to the next issue: the pacing of the film is so slow, it's downright lethargic. This wouldn't be a problem if there were any kind of energy or chemistry between the main characters, any kind of crackle to their interactions. But there just isn't. For someone who looks with such envious eyes on the privileged world that Greenleaf inhabits, Ripley does not seem to possess any refinement or worldly intelligence. His tastes are gauche. For me, this makes it a stretch to see him pulling off his schemes, petty though many of them are. The cinematography, though crisp and beautiful in black and white, adds to the rather sterile and soulless feel of the production. The one element of direction that I did find somewhat compelling was the use of gazes. Ripley gazing at Dickie's ring, for example. The postman looking at Ripley after he has asked an indiscreet question. Marge noticing Ripley covet Dickie's ring. Then there's the cat. (ha) I made it through the first three episodes, and I just don't care to continue."
1	I started watching this show not so long ago. The reason was that I fell in love with House and wanted something of the same type. From the early first season I understood that this show is not even close to what I wanted but still, I liked the atmosphere, jokes, some of the actors. So I watched this show evenings while cooking with a strong belief that I won't spend a night in front of the TV. Cause it was nice but not good enough to freeze me in temptation.I am not ready to draw an exact border, but from some point, the show started getting worse and worse with every single episode. Good characters kept dying, the level of play of the new ones kept falling down and the plot kept moving to a straight line of consequent troubles for the characters that are still alive.At first I was just skipping the scenes with characters I find dumb and unexciting to follow. Once I even watched 3 episodes in an hour, but from the 12th season I understood that I started skipping the dominant part. That's why I don't see the reason to continue watching this show.I would recommend watching the first 2-3 seasons and then stopping as if there was nothing further.
0	Ripley is clearly one of the most beautifully filmed B&W films, the sharp images, cinematography, lingering images and period settings are incredible. That's the positive which avoids a 1 star.Also being positive this version is closer to the book which portrays Ripley as a manipulative, controlling con artists which was lost in Matt Damon's character who was far more opportunistic.The rest , I don't where to start.Andrew Scott is just plan creepy, Dickie would have thrown him out after 10 minutes. Dickie is needy and there's no bond between the characters to indicate why he would invite Ripley to stay , other than them both being American.Dickie seems depressed and clearly not enjoying life in Italy, he would actually be happier in New York. He doesn't smile once in the whole film.The acting is stilted, dead pan from the rest of the cast ...just going through the motions. Marge is a zombie and I may be 55 but what the heck has Freddie become other than a PC icon.Not sure why they even went to San Remo other than to set up a murder.All in all watch the first episode for the gloss and sack the rest of it.Then watch the complex characters you can identify with, the high life , the drama , the colour of the film and enjoy it. I would have loved Minghella to have lived long enough to have the opportunity to explore the characters more in the form of a series of episodes.
2	The notion of a 45 year old man joining the LAPD as a rookie shouldn't work but good writing and a great cast makes all the difference. Nathan Fillion as the titular character has a likeability factor not unlike Jimmy Stewart or James Garner that helps make his earnestness believable. The story focuses on three rookies who went through the academy together and their training officers. The cast is great and the writing gives them much to work with. Each episode will go from humorous to nerve racking to tragic and makes it all believable.
2	This show is great and each episode is better and better. All these negative comments on season 3 appear to be right wingers/trumpers. This complaining about the political agenda of season 3 is so much whining! I think the show is getting better and better as it finds it footing and voice. Excellent show!
1	I started watching this show when I was in Medical school. As a 40+ yo (went late in life) I loved this and House. Watched until last season as it just became unbearably preachy. If you want to watch the show then start with Season 1 and be prepared for it to be great through about season 5 or 6. When some of the originals start to leave it starts to be less interesting. Sad thing is I have liked alot of the characters over the years but Shonda has started to get too preachy (in her other shows as well). At this point I pretty much cant watch anything she makes which is sad because I liked her earlier work....
1	What used to be a great drama that brought you into the world of surgery that gave you characters you liked, rooted for, turned into a woke, agenda based, soap cliché. Where the medical drama aspect was the focus is now not even a factor. Now surgeries are a chance to play the newest pop song and blast through it. I hate the new interns and residents they dont have the charm or personality. They are stock characters to fill in their quota. I heard Meredith was leaving & it's safe to say where it started with her this show should've ended with her. I can say the last 4-5 seasons have been the worst & dragged this show to bottom. In the beginning this show was 10/10 for me. But now the last few seasons have dragged this down to a sad 5/10 I haven't looked forward to an episode in a long time. What was entertainment is now a chore.
0	I have no idea why this show is getting great reviews. The writing is like nails on a chalkboard. The dialogue doesn't flow. It seems needlessly wordy, like they're trying to make such huge points. But interactions can't be powerful if *every* interaction is trying to be powerful. It looks like actors reciting lines rather than genuine, believable relationships.The main character has an internal monologue and it's so cringy. It reminds me of the flowery language of a high school poetry class. The camera always does tight shots on the guy's face, many per episode. I get that it's to show he's thinking deeply about whatever it is, but it is so heavy handed. They couldn't come up with another device to show his emotional struggle?It was boring and felt amateurish. Yet another show trying to be edgy by covering 'shocking' topics and failing in skill and substance à la Saltburn.
2	"1st episode opens with ""This is a true story,"" and the series starts off with what you think will be a run of the mill stalking story, but it goes so much deeper than that. In the first few episodes, you find yourself extremely frustrated with the main character, and some of the decisions he makes, but as the series moves on, it really sheds incredible insight, and truly explains his decisions and thoughts that earlier had you screaming at the TV at him, maybe like me you screamed at him and calling him, ""an idiot!"" I watched the whole series in one day, and it definitely did not ever drag on, it deals with some Very disturbing content so if you are really sensitive to things that causes people major trauma, viewer beware. They don't Show anything graphic in nature like violence or anything of that sort, but the implications are and Richard Gadd's performance truly captured the raw emotion of the trauma that is a result of everything that he goes through. It really is a great story and now I'm going to do a little research to see how much of this ""true story,"" is accurate."
2	I'm very impressed by this series. Each episode left me wanting more and now I want to know when season 2 will be released. Not perfect by any means and I wish they'd gone into more depth in the scientific aspects. Never read the books but now I definitely want to. The amount of action, suspense and science captured my attention. This series is great for the SyFy community and I recommend it to everyone. Don't be like others and start with negativity. Go into this with an open mind, put yourself in their shoes and experience what is the 3 Body Problem. While this series isn't a perfect ten, it merits the time for 8 episodes with the desire to know more.
0	"A Song of Ice and Fire is a series of fast-paced fantasy epics by novelist George R.R. Martin. With a total of 4,451 pages so far, it took me a little over a month to read. It's an exciting parade of plot twists and prophecies, and explores a rich secondary world with all its cultures and history through the points of view of a diverse cast of characters.""Game of Thrones"" is an HBO television series based on those books. It has lasted six seasons so far, and each one feels like an eternity. It is pedantic, talkative, static, and predictable. The progress of its narrative mirrors the structure of its opening theme music: circular, monotonous, and endlessly repetitive. Its plot twists take the form of stabbings, beheadings, and betrayals, but for all their apparent randomness they arrive at regular intervals -- when things are going well for a character, you know his throat will be slit by the end of the episode.The novels were told from the points of view of its main characters, and its perspective broadened with each book, illuminating new corners of the world of Westeros and shedding new light on what's gone before. Reading the books is an experience of ongoing revelation. We gradually come to understand the story's villains, and that understanding engenders our sympathy. The show is more direct. Everything is laid bare, and the characters are transformed into cogs in the convoluted machinery of the plot. The net result is that none of the characters are truly sympathetic; we can only watch the show objectively, without really caring about what happens to anyone. All men must die, and all GoT characters will commit terrible deeds for selfish ends.Stylistically, the show is bewilderingly dull. When the tension should be ratcheting up, Tyrion and his brother Jaime pause for a conversation about their mentally challenged cousin. Littlefinger and Varys, the show's resident Machiavellian schemers, regularly deliver expository speeches. Other characters proclaim their motives out loud, while still others happily announce things that everyone should already know. It creates the singular impression that the scripts are ninety percent filler. The gears of the plot keep inexorably turning, and the writers struggle to keep up."
1	This just wasn't my cup of tea. I'm not going to spoil anything but this guy just makes bad decision after bad decision and it's hard to watch. As a film, it's oddly boring at times despite the plot line. Half hour episodes sometimes feel like hours. I know people are giving this good reviews, but if you don't like troubled lives with drawn out story telling, pass on this.I suppose the only unique thing this has to offer is that the actor is the actual real life Donny. So it may draw you in for that reason, but I just didn't care whatsoever. I kept wanting to shout WHAT ARE YOU DOING??!!! And keep in mind despite Martha being a central figure in this show, his bad decisions go well beyond and with others. Intrigued? Try it. But don't say I didn't warn you that it's irritating more than entertaining.
1	Started off as the greatest series of all time, but had the worst ending of all time.
2	"I started watching this show because I was curious about the game - which I've never played - and also because it has a good rating.Well, the first season is done and I finished watching it in two days. It's that interesting. The plot twists and story keep you hooked from the get-go, and the character arcs keep you guessing what our heroes will do next.For example, ""the ghoul"" starts off as a cool dude, then does some shady ""surfies"" stuff, and then slowly becomes an anti-hero figure. Of all the characters, he is probably my favorite because of his complete lack of correctness.There is a romantic side to the story, which I don't much care for, but I guess you can't have your cake and eat it, too.Definitely looking forward to season 2. And yes, I do recommend watching this if you like sci-fi with a healthy serving of bloodshed."
2	I have never watched anything in full black-and-white before, so at first I was a bit not into it, but as the show goes on, I think it's an interesting artistic choice. It added a layer of grit and atmosphere, giving a shadowy noir tone to the story. The visuals are a gorgeous play in shadow and light.Now, the pacing is somewhat slow. While it's clearly intentional and may appeal to some, it's not really my thing.The casts and the supporting casts all did an amazing job. The production and the location setups are also amazing. The plot of the show is a nice thrilling mix of mystery and suspense.
1	It's not the best, and it's not the worst. It does get better with each episode, and Nathan Fillion is Nathan Fillion. If you are a fan of his, the show is worth it. The body cam aspect of the show is really cool, almost like The film End Of Watch the way it's shot. I'll watch the second season 7.6/10
0	"Yes, you can completely ruin a show with a terrible ending, and that is what GOT will be forever remembered for: the worst final season of all time. An ending so bad, it ruins the rewatchability of the show. Let me start off by saying, I was as big of a fan of the show and the books as you could possibly be. I finished the books in 2012, and since have reread most of them. I have watched season 1-6 more times than I even feel comfortable admitting. I wanted to pour my disappointment into a beautifully written polemic, but instead, I am going to put as much effort into the rest of this review as Benioff and Weiss did into the final season:Stupid story, arcs ruined, plots abandoned, rush rush rush, every character takes stupid pills, okay let's wrap this up already, fight fight, cgi, okay we're done. Screw you nerds, let's go get that sweet Star Wars and Netflix money.BTW, I find it odd people are still doing ""Spoiler Alerts"" three months after a series has ended. Here is a spoiler alert for you, season 8 spoils the entire series."
0	"Its so slow, i had to watch it on 1.5x speed. It would be okay if the show had some semblance of tension or interest, but it doesnt, all it has is annoying and bland characters. I cant remember any of their names, and all their problems seem so trivial, and they completely ignore the one problem that actually seems important. Theyre stereotypes of 'the genius scientist' like the guy who constantly says things like ""its a deepfake"" as if a scientist would ever believe someone could deepfake the STARS BLINKING GLOBALLY. Like seriously? And that asian girl actually thinking its a VR game like are these characters stupid? Anyone would figure out that that weird helmet thingy is not a simple VR game. Some 'genius' particle scientist."
0	"On the technical level, its just fine. The effects and CG aren't anything to write home about, the gore is as excessive as it ought to be considering the source material, and most of the visuals are OK. Decent. That said, as far as the source material goes, it's utterly creatively bankrupt and completely uninspired. It's taken every little prop from the game (Fallout 4, seemingly the only entry in the franchise they seem to care much about despite being located on the opposite end of the country geographically) and brought it into the show, which at first was fun to see, but QUICKLY got old. The visuals can be summarized as ""Fallout 4 but a show."" Todd Howard is an absolutely talentless hack.The casting is bad. Walton Goggins has a good performance and plays the only redeeming character with any depth. The actors chosen for many of the vault dwellers are at times viscerally unpleasant to watch, with no payoff to their awful personalities and bizarre decision making. The lead actress is unremarkable and bland, and somehow manages to both be pitiful and a Mary Sue at the same time.Honestly I regret watching this, and have already thrown in the towel with Amazon Prime as a whole because of the shallow garbage they've been putting out lately."
1	Season 8 ruined the complete series. Till Season 6 it was a 10/10
0	After seeing three episodes, I can say this is a huge disappointment. None of the major characters look or feel like a scientist... they seem not to care about things that were not making sense... just spend days hanging out with friends in a bar. It is so obvious that none of them actually care about science. Apparently, the writers are better at writing three body love triangles than three body physics problems.it is both awful adaption /writing and awful casting. I bet none of them spend enough time understanding basic physics..It feels another cool kids save the world type of show. Don't waste your time. It's at best mediocre.
0	It seems that an eternity has passed , especially after the departure of Derek and Mark from the series. It's not even a medical soap opera anymore, it has basically become a medical circus where actors and actresses get paid for doing nothing, dreaming, kissing and performing stupid and unbelievable medical stuff.It pains me to write these, cause I was once a true fan of the series. The producers stretched it thin so much that it snapped a few seasons back without them noticing it. Cancel it already and if you have so much money to waste, at least think of a new worthy series, whatever it might be, with fresh and new ideas.Viewers scores (true or not) and fake popularity after two digits seasons are not everything. Respect yourself and your true viewers and admirers. They are the ones who count the most...
2	I Just completed the episode that aired March 22. So glad to see a strong and serious episode without the recent silliness that I found highly disappointing and unfortunately more reflective of Rookie Fed. I was seriously aggravated by the honeymoon episode. The idea was good. How it played out was boring. This show has excellent actors who deserve an excellent script. The storyline was solid, the emotions of the actors, both the officers and the perpetrators, were real and skillfully portrayed. This show was the quality that I expect as a dedicated viewer from season 1, episode 1. Well done. I look forward to the next show.
0	"For all the hype, this was a pathetic series that drug on & on only b/c of the many non-thinkers there are out there who think this kind of thing is actually humorous/entertaining. Oh, that was all I had to say actually, but when I tried to submit this it actually says there's a ""guideline"" requiring TEN lines, or... it's simply not enough. So, here I am just typing blah blah blah to fill up 10 lines b/c I truly do think somebody needs to call out that the emperor has no clothes on some of these idiotic shows that are called ""intelligent"" by those who require very little to amuse themselves. Even the acting was atrocious for the most part, but the plots? Dumb."
0	Where do I even begin with this disaster of a TV series? 'Fallout' is an absolute travesty that manages to squander every ounce of potential it had. From the poorly written dialogue to the laughable special effects, it's clear that the creators had no clue what made the original video game franchise so beloved.Let's start with the acting, or lack thereof. The performances are so wooden and uninspired that you'd think the cast was made up of department store mannequins. Not even the most talented actors could salvage the atrocious script they were given. Every line feels forced and devoid of any emotion, leaving viewers cringing in their seats.And don't even get me started on the production quality. The sets look like they were thrown together in someone's backyard, complete with cheap props and shoddy costumes. The CGI is so bad that it's almost comical, with mutant creatures resembling poorly rendered blobs rather than terrifying monstrosities.But perhaps the most unforgivable sin of 'Fallout' is how it completely misses the mark on capturing the essence of the video games. Gone is the sense of exploration and discovery, replaced instead with mind-numbingly dull plotlines and tedious exposition. It's as if the creators took everything that made the games great and tossed it out the window in favor of generic post-apocalyptic clichés.In conclusion, 'Fallout' is a train wreck of a TV series that should be avoided at all costs. Save yourself the agony and stick to playing the video games instead. At least then you'll have some semblance of enjoyment amidst the nuclear fallout of this abysmal adaptation.
0	Sadly the excellent decoration is met with mediocre writing and brutal bad playing. The inability to grasp the hidden message, strange narrative just ot make thing clearer for a lazy brain. It is far away form the mystique, elegance and internal conflicts of the 80's series. The behavior is fully Americanized , the Japanese orientalism is fully depreciated. The actors play mediocre too, some lost their accent, some cannot grasp the internal conflict of the invisible. I was wondering why specific scenes are shoot just to make clearer what happens, where the master of the puppet will never have such conversations.
0	"What a let down. The first two season are great. Some easy viewing, with decent acting, likable characters, a properly done diverse cast, Nathan Fillion, a decent mix between funny, serious and heart felt. Everyone brings something to the table, and believe it or not...nobody blames anything on race or gender for the entire first two seasons.Then season three rolls around and ruins everything. Now don't get me wrong, race and gender prejudice exist. And some shows do a really good job in tackling these issues. The Rookie does not!Two of our cops do a support program in a black neighborhood. A young black man breaks a car window and steals something. They catch him, but the bystanders have little praise because ""just another black man in handcuffs"". As the cops try to shine a light on the fact that this man committed a crime, and someone in this poor neighborhood now has a broken car window they need to fix, no one agrees, its still the cops fault for...whatever reason.As a former contractor, Nathan Fillions character puts in some work to fix up a local playground for kids. Instead of ANY recognition for good deed, or at least a good intention, he gets nothing but angry complaints, because the lights he fixed (the broken lights were a reason it was too dangerous for kids) now only attract meth dealers.Yeah...and that is his fault how? The people told him the lights are broken and thats a problem, now the working lights are a problem.No matter what he does, he always gets the blame, and the show makes this seem ok. Even his POC coworker, who until this point had never made a single comment about race prejudice stabs him in the back, always taking the other peoples side, regardless of how illogical it seems.There is a racist cop, a sexist doctor and many more ""problematic characters"", all of these things exist IRL, no question. But the way the are handled here is just paint by numbers lazy writing. No depth, no semblance of realism, just tropes and cliches, to show how bad the world treats women and minorities. Despite a vast number of the upper police Ranks being ethnic.And of course as an older white man, Nathan Fillion has never experienced any of these injustices in his life (despite him literally having heart of gold and a strong sense of justice, as former seasons keep pointing out), so he gladly takes in all these lessons on how its his fault people are criminals.4 Stars only because the two first seasons are good. But the third is barely watchable."
2	It was definitely worth watching if you like science fiction. It's not the best sci-fi but it's mid-to high level. It's different than most sci-if movies/tv shows. I did not read the book so I had no idea what to expect. It has a little lull in the middle, when they are doing the AI headset game, so don't let that kick you off, just hold out and after that part, the puzzle pieces start coming together. It's almost, and maybe it is b/c I didn't read the book, alternative world/reality type with the science stuff in the beginning; it had me a little confused at first. The ending didn't leave you hanging too bad, but enough for a season 2.
0	For the most part great cast. Good follow through with character situations. Hated to see Afton williamson leave.
1	"I only saw the first episode, and while it's generally very good, with good acting and a slow but engaging storyline, I have to point out one very obvious fault...It's obviously set in Japan in the 1600's, so the local characters speak japanese, and the foreign ship crew, a mix of dutch and english sailors speaking english. There's also spanish character that speaks with a spanish accent.So far, so good.The problem is the show has a lot to deal with the portuguese presence in Japan, and as such, several dialogues are supposed to be in portuguese, but in the show they're portrayed in english.I obviously know this is to create a better appeal to american and english-speaking audiences, but why do you have japanese speaking japanese, but no portuguese speaking portuguese?It can't state to be a grand production, with historically accurate costumes and storyline, and be so ""americanized"" at the same time!Other than that, I enjoyed the first episode and will probably follow with the next ones, though hoping there's a bit more action."
1	The reason I needed to stop was the stupidity of the main character. There were times all he had to do was say something to avoid a catastrophic escalation but instead sat like a stunned mullet. Personally, I always feel that reflects weak writing. I also found it quite embarrassing that the writer claims to be a comedian. Not sure if the aim of the series was to make it as uncomfortable as possible to watch or of the writer is genuinely not funny.The silver lining for me was Martha, I got really involved with her character and the acting was superb. The fear I felt at times was genuine and she made the show for me.The overall story is very sad, it brought back memories of my early teens when I was groomed by an older man, a situation that I now realise I have never processed.I would recommend this to other people but would warn them it isn't an easy watch.
0	ABC turns winners into losers.Why?Cost? PC? Woke? Or is it mental illness.Are Game shows more cost effective?Or is this LA post-Covid?Or do they just hate entertainment?
1	"The period where the TV show follows the books are really incredible, but beyond that point they've gone ""Hollywood"" and used all the old TV tropes, the lack of which made the first five seasons so refreshing."
1	Loving this series, like HBO quality.OMG its so JAPAN! And so authentic(at least cinema authentic!).No idea how realistic it is or if its nothing but exaggerations for the screen, its awesome!The story is really well done, the characters are great, but the dialogue, its just absolutely amazing. Again, very similar to something HBO would produce.Apparently this is a remake or novel adaptation or something...couldnt care less its still great!The only downside is the main character...annoying, loud, stupid and literal savage in every sense of the word, and this includes the actor.Kinda over the 'white guy goes to japan and saves it' cliche.
0	"I really liked this show at first. Huge Nathan Fillion fan since I first saw him on Buffy, and he never disappoints. His support cast is also mostly excellent, leading mid-40's LAPD recruit John Nolan through his personal crucible.However, the longer the show goes on, the less of a rookie John Nolan becomes. Eventually he is elected Union Representative or something. At that point the show loses its identity, funny as the election campaign against Smitty may have been.They completely lost me in season 4 with the ""wrongly accused"" plot. The idea is interesting, but the character involved is so unlikable that I was rooting for him to fail at life and everything. I just wanted the garbage to end.TL;DR: Season 1-3 watchable, season 4 was my last.Sorry Nathan."
2	Very good start to this show. Most people hate reading subtitles. But to me, I'd rather have an authentic show with the characters speaking their native tongue. So which is why I couldn't give it a better score because the Spanish are speaking English. The story is great, It gives a game of thrones type of vibe. 5 families running Japan but there is always that 1 family above em all that doesn't want to be on top but it is their destiny. Not to mention the main character is English. His mission is to discover Japan which he heard stories about the Spaniards discovering Japan and keeping the country a secret from the rest of the world in a time where Spain and Europe are at war.
2	"This is not for the feint hearted. To think this is a real thing that goes on is quite terrifying. Some pretty powerful stuff. This should not be judged by first impressions or hype, stick with it, it should just be watched and then researched. Gadd is destined for massive things after this performance, truly powerful. The front cover sort of makes it look like a cheap slasher movie or something but it is actually a deep psychological drama about mental health and drugs and general scumbag-ness in the ""industry"". A rollercoaster or bleak then slightly less bleak situations. Think twice before getting into showbiz!"
1	I highly recommend you avoid this show given how bad the ending was. It literally ruined the series if you're a Dany fan. If you don't care about Dany at all, then by all means watch on. If you care about Dany and all she went through, then avoid this show. They destroy her character in the final two episodes and make her entire journey worthless and pointless.Dany fans, you have been warned.
2	"I don't believe there has ever been anything like 'Game of Thrones' on TV. The sheer amount of quality and talent in this series is staggering. The actors (and I mean really ALL the actors), the costumes, the visual effects, the make-up: everybody working on this show seems to have wanted to make Television-history. And the writing is just phenomenal.'Game of Thrones' may belong to the 'Fantasy' genre, but the world of Westeros and its surrounding lands has been so amazingly well thought through and is inhabited by characters that are so well drawn and credible that everything you watch feels real. Every ""country"", every city, tribe or family has such a richly detailed history and even mythology that it just never feels like it was made up. Of course, that was all already there in the books – but translating that so perfectly to a TV-show and with such care as was done here really is a rare achievement.Yet for all its grandeur, scale and breath-taking visuals, what really makes Martin's outstanding work come to life on the small screen is the fantastic ensemble of actors. At the core of this show (any show, really) are the characters. Tyrion, Cersei, Dany, Jamie and John (and all the – many – others) don't lose anything of their complexity; the amazing cast succeeds in showing all their respective characters' inner conflicts and often questionable motivations and virtually no one comes across as one-dimensional (except maybe for Joffrey).There have been a couple of great TV-shows over the last years, but when it comes to scale AND quality, 'Game of Thrones' is – at the moment – in a league of its own. A joy to watch: breath-taking, epic – and highly addictive – Television. 10 stars out of 10.Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
2	I will say that this still a great TV show and one you should still watch but, man that last season was really bad.
1	So many cop drama's on TV lately this is one I really like. Nathan Fenian plays a character who's starting his life over again and is way behind the rest of the police department as far as he's older than everyone. It's smart and funny we'll acted and a new take on the same old story. The story line is well balanced and the cast of characters are well-acted and made me actually care about the people whom the played.
0	First of all I'm not a fan of the franchise but I like the first two games and New Vegas. I couldn't care less about they ruining this franchise further as nothing can ruin the aforementioned Fallout video games for me anyway.The story basically doesn't exist. It's not much different than Fallout 3's story. The whole point of the TV Series is just watching Fallout-themed media and remembering the good old days of playing the video games, not to actually enjoy a TV series to watch. In that regard I would say it's low-quality fan media but I can't because Fallout: Nuka Break and Fallout: Red Star is way better than this TV series for a fan content. So it makes this TV series just a greedy tool to milk a franchise in the worst way possible content.That being said if you are not familiar with the Fallout franchise I don't think things would make sense as there is zero care for a new audience to Fallout. For example I don't think anyone who didn't played the video games can actually understand what's a vault nor what kind of setting this version of world is in this TV series.Despite the aim of making you remember Fallout there was a little from the video games. It's more like they took the fundamentals and they did their own things. There is not even single super mutant but briefly mentioned around end of the season. The only familiar enemy was mutant cockroaches, bear and feral ghouls and that's it. As for weapon only pistol, assault rifle laser rifle was familiar. There is Vault stuff, Nuka Cola and its caps, some foods, Brother of Steel, NCR Ranger outfit, mention of Enclave and that's all about there to see from video games.Basically 2 episodes of content stretched to 8 episodes so yeah every episode is too slow and long. Some of the dialogues are so ridiculous I hope they used an AI because I don't wanna think a person was mentally okay and was good with this. IDK if there will be a 2nd season but sure as hell I ain't watching it. If I wasn't free I would stop at 1st episode instead watching the whole season.Instead of unnecessary nudity it would be great if there was necessary Fallout gore. The gore there is is not enough for a Fallout media. I would wanna see V. A. T. S. targeting at least in one combat but I guess they didn't actually play any of the video games.There are two good things I can say about this tv series. First is very famous actors and actresses plays in it and second is sometimes hearing music from the video games in the right time. Other than these there is no redeeming quality whatsoever.
2	I wasn't really sure what to expect going into Sugar, I wasn't familiar with the story at all but Colin Farrell was starring in it so I was definitely going to at least give it a chance. I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed it. Anytime a A-list actor like Farrell does a tv show I'm usually going to give it a chance because if it's good enough to get a big name like that it must be worth watching. There are a ton of detective shows to choose from out there, it seems like even more so this year, so a show must be good enough to stick out from the bunch to get people to watch and Sugar is. The acting & writing aren't the only good things going for this show, it's also beautifully shot. It has a real stylish throwback to classic noir films to it. Bottom line, Sugar is worth your time.
1	Andrew Scott is a great actor but for me he was miscast as Ripley. If you can't bring in someone as charismatic as Alain Delon's Ripley (but honesty who can beat that) or as ambivalent as Matt Damon's Ripley, because Matt Damon's Ripley really got us with his innocent, studious look and yet callous presence, just please don't cast an actor who definetely cannot project a certain sense of naivity, misleading innocence, error of youth, elegance or irresistable charm (and not just plain charm) all of which are also an undelible part of Ripley's character.For a black and white Andrew Scott reinforces the creepiness of Ripley but Ripley is about much more than creepiness, cruelty, arrogance or emotional distance and this just doesn't get you to feel for Ripley the way Alain Delon did (we were even hoping for Delon's Ripley to get away with it). It pains me because he is an outstanding theatre actor and was the best Moriarty ever. That being said, if you have never watched the previous two adaptations or read any of Highsmith's books this might work quite well for you but otherwise this is honetsly simplistic and one dimensional Ripley.In all fairness, they could have done a different show with Andrew Scott along the lines of the character he is playing but this should have been an original script and certainly not a Highsmith's adaptation.
2	...And soaps can go on for generations. Just look at All My Children (40+ years) and The Bold and the Beautiful (36 years) and General Hospital since 1963! Let go of expecttions of more and it's an interesting show without cops and violence. That's a big plus in my book. All that being said, I've watched the entire series several times from the beginning and I still strongly and intensely dislike Dr Robbins. What a whiny, self-centered, egotistical character. (I've often wondered if the writers have a friend or family member they've used as a template for her.) All the rest of the characters with their eccentricities I've enjoyed or at least understood on some level. But she is just a royal pain in the a$$. But I'll keep watching because it is entertaining enough that I come back each season and everyone isn't killing each other. Major kudos for those from the original cast for hanging in there.
2	With so many cop shows out there, you would think they would run out of ideas. Well this is definitely a new take on the cop show and I like it. I have only watched the pilot but I am definitely sticking around for more. Check it out for yourselves.
2	"Old fan of the greatest Sci-Fi author of all, I found this story in the same league. This won't appeal to Trekkies and Star Wars fans I'm afraid - too ""cerebral"". The characters are absolutely believable and very-well cast.I love how they worked in connected particle ideas for being able to spy on us from more than 400 light years away.And there's that absolutely fascinating idea about how one race might attempt to solve its own existential problems at the expense of another race, and how that might play out in the REAL universe. I loved the other race using a VR game to explain to us why they had to invade our planet, as if this would make it all ok.I also loved the invaders informing us they were coming at nearly the speed of light and would be here in 400 yrs.So perfectly Asimovian!"
0	How could anyone think it is a good show is beyond me.The writing is very poor. Predictable and ridiculous. Nothing is accurate, it's hard to watch.The main character is a white male dating only younger women who look like models. Actually they all look like they are coming from a model agency, it is not representative of the real world.This is so tiring to see that these kind of show is what people want.With a budget like this they could do so much better.As for the Comedy, is it supposed to be funny???I can understand that sometimes we all need to watch sthg light but the inaccuracy and stupidity is unbearable.
2	Don't get me wrong. I still watch grey's anatomy till this day, but one thing I can't get over is how much this show has changed since Shonda Rhimes left as show runner and Krista Vernoff took the reins. Some of the story lines are simply repetitive. In my opinion Jackson Avery has no story left telling after April was written off the show. Owen is one of the worst characters to ever exist. I truly hate his hypocritical views. Arizona and April leaving was a HUGE mistake in my opinion. They both had interesting stories worth telling. The way Alex Karev went back to his toxic ex wife as a way to explain Justin Chambers leaving the show was insane. Was there no other way of ending his story in a better situation??? Meredith is like a cat. She's like on her 6th life. Can't tell if she's actually going to make it out of this COVID19 story line. Joe is just a good character that no longer has a meaning after Alex was written off the show. Miranda is there because she has to. She's the chief. Great. Dr. Webber aswell, he's just around. There is not much a personal story to follow from his perspective. Jackson's mom is around because she owns the hospital. Idk. I just think it's time for this show that has given us so much good tv to come to an end. And I give it a 8 because even though I don't like some aspects about this show it still enjoy watching it!!
2	9-9.5? No. We'll see how it progresses, but it's solid so far. I'm also a big fan of the original mini-series and this this one has A LOT to live up to. We'll see how they compare over the course of the series, but they've certainly favoured noticeable CGI over authenticity in some locations and 'camera' shots. If I had a gripe through 2 episodes it would be the portrayal of female characters. IMO, the series has ignored the status of women - even those of higher status - in feudal Japan in favour of a more contemporary portrayal. If you haven't seen the original, I recommend you do. Melodramatic period style aside, it's really expansive and epic.
0	"A Frustrating Symphony of Missed PotentialThe allure of Cixin Liu's ""Three-Body Problem"" trilogy is undeniable. Imagine a world scrambling to prepare for an impending alien invasion, fueled by a chaotic, physics-bending message from a distant civilization. This captivating premise drew me to the Netflix adaptation, ""3 Body Problem,"" with eager anticipation. However, the series ultimately falls short, becoming a frustrating symphony of missed potential plagued by narrative choices that leave the viewer bewildered and irritated.A Story Drowning in Exposition Dumps:The show's greatest flaw lies in its pacing and storytelling structure. Instead of immersing viewers in the escalating tension and paranoia of the impending alien threat, the narrative gets bogged down in lengthy exposition dumps. Characters deliver monologues filled with scientific jargon and historical references, leaving the audience feeling like they're attending a crash course on astrophysics rather than watching a sci-fi drama. These information dumps often feel inorganic, disrupting the emotional flow and hindering character development.Characters Reduced to Mouthpieces for Exposition:Speaking of characters, the show fails to truly flesh them out. They become mere vessels for delivering the dense scientific concepts and historical backdrop. Their motivations, personalities, and emotional journeys remain underdeveloped. We see glimpses of potential in characters like Ye Wenjie, the astrophysicist wrestling with guilt and disillusionment, or Wang Miao, the bewildered nanomaterials researcher thrust into a world of conspiracies. However, these intriguing possibilities are never fully explored, leaving the viewer emotionally detached from their struggles.A Disconnect Between Visuals and Narrative:The show's visual effects are undeniably impressive. The depiction of the Trisolaran fleet, their warped physics, and the devastating societal collapse are visually stunning. However, these impressive visuals often feel disconnected from the narrative. They don't enhance the emotional impact of the story, instead serving as flashy distractions from the show's deeper themes of societal upheaval and humanity's place in the universe.Irritating Narrative ChoicesBeyond the structural issues, a series of baffling creative decisions further hamper the show's potential. The constant shifts between timelines, particularly the jarring jumps to the Cultural Revolution period, feel unnecessary and disrupt the narrative flow. Additionally, the show's reliance on convenient plot devices, such as conveniently timed character encounters or sudden bursts of convenient knowledge, leave a sour taste.A Glimmer of Hope, Lost in Frustration:Despite its shortcomings, the series does have its moments. The exploration of the societal impact of the Trisolaran threat, with its paranoia and fracturing world order, holds promise. There are also glimpses of a more character-driven narrative, particularly in the portrayal of Wang Miao's personal struggles. However, these fleeting moments are ultimately overshadowed by the show's frustrating reliance on exposition and its underdeveloped characters.Conclusion: A Symphony of Missed Notes""3 Body Problem"" is a show brimming with ambition but ultimately fails to deliver on its potential. The narrative drowns in exposition, the characters lack depth, and puzzling creative choices leave the viewer frustrated rather than engaged. While the visuals are impressive and the premise captivating, the show ultimately feels like a missed opportunity to create a truly compelling sci-fi drama. For those seeking a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant exploration of an alien invasion, ""3 Body Problem"" might leave you feeling like you've just sat through a frustrating symphony of missed notes."
0	As expected, this is nothing but the typical easily palatable generic theme park ride version of Fallout, akin to a bethesda game so in that sense, it is the perfect video game adaptation.Its boring, predictable and everything looks cheap, developers just need to copy the general iconography of the series and remix its narrative elements into a formulaic narrative for the masses.Art is divisive, this is not art but trash. It deserves a 3, but for the sake of scale tipping, it gets a one. Something like this is only possible in a world where visual iliteracy is at an all-time high and i dream of what would be possible if fallout and other projects, film or otherwise, were made with artistic freedom and intention.
1	Seasons 1 through 3 were AMAZING. 10/10. Seasons 4 through 7 became slow and felt lacking in direction at times, but there were hints of it starting to come back which kept me invested. Season 8 was so awful that I can no longer call myself a Game of Thrones fan.Season 8 introduced continuity errors and lazy writing. Worse still, the central theme that was established in the very first episode of the series and built up throughout the whole show was concluded in the THIRD episode of the last season in the most anti-climactic way I have ever seen!However, I don't think we should be *too* hard on Season 8. After all, it has saved me hundreds of dollars on a Blu-Ray box set, merchandise and celeb autographs at conventions. I can't think of any other TV show that has saved me money by watching it.How I calculated my score:S1: 10 S2: 10 S3: 10 S4: 5 S5: 5 S6: 5 S7: 5 S8: -10= 40 / 8 = 5
0	The show should have ended when Shonda left. Now it's time to wrap it up
0	Loved the first two seasons and was eagerly awaiting season 3, third season not starting off well, I'd like to think my cop shows are at least somewhat believable and rooted in reality, yes I know its a work of fiction but come on. I'm hanging in there because Nathan is my favorite TV actor but thinking even Nathan can't save the direction this show is going.
0	Season 8 of game of thrones has been the most Pathetic and underwhelming season.
2	First 6 seasons of this show are peak primetime television. They're absolutely brilliant and I can watch them over and over again. The standouts are absolutely season 2 and season 5. The characters are incredible and the tension and love between them, for the most part, is extremely well written. The development of the characters mixed in with the medical setting makes for a really solid show. Seasons 7 and 8 of the show were good, but I usually end my rewatch of it after the season 6 finales. Seasons 9 and 10 were ok, and after that, it's not even worth it anymore. Just end it already, I don't even know how it's still going on.
2	"Sugar is a commendable series that skillfully incorporates elements of classic hardboiled detective stories into a contemporary setting. The show strikes a balance between paying homage to the genre's traditions and adapting them for today's audience.The lead character, reminiscent of the archetypal private eye, brings a certain charm and authenticity to the role, making the series engaging for both aficionados of the genre and new viewers. The dialogue is sharp, and the plot is well-crafted, with enough twists to maintain interest without being overly complex.The modern take on the genre is evident in the show's approach to character diversity and social issues, which adds depth and relevance to the narrative. The visual style nods to the noir roots while maintaining a current aesthetic that suits the show's tone.Overall, ""Sugar"" is a solid series that offers a fresh take on the detective genre, and it's worth watching for its clever writing, strong performances, and thoughtful update of classic tropes."
0	One joke show. The dude is old. We get it. Not interesting. Standard characters. The hard ass cop, the jerk copy, the kiss ass cop, the upwardly mobile cop etc. I had a hard time finishing the first episode. I like Nathan Fillion so this was a big disappointment.
0	8 seasons of nothing Winter was coming for 8 seasons; winter came, and winter ended in 40 minutes
1	The Rookie's premise is simple enough; a series about rookie police officers where one of them is a forty-something guy struggling to prove himself.The first episode hits all the expected marks. Seasoned veterans screwing with the rookies as they plot to rise in the ranks. Humor mixed with drama. A little tragedy. Hints at back stories.Was anything genuinely surprising? Not really. Deeply moving? Nope. But it's all pretty watchable. The acting is solid, the thing is well filmed (although the cop-cam shots don't add much), the script flows well.For me, this falls in the category of shows-I'd-watch-if-there-wasn't-so-much-TV-to-choose-from. It's all fine, but I feel no need to watch any more.
1	It's about what you'd expect from trailer, just really forgettable and bland. It's not bad, but it certainly isn't good. Without Fillion, this show would probably have been cancelled mid season, but he's too entertaining to not be on TV.
2	The main character Blackthorne looks like a low IQ dolt. I can't stand his limp cry baby facial expressions, but for the rest, the series is eminently watchable. Still, the original with legendary actor Richard Chamberlain was much better. Overall one say the Japanese cast performed better than the Europeans. One of the series' greatest strengths is its exploration of cultural differences and the clash of civilizations between East and West. Through the eyes of Blackthorne, viewers gain insight into the intricacies of Japanese society, from its strict hierarchical structure to its emphasis on honor and duty. This cultural exchange serves as a powerful lens through which to examine universal themes of identity, loyalty, and human nature.
1	"I was excited for the show to come out, though I had limited expectations. I've only played New Vegas and Fallout 4 (loved both).The show to me seems a bit...light hearted. One review called this the Disney version of Fallout and I think that's a perfect comparison. There wasn't much danger when traveling outside. And the people inside seemed like campy people from the 50s. Like a Leave it to Beaver cast.The show also bounced around far too much and I don't feel that that they handled that all too well. Often I had to ask myself ""did I miss something?""Two last points...there was ZERO explanation as to why Moldaver was still alive. She's a key character. Kinda feels like that should have been touched on. And at the beginning the raiders were radioactive but weren't scanned?"
1	Grey's was AWESOME in the beginning!!!! It has changed so much and has become so boring compared to the beginning. It needs to end already! Shonda Rhimes no longer writes for the show and you can tell! It should have ended maybe 10 seasons ago! But of course those of us who started it, want to see how it ends. Please end now!
2	"GOT should have been the greatest television series ever made. And until the end of season 6 it was. The show had everything: superb writing, outstanding production values, epic scale, gritty and complex characters, likable villains and unlikable heroes, blood and guts, plenty of suspense and let's not forget some pretty frank treatment of sex too. The show was very modern (e.g. Most of its surviving leading characters were women), without being preachy or shrill about it. One of the GOT's most appealing aspects has always been that it's hard to distinguish heroes from villains here, and the show tries hard tp prevent the viewers from classifying the characters in those terms. (Of course, there are exceptions, like Joffrey.) While over time the audience gets more and more emotionally invested in the characters of Daeneris and Jon, and to somewhat lesser extent Arya and Sansa, they are also portrayed as rather flawed, complex and contradictory figures, that chase and grow over time. For me the high point of the show was episode 10 of season 6, with the aftermath of Cersei's trial. If the show had ended then, I would have gave it 10/10. The 7-th season was still watchable and entertaining but the quality of writing clearly went down. While the pace of the action picked up, somehow it also felt more perfunctory and it became harder to care. Nothing like the episode ""The Door"" in this season. And the of course comes season 8. As many other reviewers noted, a complete and utter disaster. The writing completely collapsed, cartoonishly so, and the storyline became nonsensical and full of holes. A good final episode might have still saved the season and the series but instead we were handed a cruel and disgusting joke. For much of the duration of the series the show's creators prided themselves on unexpected plot twists and staying ahead of the audience, keeping it guessing. But that cannot be the point of the grand finale of the magnum epic like GOT. Here you have to deliver the expected. The most predictable and the most satisfying moment in the final episode was the ""Clegane bowl"". And I have not heard anyone complain about it. But you cannot build up the audience's emotional investment in the fate of the main character over the period of 8 years and then suddenly turn her form a queen-to-be into a raving mass murderer and kill her off. And on top of that discard the second most important character in the series as an unimportant afterthought. That's a complete betrayal of the loyalties of the audience of the series and it made it impossible to rewatch the show for most people. A great pity, really, since many of the early episodes are true masterpieces. But the vanity and the stupidity of the writers in the finale killed the entire series."
2	Fortunately, I knew nothing about the books and watched without prejudice. I enjoyed it immensely! The series is in my opnion at least an 8 and will probably eventually score even higher. To the book readers, who I think are rather disappointed, don't behave so spoiled. Enjoy the beautiful visuals and the fact that you get such stunning imagery for a few euros a month. Also, I have to laugh at the criticism that it's so unlikely for young people to have such prestigieus scientific jobs. As if what else happens in this series is so likely! Sci-fi is sci-fi, I would say. And 'young' people can achieve stunning resulta, why not?! By the way, at the age of these scientists, Mozart was almost deceased. So why couldn't it be possible? Anyway, I'm looking forward to the sequels and will definitely watch. A beautiful series and thank you for making it!
2	I started watching this show merely because people around me asked me to. By the end of Season 1 it really had me invested my time and curiosity. Later seasons got me completely hooked and made me a kind of free marketing agent for this show since I was telling my friends to watch this show.I believe the graph of the show starts at the lowest point and from ending season 1 gets a drastic rise. In my opinion it peaks at Season 4 and slowly declines from there. From Season 7 it drops completely and utterly.The last season had my huffing and puffing at every turning point, I would like to appreciate the cinematography of Season 8 which is by far the best in the whole show. The music I would say was best in season 6 and 7.It remains my favorite show till date, and yet the perfect example of 'Messing up something absolutely beautiful'.
2	I love greys anatomy, been there right from.the beginning, with all the trauma that Meredith has been through, the ups and downs. The amazing characters that you can feel are family. But since series 16 it has gone down hill. Finally, in series 18 episode 20, I feel like the good writing has returned. Finally you got rid of Owen and Teddy, Finally you are putting Meredith back in the centre of the attention. FINALLY!! Keep this up, get her someone closer without the crap of coming, going, leaving not leaving. See if you can have guest appearances from old cast. New blood is needed. And there is the fun missing and far too much emphasis on thr issues of the day rather than working nonetheless characters. Yes we need true life issues hut they shouldn't be the main theme. Finally!!
0	The audacity of some of you to say oh no political messages in the show. Such a funny show. Wonderful. Thank you. You're the reason we have nothing good. Please rave about this show that included a genocidal freak. The second ign said omg what a show so honest to the source material. I should've known. Please stop ruining people lives like come on. Swear. Some of us work day in day out, study day in day out. I just want to watch something good for once. Please stop it. This horrible. Like botttom of the barrel. I hate it when they try to write bad characters. Like why. Stop it. No plot. No story. Nothing. I'm done.
0	Trying ones best to be objective, the first 3 or 4 seasons of this show were quite brilliant, but since then it's decline has been difficult to watch. Now in the final season, there is really no need to watch the series to its conclusion, because the second half of the show can safely be ignored as poor writing reduces a groundbreaking show to Bold and the Beautiful levels of quality.The ending doesn't matter because the ethos of the show has been abandoned as the producers chase hype not excellence. Gone is the subtlety that marked GoT as something truly different, instead it is big, loud, cheesy, and predictable. Pure convention in other words. Characters lose their characteristics, and inconvenient plot threads shoved aside in favour of standard Hollywood B movie schlock.As a whole, despite the riveting first few seasons, the show eventually collapses on itself, and is a chore to watch from season 7 onwards.If you haven't seen it yet, avoid the disappointment.
0	Before season 8 I loved Game of Thrones but the writers truly screwed up. I feel Game of Thrones has been going downhill since season 6 when they had no source material ( A song of Ice and Fire) but it has truly fallen this last season with apparent lack of money clearly affecting the plot despite them being offered more money by HBO which is seen when Rhaegal is killed easily by Cerseis Scorpions while daenarys casually flys over the Iron fleet which I believe is for production reasons and then at King landing the Scorpions are clearly nerfed with it taking longer to reload and horrible accuracy. Also Ghosts farewell in episode 4 was lacking in emotion which the director David Nutter said was due to it being expensive and time consuming, sorry for your trouble. I could rant forever but before season 8 I would probably have rated it a 6 and before season 6 it would be 10 ultimately this is the writers doing and they certainly don't deserve a star wars trilogy Ryan Johnson has done enough to ruin Star Wars never mind these guys.

0	Adapting a video game is always tough, but this series does it very well. Every scene looks amazing and seemingly stays true to the spirit of the game.The first episode had me hooked. Lucy and Ghoul introduced (both great characters) and the action after the wedding was awesome. And then....Every scene in the vault was absolutely dreadful to get through once Lucy leaves it. Watching freakin Rico from Hannah Montana suspiciously and somberly walk around for 7 episodes was ridiculous. The humor from Lucy's cousin & other leaders of the vault was awful.Finn, I mean Maximus, was unbearably boring of a character. They really forced a love connection between him and Lucy and really just copied Finn's story from Star Wars.Scenes just went on way too long. Every flashback with Walton Coggins and his wife was just too long and rather boring. The reveal that Lucy's dad was actually bad was very bad. The acting from Lucy was great, but I really don't need 2 full mins of her sad face reacting to the news and her dad pleading in the cage that it wasn't true.The cameos just seemed mid as well. Why have Fred Armisen and not do anything funny in his scene. Matt Berry could have been utilized better too.Idk it just really annoyed me more than I enjoyed it. Giving it props for looking so good though and really enjoyed Lucy as a character & the actress. Walton Coggins of course always killing it.If this tells me one thing, BIOSHOCK SERIES NEEDS TO HAPPEN.
0	"The premise of the show is intriguing, but certain casting choices hard to swallow. As someone who works at a top university and occasionally crosses paths with remarkable scientists, many of whom are seasoned with significant experience (over the age of 40. . . At least), frankly, the characters seem too young to be 'remarkable scientists.' This takes away from the believability of the story and makes it a hard watch.I'm probably a stick in the mud on this, but for me characters have to align in age or approximate age with the character's professional background. That's like my pet peeve. I mean, a 20 year old super scientist doesn't work for a serious storyline, unless it's a comedy. And really, is there any, allow me to create a word, ""scientisting"" going on here? This is typical Hollywood over the past 30 years. Let's target the age of who we think will view this movie. Never mind the actual story and characters.There's more, the story lacks a connection to the characters. It's possible that this disconnect is from the overarching focus on a future event, coupled with it being a series. A television series provides ample opportunity for character development, but with this targeted under 21-30 audience and no feeling for the characters this also makes it a hard watch.I am intrigued by the premise and curious to see how it unfolds, but as it stands, I may not be on board to finish this season.Maybe I should read the book!"
2	Season 1-4 were practically perfect, there is not much to say. It had so many great moments, so many great episodes there. But then... well the writers kinda ran out of books to adapt. Season 5 and 6 were pretty boring most of the time. But they truly had their moments even having some of the best episodes of the show. Season 7 you could really see the dip in quality. Everything just felt so rushed most of it was really stupid. And then ofc. Season 8 the biggest disapointment I have ever seen. I have never seen anything more terrible. The ending was the stupidest thing i have ever seen. All of the characters were just so stupid. Everything felt even more rushed. And all the characters were basically ruined because of the writing. Overall i still give it a 9/10 just because of the first half of the show. And ofc it did still have its moments. I would still consider this show a masterpiece and I would 100% recomend. It is truly a must watch show.
2	After feeling that streaming had past it's halcyon days for a while now different platforms have blown me away over the last couple of weeks.Ripley was a superb retelling of a book I love and now this drops straight after.I've never seen or played the game, am aware of some of the imagery but not any characters or narrative. So for me, this has to stand alone and I have no idea if it is true to the source.However, who cares? I know it's popular to moan about things not respecting source material but if it's this good, can't we just enjoy it?The best bit for me is the overarching narrative of big business taking control of governments. Feel relevant?The main characters are well established and brilliantly played. With some of the side characters feeling a little underdone.The story was defined and well executed with just enough tension and confusing to keep me guessing.Decent dialogue, dark and sometimes childlike humour work together with superb production values and direction.It's funny, weird, engaging and in some places brilliantly gory.Is streaming getting its mojo back?
1	"This season is sooooooo sloooooooow! I fast forward through all of the ""coma dream"" sequences now as they are boooooring.,I also like to escape a little bit of COVID being everywhere and this season is really all the shoe is about. It use to be a great show but I am one episode away from writing the series off. I'm 15+ years invested so I keep thinking ""one more week..."""
1	If I hear them call each other boo one more time, I'm literally going to lose it.
0	How are you going to kill Satan, and expect us to care about who is president afterwards.
2	I thought this show was going to be around first year interns at a Seattle Hospital. I wasn't expecting Meredith Grey to be the central character. I love watching Sandra Oh and Patrick Dempsey. They are both excellent actors themselves. With the success of Sideways, Sandra can be singing all the way to the bank. She is very entertaining to watch even in this show. I would say this is an average show. I like the fact that Meredith is the daughter of a famous surgeon who now does not remember her own name possibly from Alzheimer's disease. I do not understand networks who keep trying to use the same familiar surroundings like a hospital or a police station in dramas. There are too many dramas on today. I would much rather have something original. Since it comes after Desperate Housewives, it is not a bad show. It just needs time to grow. There are good episodes sometimes but I think the characters are so involved in their personal love lives that they have forgotten medicine sometimes. I don't think this show is evolving appropriately to combine love, medicine, story lines, and a mixture of it equally. I love Kate Burton who appears as Ellis Grey, Meredith's mother. Anyway, it has become Ally McBeal meets ER now rather than St. Elsewhere.
1	I had read the books years before the series came out and was a bit dubious about how it would translate to the screen. I then saw HBO were doing it which eased my worries as they make some superb programmes, and when I finally got to watch it, it is superb from the first scene.Excellent casting, acting and staying close to the books this was the best programme on TV for years!The problem is the series overtook the books and since then it has gone downhill, especially the final series. There is a massive battle which should be incredible but I found it a real let down, and the episodes after this are even worse. These characters that have been so well developed over the years suddenly act in ways that are just bizarre, I'm incredibly disappointed, I doubt George R R Martin had much to do with the scripts/plot and I'm sure he can't be happy with the result. 10/10 for the first few seasons, 3/10 for the last one.There were also a couple of things in the previous season which were a big letdown, like explaining where the bad guys came from, and some characters were massively underused, or their story arc just seemed to tail off when the had been so promising.Overall definitely worth watching but prepare yourself for disappointment towards the end.
2	"The first 8 episode season of Fallout is great in so many ways. The series is super fun! It's sci-fi, fantasy style is perfect for this un-realistic, retro-futuristic nuclear fallout setting. The story and character building is done quick, but still feels deep and attaches meaning to the characters backstories before we meet them. The series quickly develops character that we are attached to without even knowing why.The bounty hunter, Cooper Howard, is introduced early in the first episode and ends up as these nuclear-radiated, immortal bounty hunter. While we don't quite know his motives, we are attracted to his unwinding storyline of hurting whoever gets in his way until we learn of his true motives.This series is unique and well done. It's a fun watch but also with meaning and potential behinds it characters Lucy, Maximus, and even Norm. Excited to see the direction of the future seasons and would love to see what other ""experiments"" have been taking place in fallout shelters!"
0	"Someone needs to not let the GoT guys work in the industry anymore. What even is this show? It's terrible the acting terrible, the visuals terrible, the story wtf.Some books should stay books.For real I went in blind ready for just some dope scifi and it's just stupid and makes no sense.Too many character story lines crammed into one where it just jumps to spots and you just accept ok here we are.I hate how Hollywood tries to hide behind ""smart"" concepts and we will just eat it up because we are just dumb watchers. When their ""smart"" is just a bunch of mobo jumbo.I don't see how it's getting all these 10/10. It's terrible."
1	"I'm an old school Fallout fan, meaning I appreciate more the Black Isle Studios era of the game. I watched the series, but it felt a bit like it was written by AI. Many member-berries to please gaming community, showcasing game mechanics which is out of place in the TV show (bullet time, stimpacks etc.) Scenario is very gamey, which is to be expected on one hand, but lackluster on the other as this is not the same media or experience.Characters (Maximus strikes me as ""Finn"" ) and writing are quite superficial, enough for a game, but could be better for a drama/series. Humor is supposed to be dark and witty ( think Monty Python Easter eggs, Harold, Sulik, terminal logs...) and to me it comes out short - to banal and too shallow.Too many irrelevant, boring and repeated scenes, too little character building/drama (exception being Cooper Howard ...) Scenario is also a bit awkward as it is placed too far into the future to be plausible (160 or so years after Fallout 1, and within same geographic region). Whatever happened to the water chip?"
2	I love the Fallout game series. I have been playing them for decades. I love the post-apocalyptic world. I love the back story and glimpses into the past. I've always said the Fallout world would make a great movie or TV show. But, if the past is any indication, it would not do the games justice. Except this series. I was blown away by the attention to detail. It's like they mirrored the game to the screen. I felt like I was playing another iteration of my favorite franchise. Story was a bit slow in the beginning, but quickly picked up the pace. Love the bits of humor thrown in just like the games. But also is equally dystopian in all it's glory. Would love more of Inon Zur's original music from the games, there is a taste of it here and there, but I would love to hear more. With all the positive feedback, I am confident this will get picked up for more seasons. Keep em coming, I love it.
1	Let me start by saying I have not read any material or watched anything on this but know it's regarded as the best science fiction ever written. So with that being said I have no skin in the game but expected in a way greatness to be shown to me. I'm left underwhelmed and kind of disappointed. To the average consumer that is like me thats has no clue about anything on this subject, I wanted to get introduced into something amazing and understand the genius of it but I'm left uninspired. There wasn't nearly enough science explained or shown and although the first 2 episodes hook you in with a murder mystery and even a mystery of who is trying to solve the murders, the breakdown of all science which still didn't clarify or dive into, the countdown, the video game and overall tone felt exciting and I wanted to see more of that but it quickly disappears or is resolved. These group of friends that are supposed to be some of earth's brightest seem to have a boring teenage drama about them or just uniteresting character development or story besides maybe 2 of them. It's greatest parts were the Chinese flashback story and the early mystery of everything then it quickly becomes a humanity vs aliens with not enough to keep it alfoat of curiosity. It's called 3 body problem (in which they figure out and don't dive into and move on from completely) but it really is more of * Oxford 5* problem.
0	I was really looking forward to this show. The commercials made it look like a respectable portrayal of cultures and relationships. However, I couldn't bare to watch any more raw cruelty and let's be honest, I wasn't ready to read thru the entire show of subtitles like it's some obscure foreign film on Netflix. I tend to prefer shows that are more for a general audience, nothing extreme. But this show is exactly that. Extreme and hard to watch. Not a good choice if you just want to chill at home after work and follow a good story. Between having to read thru the entire episode and watching families be murdered and some dude get boiled alive, ummm no thanks. Back to Sportscenter it is...
1	I'm thru episode 1 and part way thru 2. I felt the need to jump on this and comment.Everything is very much on point. Except one excruciatingly annoying aspect. The character Auggie Salazar, she needs to take a happy pill and quit being such a B. Every time, and I mean every time another character engages with her she gives them the cold shoulder. Even if she invites someone to come see her. She'll act like they are a nuisance and wishes they weren't there bothering her. It's old and played out at this point. I really hope the director changes that as I proceed.I don't know if it's bad acting or the inability to act and have any depth so she does the only thing she knows how to do - act like B. Like those kids in school that hated when a teacher called on them or tried joking around to lighten up the mood. The kid is shy, but instead acts out because that's all he knows. Well I'm not seeing any acting ability in her part at all. It's like B-level horror movie acting with the damsel as the lead. No substance. Just pretty screams and stupid attempts at having emotionsI'd consider two more stars if that were minimized at this point but B-force is strong with this one.
0	Why is this still going on? I mean it was okay for the first two or three seasons, but come on. All they started doing was to go in circles. Why do people keep watching this telenovella?
2	i really love Grey's Anatomy! it is the best TV show ever. five interns who start together and become residents. a great idea so that we can watch their development! i admire Meredith Grey played fantastically by gorgeous Ellen Pompeo. such an interesting character who lived many ups and downs and still does not give up! and then there is Dr. Mc Dreamy who is played by handsome Patrick Dempsey!i think every woman wants to ave her own Mc Dreamy when she sees how he looks at Meredith!but i also have to admit that the show changed! there are new characters like Marc, Dr Hahn and Lexie. i really like them but i am sad that Kate Walsh has gone because Addie was very important in her role as Satan^^ but whats worse is the change of characters and Shonda Rhimes ideas of relationships like Gizzie or dose^^nobody needs this nd the relationship of Mer and Derek became ridiculous. who wants to see all the ups and downs with no conclusion? but all in all it is a great TV show and i love it, especially the voice overs of Meredith!
1	... the first 4 episodes really had me but after that I was ready for the season to be done. Why do you have to make a season unnecessarily longer than it needs to be? I really was exhausted when I watched the last 4 episodes. They could've cut off at least 2 characters by then! Mostly because the book is (of course) so different with the characters. Season 2 already sounds exhausting to me, unfortunately. Still I think this is a great science fiction show and I hope that more shows like this will he made! Just with the more important things in mind and cutting off all the unnecessary parts. For me it is still a must see, but take your time and be patient.
0	It seems the days of good fantasy are now dead forever. Gone are the worlds of magic and mysticism to be replaced by graphic sex and even more graphic violence. Tolkien and Lewis are doing somersaults in their respective graves. Now we have lots of violent battle scenes interrupted by dull, soap-opera-like pedantry. And while it may be technically impressive in it's many cartoon-like computer graphics, the actual writing and acting are embarrassingly bad. One can only feel pity for otherwise good actors like Charles Dance and the great Diana Rigg. As to the stories, they are exceedingly dull and totally unimaginative...By the way, I have trudged through 4 seemingly interminable seasons hoping it might get better, only to be seriously disappointed...and the seasons are only 10 episodes!!!
1	I'm into the second season of this show. It's pretty enjoyable. Here's the good news. I like the casual mix of race, I like that a lot. It doesn't seem forced. I love Chandra Wilson as 'the Nazi' who is in charge of our ingénue doctors (or interns as they are apparently known as in the trade). I love that she is not tall and willowy, love that she is who she is. Chandra Wilson is the star of this show, a wonderful actress. Go Chandra. Also find myself getting to like the pretty blonde Izzy, who despite the drawback of being yet another pretty blonde, is managing to rise above that. The writers have given her more dimension and she is shining in a quiet way. Also the jock intern, Alex is showing up in the 2nd season as having more going on and that is a pleasure to watch. What is really getting on my nerves is the shows namesake, Meredith Grey. Here we have the Sarah Jessica Parker narrator. She is the weakest link. played by Ellen Pompeo she is all big eyes and sulky pout. Her persona has worn completely thin for me. She is all sulk. That is her personality. Stand there, widen the eyes, pout. Writers, give her some bite. Well, some personality. Any personality. Why does she have to moon after the attending surgeon, played by Patrick Dmpey? If she is into one night stands give her some. Her character seems so foggy, maybe that is the point, she is foggy. Maybe we are supposed to find her and her stuff completely boring? Perhaps that is one of the points of the show. Di d I mention the show is set in a hospital? The OR room I think, I'm not a doctor, not a nurse so, I do not know for sure. It doesn't really matter. It is just a vehicle to watch these characters shuffle around each other in Seattle or Portland somewhere like that, though it is probably shot on Burbank of Canada. They could be graphic designers or gardeners. It so happens the genre is hospital, they play doctor, but that is it. It's just playing. I still watch this show, it is distracting. There's some fun performances, Sandra Oh not bad playing a bit of a cliché, know it all, no heart type intern doctor, gets a bit old but hey she gets to be the mean one which is fun, fun to be the bad gal. Isiah Washington, better in the 2nd series. Eh, you know, show set in hospital, cast play doctors, central character really boring, surrounding cast better. Way yo spend 40 minutes after a hard day at the office, maybe
0	This has been one of the most depressing turn of events of late. What was easily a 9+ rated serial and seen such a major fall that it's almost unbelievable something like this (season 8) could actually be written by those who are supposed to write the grand finale of something really as grand as GoT.It's as if someone was hell bent on burning the legacy of GoT to the ground (much like the burning of King's Landing) - all carefully crafted character arcs thrown down the drain, strange and totally uncalled-for character turns, sloppy writing, and sloppy production as well (Is it some coincidence that only in Season 8 we see a coffee cup on the table?).This series deserved so much better. Perhaps the writers and directors should learn something from the makers of Breaking Bad, True Detective, The Wire etc. The ending of any series is a golden opportunity for the writers and directors to send themselves to glory - but here the team has probably made sure that no one ever employs them again.
2	"Usually I am one who gets mad at characters making poor choices in a story, but here their choices, though seem poor, are all logically and emotionally consistent. I believe their arcs; not even, I am fully on board. If they were to be in these situations and had made ""better"" choices, that would have been strange. Because what society deems to be ""better"" is not what they truly desire.I got through the first season in one sitting as it fully grabbed my attention. I'd look forward to more but it is hard to imagine the same story continuing on for much longer without an agonizing end, for both the viewers and the characters.Brilliant performance from Richard Gadd."
0	The lack of colour made everything feel drab and lifeless. I mean, how am I supposed to get invested in a show when it looks like it was filmed in the 1950s? It's 2024, for crying out loud! We have the technology to make things vibrant and exciting, yet they chose to subject us to this greyscale nightmare.I tried to give it a chance, I really did. But I couldn't make it more than 10 minutes into the first episode before I had to tap out. It was just too painful to watch.The decision to film in black and white completely ruined any potential the show might have had.Save yourself the agony and skip this one. Unless you're a glutton for punishment or have a strange affinity for outdated cinematography, you'll thank me later for steering clear of this monochrome mess.
0	Are you ready for a couple of hot actresses and dorky actors trying to solve their love lives ? I half expected the Friends theme song to play whenever the «Oxford 5» mer up and for them them to start talking about Instagram likes . Pretty much no Chinese actors , the plots been dumbed down and all the female actors are are actors/models . On a more serious note the show struggles with what it wants to be . A show for teenage social media or for fans of the book. The two dont mix and it shows. The only good things about this show are the Chinese revolution and aftermath parts . Those are also the parts most resembling the books.
1	I realized that I prefer this type of TV shows, it was a perfect show to watch, I loved the characters, the kind comedy, Hell I even loved the law more than ever before... please renewed for season 3 after season 2 please ❤👏🙏
1	This series starts off great with loads of promise. When I seen it was made by the same people who made Game of Thrones I thought, I'm in for a ride.By the last few episodes it just seems dragged out, boring and cringey. They could have fit it into 5 episodes really as I felt myself losing interest during the last 3 episodes.In the end it just turns into your typical, boring, 'safe the world' series where everything is hinging on a small team of 'heroes'.I would rate the first 5 episodes as 8/10 and the last 3 episodes as 3/10. I wouldn't bother watching it if I knew how it was going to turn out. Save your time.
0	Despite the good actors and attractive beginning, unfortunately, the scenario and the story are extremely far-fetched and illogical. I only saw the beginning of the first episode and I have a big question mark as to how they opened the gate without going through a simple security protocol to make sure there are no killers and looters on the other side. I don't even open the door to my house without making sure who is behind the door, how come they didn't care and just pushed a button to open the gate? I'm giving it two stars just because it's called Fallout. If you are going to make a series based on one of the most popular video games, please take it seriously.
1	I started it from the 3rd season, i actually like it, all the characters are likeable, especially Nathan and Melissa. After seeing so many bad reviews on the 3rd, I guess the 1st and 2nd should be quite good, cant wait to see it.
1	Thank you for your request to make the review of a TV show more readable. Here is a revised version that may meet your needs: Man, I really wanted to enjoy this show. But man is it hard.. One aspect of television shows that I value immensely is when characters are believable and their actions have consequences that impact the plot. In Fallout, however, the characters seem to be playing roles rather than genuine people.The turret scene had me actually in tears. It captured the essence of what plagues the show as a whole. Instead of writing a more believable escape, let's have a minigun miss 120 rounds from only 10 meters away because it looks really cool.
0	It's April 30, 2021...Meredith has been in heaven for so long it's become completely boring. No light at the end of the tunnel at Grey/Sloan...no mention of vaccines, or the kids going to school, or asking if life will ever be normal again, no they're all just happy with the way it is, not wanting it to end.It's over for me.
1	First 5 seasons are simply masterpieces another 2 are not as good but still better than most other shows. However last season is a disappointment which will make you feel like the whole show was waste of your time.10/10 for season 1-7, 0/10 for season 8. One could argue that season 8 does not deserve 0/10 because it had great actors, cinematography, etc. But you know what? Yes, a single thing can ruin everything else. And it did.
2	Its mostly a really good show. It adapted the source insanely well, both in aestethic and feel. Anyone who's played the games will probably love this by default as its not just easter egg based references but actually manages to recreate the atmosphere nearly perfectly.Visually its a 10/10 adaptation, the music is mostly from the games which is the best decision they could have made and most of the actors are great in their roles.So why not a 10 ?Take away the nostalgia and the already existing world to build on and the plot itself is mid at best. Its on par with some of the ingame lore you'll get from playing the games. The action pieces are somewhat lacking at times imo. And while the acting is good, some of the characters are just ... bland and uninteresting and spend an awful lot of time just staring at stuff in confusion.Given the stakes set up and the asumed danger around every corner of the wasteland, the amont of time spend just standing around in confusion just does not fit and took me out of it many times througout the show. Especially Maximus but other characters as well.Its fine to get calm moments, but the show got plenty as is and it just doesn't seem right that every character seems to need a moment of deep thought (which is not interesting to look at from a cinematic perspective either if you do it 3 times each episode) in order to decide basicly anything.I get what they tried doing but it just doesn't work imo.
2	I don't know enough about Japanese history to be able to comment on its accuracy, so this review is just about the entertainment aspect.Two episodes in and I'm hooked. I love the writing, casting, directing, cinematography, the plot(s), the balance of CGI/sets, soundtrack and pace. It's even made me want to go and learn about 17th Century Japan in detail.I have few criticisms of it, but if I were to pick a main one, then it would be the speed that some of the key players are introduced. Being the ignorant Westerner that I am, it's a bit of a struggle early doors to keep up with all the names and places.If you don't mind something that's, at times, a bit brutal and if you're better able than me to keep up with the names, then I think this is well worth a watch and highly recommended it.
1	Come on. You're hunting for someone but no one asks for a picture of Richard Greenleaf? I mean the inspector was a sharp guy but his failure to ask for a picture, and the failure or Marge to volunteer one is unexplainable to me. I understand the story would have been over quickly if a picture had been provided to use in questioning every one who came in contact with Ripley. It was too big of an omission for me to completely buy into the story. Then the disguise when speaking to the inspector. Again, this took away from the entire story. Heck, he even spoke the same way with the same voice. The black and white was striking at first but I think took away from the beauty of the setting after a while. Andrew Scott did a great job. I felt he was an intelligent psychopath. I had no issues with his choice as Ripley. The show was a slow burn, maybe too long. I could have been done in 6 episodes. But p, in the end, I just wish I could forgive the lack of anyone asking for a picture.
0	"Take every fantasy cliché' you've ever seen or read, repeat those in a dull soap opera format that plods from subplot to subplot, and you have ""Game of Thrones."" Why are way too many of the character in shows today written as female characters regardless of the actual sex of the character? giving lots of dialogue a ""prissy,"" ""catty"" tone that rings hollow like a soap opera? Where are the male characters speaking and acting like men do? I simply can't imagine feudal warlords having prissy repartee like modern HS students, yet ""Game of Thrones"" is full of it. Fantasy themes are supposed to be at least as much action as character or dialogue driven. This show is 95% talk and 5% action. GOT is dirt cheap to make and formulaic.Season One wasn't all that bad, but the second season of this show is one of the worst examples of ""hook the audience, then bleed them out slowly and rip them off"" I've ever seen, straight off a midway. It may be the worst season of a television program I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot.Avoid this if you are over 14 or under 14 and reasonably intelligent."
2	Season 1-6 are some of the best season of TV I've watched, would give it a 10. Season 7 went way downhill as they tried to make too much happen too fast, would give it an 7.5. Season 8 sucks, would give it a 5. If I hadn't invested years in the show I'd stop watching
0	"This continued story of arrogant training officers is getting really boring. Most especially the character of Tim Bradford. Wholly cripey, is this the rudest guy ever?I mean seriously, everyone of the so-called ""training officers"" know everything. They never make mistakes? Extremely boring. Change the theme, change anything, change everything. Last of my watching this attempt.Don't get me wrong, the actors are great....the writers, not so much."
2	Let me tell u! What a awesome episode, i don't know what's next , but it's solid, smart and action bomb in last minutes.. hope keep going same taste and i recomended al 100% watch it if u like spy and war story with a other kind of point. Robert D. Jr. And Hoa Xuande do great roles and emotions in all the track.Another good reason is the scenography and visuals themes in the history... Maybe the ex marines have a better idea of this, but for me is sober and educative about this war.We know is bases from the book , i don't read it anyway!!!!!! Waiting for the next week to see what happen later!
2	This is a cop show, in the tradition of Southland, Dragnet and Third Watch, but with Nathan Fillion charm thrown in. One of my favorite new shows!!
0	"So Netflix who pissed on Neil Gaiman's The Sandman team up with the 2 guys who popped on The Game of thrones giving to one of the most world wide loved TV series the worst last 2 seasons and finale ever.Cixin Liu's books are just fantastic. Now I don't want to be that person who start winging something like ""the book was better boohoo"" but if you have the best source material...why vomiting this stuff?.Question is why western people'l cannot even imagine to watch a show staged in Asia and acted by Asians? But it's ok. We need to recast swap genders so no one complains and we have to stage it in London because everyone who is a native English speaker has a relative there...the problem here is that this is so bad. The cringe in the dialogues, the teenage dramas.Tye casting is mostly awfully done. Queen of the worst.Eiza Gonzales: the less credible scientist ever. Annoying in every appearance.John Bradley: shut up please Jovan Adepo: whatever Alex Sharp: why is he even here?Loved Benedict wong at least someone who could really be Da Shi.The part staged in China was good. But everything happening so fast. The books were a slow burning. We found out about the aliens towards the end of the book here the big reveal happens in episode 3!! The heck?At episode 4 now and I am about to drop it..."
0	Great series up to 5th season where it was going along with the books. Worst ending ever. We had so many expectations, the story was so rich with so many opportunities to evolve but clearly the writers were not skilled. They managed to destroy the whole story. If I knew that it was going to be such a disappointment I wouldn't start watching it in the first place.
1	So today i was thinking about game of throneshonestly such a sad thing to have happened to a television showSeason 1 was rough on the edges, it looked alright but it's pretty noticeable that they didn't have the highest budget and the pilot had some issues. But the story was there, it was great. Sure its slow, but the payoffs are so heavyCome to season 2, and this show has turned into what I would consider a masterpiece. Everything from season 2 to season 4 is solidly one of the best television experiences I have seen. Genuinely I cannot begin to tell you how many payoffs there would be for every single action throughout these seasons, the intrigue and politics are phenomenal. The sets, the battles, the betrayals, certain episodes are still locked in my mind. There is not a single episode in these seasons or moment that I felt would not fit perfectly in the world and there isnt a single episode i would give lower than a Low 7/10. These 3 seasons are honestly the pinnacle of television, this is what people think of when they think of the best parts of game of thrones.Season 5 and season 6 feel like a drop in quality for me, but its not drastic, its just not as memorable. I still love these seasons and there are still epic scenes and good moments for the characters, its just lacking the source material. Some characters really lack a lot of the original personality and others become very 1 dimensional. There is cool things that happen and its still good at this point, but sometimes i wonder if they could stand as highly without the buildup of the first 4 seasons. There are a few episodes in these seasons that are just straight up kinda dull too.But everyone knows about 7 and 8. Every character that has been built up for seasons now just throws everything away. Its like the writers of the show forgot what they had written for 7 years. Seriously, everyone just flips like a coin. You could possibly have everyone change their characters personalities in the way that the show tries to do, but it has to be over a longer period of time. This is insanely rushed and doesn't feel anything like the original show i came to love. Everyone does stupid garbage, characters are killed offscreen, yeah the sets look cool but that doesn't mean anything if you're putting cinematography and sets on your poop cake story you decided to diarrhea out. Such a horrible ending to show that deserved so much more. Its not like this ending is the worst thing I've ever seen, but its more the principle that the first few seasons had extreme help from the source material... Like dang D&D, i cant believe you guys cannot write being ya know, show writers.S1 - Low 8/10S2 - High 9/10s3 - Low 10/10s4 - Low 9/10s5 - Mid 6/10s6 - Mid 6/10s7 - High 4/10s8 - Low 4/10.Overall the first 6 seasons are much worth the watch, but.... Season 7 is bad, season 8 is much worse, and honestly its really detrimental on a show this long to have such a unfulfilling ending. I cant even recommend this show cuz of the ending. Please remake the last season at least dudes. Its like you edged me for 7 years hbo and then told me to go to bed what the heck.I know that if you add all the numbers and then divide that this doesn't round out to a 6, but with such an unfulfilling ending I cant give this a 7, its not worth a 7 at the end of it all. It all leads to nothing. You wasted my time and I didnt want to just go to bed hbo.Mid 6/10.
2	My Review- Ripley Streaming on NetflixMy Rating 8/10It's unusual for me to begin a review by praising the cinematographer but this 8 part series is a joy to watch from beginning to end it immediately reminded me of the work of the famous French photographer and film maker Henri Cartier-Bresson.The Director and writer of this adaptation Steven Zaillian was inspired by a black and white photo on the cover of his edition of The Ripley novel by Patricia Highsmith .It stayed on his mind and he thought his television adaptation would lend itself to the monochrome treatment and I think it was a great decision .The cinematographer Robert Elswit shot all episodes with Arri Alexa LF digital cameras capturing amazing definition and depth .Andrew Scott plays a more mature Tom Ripley than the previous actors that have played this character both Alain Delon and Matt Damon were in their mid twenties Andrew Scott was in his late forties when he filmed Ripley.I think he gives a fascinating new take on the character far more darker and complex than the previous fine actors who interpreted the role Alain Delon in the French movie Plein soleil or Matt Damon in the 1999 movie The Talented Mr Ripley.I wont say that Andrew Scott gives the definitive interpretation but it's certainly the most interesting his face is a canvas that constantly changes as he deceives, charms, murders when his evil deeds catch up with him . His portrayal of Tom Ripley is of a man with a thousand faces who feels a self entitlement and desire to possess the affluence and wealth of his victim Dickie Greenleaf played by Johnny Flynn.Tom Ripley flees his fraudulent lifestyle in Manhattan when his schemes unravel landing in The Italian Riviera like a cuckoo in to the nest of Dickie Greenleaf the privileged son of a wealth Baron who commissions Tom to convince his artistic playboy son to return to the family fold back in America .Tom Ripley not only has to convince Dickie Greenleaf that he knew him in America he also has to convince his suspicious girlfriend Marge Sherwood played by Dakota Fanning sister of Elle who really impressed me in this role what a talented family she belongs to.Tom Ripley is a loner and even rehearses his deceptive dialogue to with himself as he plots his strategy to convince the various characters in Dickie Greenleaf's life especially his girlfriend Marge Sherwood that he is who he says he is as he gradually wins over the trust of Dickie Greenleaf.I was less impressed with Johnny Flynn's casting as Dickie Greenleaf I thought he was dull and uninteresting but perhaps that's just what the director wanted ?The series for me started off at a little slower pace then after a few instalments it really took off at a very thrilling speed that reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock's style .In fact the whole series I thought is a tribute to the famous film-noir movies of the post war 1950's period.I looked up the definition of film noir which fits this series beautifully as a style of filmmaking characterized by such elements as cynical heroes, stark lighting effects, frequent use of flashbacks, intricate plots, and an underlying existentialist philosophy.Ripley is a well crafted series and very entertaining well worth a look in my opinion.
0	"I want to like this program. I try to like it, but as a former Southern California police officer, I find too many storyline errors. It would not take much editing to make this a good ""cop show."" I am sure there is suppose to be light moments. Nobody wants to watch a depressing program that shows some of the reality of being a police officer, but with just a few changes to procedure, the program will not have to be incredibility and tactically incorrect. Sometimes even laughably ridiculous. Eg, officers come across a suspicious car with the engine running in an ally behind a closed business. A gunfight between two officers and 3 suspects insures. A two officer car arrives as cover. One of the robbers is shot. Then one officer risks his life and the life of his partner by retrieving the wounded suspect (felon) and is more concerned about giving the suspect first aid than backing up his partner. Then he leaves the gun battle to rush one of the suspects to the hospital, while is partner is shooting it out with the remaining suspects. Absurd, ridiculous and totally unrealistic. if the individual that was shot was a fellow police officer, maybe that might happen, risking your life and the lives of the other officers to render first aid to the suspect. Each episode is full of both small and major errors. Get a police officer and maybe a trauma physician as consultants. You can keep the storyline, just work on believability and realism. Maybe you could have a Hill Street Blues."
1	My girlfriend insisted, and continued to insist that I watch Grey's. Eventually, I gave in, and loved it. The first two seasons are gold. That's where it ends however, as the third season was simply more of the same. That should be good, right? It isn't. Some of the characters who previously annoyed me a little (notably the protagonist Merideth) have all of a sudden become so unable to establish (and maintain) a proper relationship that their stupidity makes me want to do something bad. ...Yes friends, more of the same, more of the same will-they-wont-they rubbish, which is now rolled out to encompass George and Izzy. (George by the way going from my favourite character to my least favourite within season 3). It's not as bad as all that, but I expect more development, which has not happened. I think at the base of it all is that I am now bored and annoyed with the entire cast of characters (save the Nazi, who has remained a rock throughout). Hope this helps in some way
2	Having only seen 1 pilot episode I obviously can't fully revue this show but I can see that there has been a lot of effort put into making a good adaptation of a very interesting book.I watched the chinese tv show which is slow, dark and cumbersome but intriguing nonetheless.While this adaptation is close in narrative to the books there are obvious changes made to present this to a western audience while trying to retain the heart of the story.The pace of this show is good, its not however an action fast paced sci fi extravaganza. This is a thoughtful show where the mystery and intrigue looks like it will unravel over many episodes as we follow the characters and their Discovery's.The Chinese adaptation seemed to take a few altered political narratives and doubled down on its maths and science route often lacking an emotional connection to the viewer. Whereas in the book the emotional outlook of humanity tugs at its core.Visually everything is on point and the performances where solid, even though little was revealed it flows nicely although i can see many people wanting answers it would be a disservice to the books to do so.I am looking forward to watching the entire series and how they deal with hard to adapt science and quantum physics ideologies and tie into its core human nature plot.For some this show may be a bit niche or overwhelming for others it will be not as in depth or complex as may be hoping for.8/10 for its opening.
1	I never played the games, so I'm watching this as objectively as I can and keeping an open mind. After watching most of the episodes, I have some mixed thoughts. There are some excellent moments that build tension and drama very well. Then there are moments that seem completely out of place. These great moments convey a graveness and severity that is almost always broken by some ill thought out joke or plot point. If you do it once unexpectedly or set it up well, it can be funny. Doing it poorly over and over just makes it seem odd and breaks the viewer's engagement.The show will put in the time to build up a critical situation, they'll show a very violent gore filled scene and then cap it off in a shallow attempt at comedy. If it was written better, it would probably have worked, but it comes off as haphazard and awkward too often. It's almost as if the writers or showrunners don't want the show to be taken too seriously or become too frightening for the audience, which is strange for a post apocalyptic drama. It also lacks consistent quality writing, flow and consistently engaging plot points that would allow it to take comedic liberties.There are some great elements. Some characters (Ghoul, Wilzig and the elder) and plot arcs are interesting. They will show a great scene then lose the momentum they just built by shifting to others that are poorly done. It is so strange to have these amazing visuals only to then be awkwardly interrupted by unnecessary moments or a weird soundtrack that is out of place. The raid in the first episode leaves so many unanswered questions and just seems so implausible and forced. The character take so many actions that don't make any sense. The 10/10 reviewers don't have any issues with the plot or show at all???The characters don't seem to question these strange inconsistencies either. Even when they do, the other characters have no answers and so they just move on as if it never happened! This is another symptom of lazy writing. I understand that they are trying to keep some mystery while building the plot, but ultimately there is too much that is glossed over or is missing entirely. There are good moments and the writing can be good but there are always a few moments every episode that leave me shaking my head. It's a shame that there is so much going for this show but the writers just keep falling short.
0	Yes, the guys who made a real mess of the last seasons of Game of Thrones have, rather puzzlingly, been given another chance to make a mess of yet another great story.The series is actually quite interesting at first, it does have a number of problems but at least it's mildly entertaining. Unfortunately it becomes increasingly uninteresting after episode 4 and the weak writing spends far too much time making potentially interesting characters rather dull.What doesn't help is the casting - the only good to great actors are Liam Cunningham and Jonathan Pryce but even they can't do much with such such an ineptly written script and bad dialog. The rest of the main actors are a dull and uninspiring bunch who didn't hold my attention in any way whatsoever.So as far I'm I'm concerned that's another failed project for Weiss and Benioff.
0	Too much happening and too many errors. Just watched episode 11 and it's my last. our three teams of training and rookie officers dealt with : a homeless sweep, where an officer is stuck with a needle during an attack, clearing illegal banners from windows, a case of wrongful imprisonment / elder abuse, broke up an illegal alien flop house--even making up laws for the slum lord, dealt with a vice presidential assassin, an exploding trunk full of land mines during a gun buy back, accidental shooting during a traffic accident and foiled a mercy killing. The shows climax came with two of the three teams involved in a gun fight thwarting a pot store robbery. Many tactical errors in this scene. Police officers under fire would not leave a covered position to save a wounded robber while being shot a by the other robbers. One of the teams left to rush the wounded robber to the hospital while still under fire---abandoning their fellow officers in a fire fight. The hospital bound team drove up on the sidewalk within one block of the motorcade to get to the hospital.---Had this happened the secret service would have destroyed the vehicle with a rocket. An officer shot in the left shoulder during robbery was saved by his vest Later in the hospital his right shoulder is bloody. ....The show had the fbi coordinating security----wrong the Secret Service does that. ....They even had time to make pro weed legalization claim, anti-gun statements, illustrate the plight of the elderly homeless and illegal aliens. ----They managed to accomplish this in 40 minutes. Most any one of these events would tie up a team for an entire shift.
2	I binged this the first time I watched it. This is the kind of show that I didn't think Hollywood could make anymore. Packed with meaning at every turn with its pulse on the brokenness of so many. But truly not depressing or without a positive message. The ending was so pitch perfect bringing the entire saga full circle that I could do nothing but cry.As has been stated this is presumably a story about a bartender / comedian who ends up with a stalker who changes his life and helps him deal with truths in his life he couldn't face.My only quibble is that it sort of falls into some stereotypes of things that deeply trouble people but these tropes have been used a million times and I wish they would be more original on the many and varied ways people can become broken and the ways they deal with it.
0	I won't repeat what others have said, but the criticisms are oh so true. The main character is absolutely despicable, Lacking common sense, etiquette, and morals. When you're taken prisoner, for example, is it better to be a loudmouth rabble rouser, or just quietly assess the situation and figure out what's going on. He chose to be the loudmouth. People getting beheaded left and right for minor offenses, but they let this Englishman live? Ridiculous writing. The writers have him say the F word constantly, which makes teenagers watching this giggle, But it ruins it for a more discerning audience. The Portuguese Catholics and the Japanese lords have a successful trade agreement going on, and this one anti-catholic vulgar charlatan is going to change their minds overnight? The hip young women writers on this show made me give up after three episodes and go rewatch the Richard Chamberlain superior version.
1	I've been a fan of Nathan Fillion since back in the Firefly days. The guy has a knack for these comedy/dramas (just look at Castle), however this overall show seemed just a little too drama for my tastes. I recognize that if it was more procedural it would be a reality show, however officers constantly turning their back on suspects to discuss personal relationships is just beyond dumb. With the current political climate, this show was fortunate to already have 3 seasons under its belt, since it's almost guaranteed to not have a 4th. Now that he's been a writer/detective, a cop, and a spaceship captain/smuggler, I'll be very curious to see what Fillion pops up as next...
0	"Imagine having access to millions of dollars, the villas and oceans of Naples, and your pick of gorgeous, complicated men to play Tom Ripley and Dickie Greenleaf. Now, imagine saying to yourself, ""Nah!""Instead of making interesting choices that complement the wealth of source material from the book, you decide to squander it all with a lack of common sense, taste, and cultural appreciation. You shoot in black and white! You cast actors in their 40s with the emotional range of rocks to play youthful sex Gods! You cast an oddly young man to play Freddie Miles to make your leads look even older and less interesting!Every single choice - from Herbert Greenleaf's bizarrely working-class wardrobe to the badly dubbed opera singer's lipped-synced performance to the lack of color when shooting Picassos and Caravaggios or ocean views to the nearly as dull as Gwyneth Paltrow - is more dull and boring than the next."
2	The start is a little rough. I almost gave up but once I got past the first two episodes, I really started to enjoy it. I actually found it really great the way they were able to introducecharacters that are involved in all three of the books. I particularly enjoyed Will, I thought some of the changes that they made were actually pretty smart. At first when I saw the VR headset I thought it was stupid but after considering it it made a lot of sense. I really enjoy all of the cast, particularly Jin Chang. Contrary, I really did not like the actress that played Salazar. I just could never really believe that she was a brilliant scientist, she always just look like a cover girl actress done with a shoot, and she came off quite whiny and uninspired.
2	Nathan is perfect for this role and all the other actors beside the interesting story are a great match - I couldn't stop watching and can't wait to see more 💕💜👌🏻
0	Relatively possible to watch storyline, terrible acting and everything else to do with the show. The plot points are so cliche and done 929949292 times before. Unrealistic, a sink hole would not look like it did.
2	Robert Downey Jr on an HBO show that Team Downey produced is looking promising after episode one . Looking forward to seeing how this series plays out ,definitely has an interesting story. People saying in their reviews that Downey should let another actor play the role is ridiculous , having one of the best actors of our time playing this role can only improve this show also bring in more viewers considering the other cast members are unknown but after seeing the pilot the cast is great! The last show that Team Downey produced about Perry Mason was amazing so I would expect this to be just as good if not better ,guess we'll see.
2	Started off funny and ended so dark. Really unexpected storyline. Very well cast, everyone in the show are excellent. I would recommend this series to everyone's. Superb writing. Script is witty, intelligent and engaging. Episode 5 was especially dark but very well produced. Some really good acting, the chemistry between the stalker and the man is incredible, and the duo was amazing. The part when the son confessed about what happened to him and the dad's response was just simply guy wrenching.The series does drag on a tad bit with the stalking but I'm only being picky at this point. The ending can lead to a season 2?
0	The scripts on this show get more campy and ridiculous with each new episode. The FBI is way better than this.
0	This was a great show, then it turned into a man bashing nightmare. Even my wife said enough after the third season.This went the way of the Chicago shows and none of them are watchable anymore. When I sit down to watch a show, I don't want to watch how someone thinks the world should be, I want to watch a show that promotes both men and women as we are. Maybe to some this is entertainment, but as a guy, I'd rather watch paint dry. This is why more and more men are tuning out and just focusing on sports or reruns of shows that were actually good.I'm waiting for the day when the world isn't so insane and maybe TV will be good again. Cheers to hoping.
0	Unfortunately was ruined by lame script writing in seasons 7 and 8.
2	The series is very well shot in monochrome and in picturesque locations in Italy. The shades presented in black and white shots give a very unique and mysterious feeling.All the characters were apt with the main character ripley playing it perfectly. Female character Marge and inspector Ravinni were superbly played.The plot played it at good pace and the cunning and composed character demonstrated by Tom Ripley has come out well.Appreciate the depiction of the episodes through the paintings.Only if the police officer visiting Marge house at atrani would have picked snaps lying on the table. That would have nailed the plot.Must watch for those who like the slow pace plot.
2	I ended up binge watching the whole series within 24 hours. I would say after the first episode, I wasn't convinced that I would watch the whole series. But actually it grew on me.I'm a big fan of the Fallout game franchise, although I haven't played it in a while. I would recognise that it's not easy converting a video game story into a tv series or a movie without disappointing fans: a bit like the Assassins Creed Movie.This one actually worked. The action in the series, the way injuries and kills happen in the series, wouldn't work in a typical film or movie as it's unrealistic, only works in video games. But they kept the video game effect in the series. So it gets away with it. But that's probably because I'm a Fallout fan. I won't recommend it to any non-fallout fans as they simply won't get it.I don't usually watch tv series', as I can't get into them anymore: they require time and focus. Most series' don't catch my full attention. But this one did.I hope we won't have to wait too long for a second season.
1	Overall, up until.the 7th episode I was willing to ignore the flaws and holes and felt it was a decent 7 star show. Then the last episode and a half happens and I couldnt handle the stupidity of the writing and flaws.First the positives: Aesthetic is great, really feels like an apocalyptic world.Walton Goggims is amazing. As the cowboy and the ghoul, he does an amazing job. His is also the best storyline and I wanted mote.Ella Purnell also put in a solid performance as Sarah especially when she was playing the innocent woman from the shelter. However the horrible writing in the last 2 episodes even wastes her.Now for the Bad:Maximus is a terrible character and the actor who plays him is terrible. Hated him and his storyline.Cringe Writing. If you can shut your brain off and not think about the plot, it can be quite enjoyable. I was able to do thus for 6 episodes but it was too much. Once you get to the end (last episode is by far the worst) and think about the rest of the series, it is a clown show. None of what happens makes any sense, their plans are stupid. Way too many coincidences and writing conveniences. Its a cast world yet characters continually run into each other. Certain storylines go nowhere.This show was not horrible but not good wither. A total mixed bag. The Horrific writing ultimately makes it unrecommendable by me. The shame is with a tighter plot and better writing, this could have been great. By the way, I have never played the games.
0	Having read Patricia Highsmith's Ripley novels, I was looking forward to this miniseries.However, I was very disappointed. I felt that Andrew Scott as Tom Ripley was terrible casting. Ripley is a more youthful character and Andrew Scott is nearing 50 years old - and it shows.I didn't understand why the film was shot in black-and-white, particularly when a large part of the story is set in Italy which is noted for its colour and life. It seemed to be a parody of Film Noir. Too many artistic shots focusing on irrelevant pieces of scenery or props for no apparent reason. Sequences of Ripley walking along reflected in puddles and taken from weird angles for no particular reason. Perhaps the Director or cinematographer was influenced by the third man or one of Humphrey Bogart's Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade films.Any chemistry between Dickie Greenleaf and Tom Ripley seem to be completely missing in this adaptation. All the characters seem to be unlikable with very little to redeem them.Overall, I was very disappointed and I didn't finish the series.
0	I'm on ep 6 and nothing has happened. The fallout games aren't boring so why is the TV series? It's so small in comparison but theyvr completely watered everything down to suit a wider audience than sticking with the lore. Like LOTR they've mismanaged something that could have been brilliant for them. I've seen so far 1 gulper and 4 radroaches. Which makes complete sense since literally everyone complained about FO76 and I don't remember gulpers before then. It seems like a nursery ride compared to the games. The people don't see any real threats. There's 1 small group of raiders. Too much back story and not enough stuff going on in real time. Complete waste of time and money. I do like the cast. Whish is about as good as my reviews gets. Also seeing the sets brought to live is nice but that's it.
0	Makers ruined this great show. Just hated season 8.
1	This is no art in this for sure, not much original stuff, writing is just meh, nothing to keep you excited that much but it sort of felt good and had okay moments. Something to have as a background while you do dishes or something... But as the show goes on it just gets so cringy and filled with clichés. Line after line makes my eyes roll and every story is so predictible. All the cops are just Jessica Fletchering through L. A. bumping into crime every day on and off duty. Solving murders in minutes, getting shot at few times a day with no conequences. It just gets worse with time and I am only on season 2. I don't think I will be able to go through it until the end. Shame...
1	I enjoyed the first 4 episodes. They were intriguing and exciting. I was invested in the story and the characters (except Auggie, character does not make any sense) but then it turned into a soap opera about that guy fighthing his cancer and friends being friends and whatnot. Unecessary emotional dialogues and scenes.I enjoyed however the concept of the first 4 episodes and their intensity especially when they were inside the game. Good effects overall except for the stupid boat scene.I thought maybe finally Netflix produced something decent finally but nah. They can't keep a good story going.
1	There is the makings of a good show here. However the scientists are supposed to be the most intelligent people on the planet but make the most stupid decision. Furthermore they are incredibly un-likeable.The best characters are the other characters who bring some depth and interest to the show.It's also rather slow. It needs a bit faster pacing and some more interesting characters that are likeable. I hope that the second season is far more interesting and has some really good exciting episodes that raise the bar and has some really good cliff hangers and jaw dropping moments. Which is expected by these producers.
1	"I'm watching season 1 in 2024 and I think the tv show is entertaining, the characters and acting are OK.But theres something about the show that makes me think it is watered down/with little depth.For example: If I watch the first 10m of an episode and do something else for 20m, I would still probably not miss anything important when I got back.About the tv show being cheap, just in season 1 I already saw the same apartment building floor made of plywood (literally plywood, if you pay enough attention) being used in multiple episodes with different wall colorsTheres other stuff too, but my point is that the tv show looks ""cheap"" and they dont WANT to it have any depth, its like it is made on purpose - the tv show is disposable; you watch just to pass the time and you forget about it in a little while.For some people this is good. Not for me. I gave up before finishing the first season."
2	The cast of Firefly have all moved on to have fabulous careers. Nathan Fillion stars as John Nolan in this police procedural in a group of probationary cops each working with a training officer. Nolan is different since all the others are the conventional twenty-somethings and he is starting a second career later in life.This is an interesting proposition and the first two seasons successfully explore the dynamic of his differences - physically less able, more empathetic due to life-experience, suspicion (is it a game or is he committed). Season 3 lost its way a little as the Rookie element receded, but it has reinvented itself as more of an ensemble relationship-procedural in season 4. This added to the introduction of some new rookie characters has given it longevity.An enjoyable show, it will not win any awards, but I look out for it each week. Started with 8* downgraded to 7*.
2	Too many reviews here are being unfairly critical of this newest adaptation considering the source material. There is a prior adaptation from Tencent films but no English translations just subtitles.The main characters are simplified in both origin (except Ye Winji) and interactions prior to involvement in the war. Coming from the books, what we have been given in season 1 is only a foundation of the series. There is a plethora of more to come, if the show goes through all three books (fingers crossed). There has been some backlash from Chinese news agencies who are harsh on the DEI/diversity of characters, meaning there was an extensive array of both male/female, including making book male characters into females, but also check boxing each race/ethnicity. Which is a valid argument considering the source material is almost all Chinese characters, except for Wade and the other Wallfacers.Where this show shines is the CGI! From the VR worlds of the Trisolaris, to the representation of the Sophon and the Eye in the Sky and least of all the end of Judgement Day. That episode alone was amazing from the practical effects (little paper dolls being invisibily sliced) to the grand effects (the whole ship essentially melting into a pile of scrap on the canal beach).
0	The show was a surprise. Good characters, well acted. Enjoyable. The fact that there were only two white characters, was in no way an issue. America is a land of immigrants. We are all mixed.Each character treated as a person. Not a shade. Then season 3. Wow. Oh. Let's throw some left wing PC race baiting hate in to every scene. A chap wants to help a community by changing light bulbs in a kids park. He's a white saviour. They lock the gates to a kids play area because of drug users. But the community does sweet f all to stop it. A white guy tries to help. He's razist.I'm bi racial. Mixed race in the UK, I don't hate my father. My mother is not a victim of the evil white man. I don't know how painting all brown people as victims helps. It's pathetic. In every show now it's added. It's so odd. So victimhood. So divisive. Like Brave heart in the uk. Divisive.
0	When will Netflix learn to quality control these directors adaptions. How many great novels will they be allowed to destroy. The speed of the plot has been rushed with no time to get to know the characters and understand the novels plot building. The casting was also very poor with the majority of the cast coming from Game of Thrones. Did they come with a knock down price as a group. I really don't understand why they need to have people smoking everywhere, are they being paid by the tobacco industry in advertising. They make it unnecessarily appealing to younger people that smoking i.e. Killing yourself is acceptable.
2	This has the potential to be a good show. The only problem is people need not compare this show to Castle.
2	Did they miss the point ?I love this show, so won't mark it down but my oh my did the writers of season 8 not actually see the point of it all ?Throughout this entire show, there as only ever been one threat, the real threat. The Night King and the army of the dead. Maybe it is just my interpretation but he represented something that we can all relate to. He was the great leveller, an unstoppable force, something we ignore at our own peril. He was meant to unite them, put aside their petty squabbles and actually face the consequences of their indifference to events taking place outside of their own little worlds. He represented global warming, plastic pollution, mass extinction, ecological disasters on an unprecedented scale, wars, famine and our own indifference to it all. Warnings after warnings had been ignored and he represented pay back. Death itself come to reclaim the entire world.This story was never about the Iron Throne nor who sat on it at the end. Through meticulous character development, beautifully crafted storylines and a world steeped in history, we the viewers were drawn in. We could empathise, like, pity, loath or even love them. We, unlike many of the characters in this show could also see the bigger picture, the ever growing, ominous threat. A threat so horrific, so dreadful that many of the characters, didn't see, refused to see or simply dismissed it and this would ultimately be their downfall. This threat was not a mindless zombie horde, with no goal nor reason, it was the apocalypse. An event so terrible that no matter what had happened prior, no matter how rich, poor, cruel, kind, noble or dreadful they were, their world was doomed.Game of Thrones had one of the greatest platforms of all to get this message across. The Night King should have been allowed to sweep them all aside. Whether they were heroes or villains, it should have made no difference because the message was simple, do something before it is too late. And it was too late !!This show had everything, great settings, great actors and actresses, it even had dragons. More importantly it had the greatest threat we will ever face, us and our inability to recognise and act upon the real threat. Instead the writers of season eight decided to turn this messenger into a stereotype villain, made of ice who could easily be dispatched by a teenage girl with a knife. Girl power, wins the day !!Game of Thrones could have gone out with a huge bang, the message could easily have been put out through far better writing and following where the original storyline was actually heading. Eight seasons and nearly ten years in the making and they simply missed the point to it all.
1	"I really thought after watching this show I was going to come back to IMDB and see a score around 6.7 or 6.8. It looks like that is not the case and by leaving a 7 star review I am going to be in the minority.Here's why I gave it that score; it has appeal to the masses but does little to actually stand out as a piece of cinema. It does capture the many fun details I wanted to see as someone who grew up playing Fallout games, but it fails to break away from the recycled Hollywood template of making a modern day television show. The acting is subpar. Most of it is bad.Walton Goggins and Moises Arias are fantastic. Ella Purnell can carry her weight but didn't particularly stand out. The guy who plays Maximus has a lot of work to do as an actor. Dogmeat did a great job.Overall, this movie felt like another ""Safeway brand"" version of a show that could have been incredibly unique and badass. Some of the scenes were so cringe and hard to watch (ie: the BHOS chanting Maximus name at the end of the show). Like I said, if you like Taylor Swift then you probably liked this show and thought it was badass. If you don't like Taylor Swift and are a cinema connoisseur, then this was enjoyable but at times hard to watch because of the extreme corniness.It was great to finally watch a respectable adaptation of a game that I spent hundreds of hours playing in my youth and still cherish today.A for the adaptation, but a C for the execution."
2	A fantastic and engrossing show, and the stakes of how it begins were entirely unexpected. I was surprised by the overlap with the Protestant/Catholic divide per Spain, and Portugal as it correlated to the English and the time period tied together with this period in Japan.The pilot episode introduces a unique and interesting Englishman who quickly becomes a central character to the storyline and watching how he tries to connect when reaching Japan and being unable to bridge the gap of communication at first was both a brutal and intriguing watch.There are many layers of storyline happening at once and lots of detail specific scenes that capture various sentiments between different types of people as they are all brought into Japanese culture - or in some cases, exposed to Europeans and their empirical mindset. It's interesting to see two very different, and very technically advanced and civilized worlds meet and how their people respond during those interactions gives even more insight into the difficulties posed in life during these times, and across diverse viewpoints.
0	So busy pushing woke politics & policies it has lost its way from its origins. There's no interns any more, just residents.If you want to be lectured, it's still ok. Time to day good bye already.
1	After watching all episodes of the first season all hope that some have voiced after being disappointed with the first one or two episodes are misplaced: the sequences with the young Ye Wenjie are actually one of the best parts of the series: the dark atmosphere and the intensity of the acting of Zine Tseng were a perfect fit. The contemporary crime story around the string of suicides of high profile scientists was a good continuation, not the least because it was carried by two good actors, Liam Cunningham and Benedict Wong. Wong got some more depth and complexity, because he is shown in his interactions with his son, but at the same time these parts don't seem to contribute anything to the main story. Cunningham has to play an important, but very one-dimensional character. But the whole subplot is soon finished and for the viewer the small amount of suspense contained here, is killed by showing us the solution early on. The characters are later reused in a very unconvincing and silly way, basically it seems England has only one leader figure and one police man.The contemporary story line around the group of young geniuses in England which takes up most of the screen time dropped the ball on many levels. The actors are quite uneven in their performance, but even more striking is that some of them are a good fit for their role, while others are painfully unconvincing casting decisions. Eiza González as Auggie Salazar is supposed to be a technical genius, a nerd, but she completely fails to project any cool intelligence. So in those scenes where she has to show emotions or where she is just part of a group of (totally not nerdy) friends, she is convincing, but really fails in making us believe she is an academic and scientists (her impressive beauty is probably more of an obstacle than a plus in this context). Jess Hong as Jin Cheng is much better in doing exactly that. She handles the different aspects of her character and the development of the character very well. Again, the writers are quite clumsy: Though we follow Cheng all the time with her friends, where she is a very normal, emotional and non-academic person, they add a scene with her fiance Raj and his family, where she is suddenly nerdy and socially awkward.Her love story with Alex Sharp as Will Downing is well done from both sides, and Sharp plays the melancholy, self-depracating dying man quite well too. Jovan Adepo as Saul Durand is rather pale and unmemorable. This is not helped by the fact that he is supposed to be especially intelligent, but is quite often rather slow in the uptake.The writing is painfully mediocre. The story centers on some great ideas, but the writers didn't trust the audience to find them interesting enough to tag along, so they filled the screen time up with uninteresting love stories and a lot of moral discussions which don't lead to anything but some self-righteous noise. They don't care about the main plot points at all, probably because they were a given: Why is the distortion of research in physics such a problem? What are the results of the public knowledge of the existence of aliens and of their coming?As we all know, the series is based on one of the best Science Fiction publications of the 21st Century. The novels tell a very wide-ranging story in a scientifically sound manner and always amaze the reader by taking a very broad view. Scientific considerations play just as much a role as sociological ones. All of this is mind-expanding in the best sense of the word. So much intellectuality is of course unacceptable for a television series. But the fact that the authors of the series then cut out so much that the most important plot points are almost incomprehensible, but instead a sweet mash of romance and morality is stirred in, is unnecessary and cannot be excused by the requirements of a television series.All in all this series tells a story, mainly about a group of very beautiful young people and how complicated their love life is. There are also some aliens in it and some incomprehensible stuff about physics, but it is not a lot, so don't worry.
0	Although based on a real story nothing of this feels remotely authentic. The set ups of the missions/cases are mostly ludicrous and still basically everyone messes up even the easiest tasks and operates against what they preached just scenes before and/or throws every last bit of common sense out the cop car window. The plot twists and revelations in the not-case-related backstories of the leads are badly executed both script- and acting-wise. The leads themselves are not particularly likeable either. This is the cop-equivalent to the medicine/treatment displayed in shows like greys anatomy. No idea how this got even a second season.
0	I have watched the first two episodes and as retired LEO, this show drives me crazy. Adam 12 was more realistic. Between the harassment, poor police tactics, cliches, hazing, pumping a shotgun which means running around with an empty and facial hair. The BS rules and all the separate reports is way over the top.
0	If you're just starting to watch the show and intrigued by the smart plotlines, brilliant writing, World building and inner logic of the show. Either stop right now and save yourself the biggest disappointment of your entire tv watching experience, or enjoy it while it lasts for the first 4 amazing seasons and excellent season 6. But please don't look at it as anything but the biggest high budget and nonsensical soap opera you'll ever see as soon as the build-up phase ends.
2	Let me get this out of the way by just saying WOW! The set design and attention to detail is amazing, and they really outdone themselves. Now, regarding the three main characters? I think its paced fantastically for me, the tone with being goofy and weird but then serious is a really good way to pace a show especially when thats fallout's aesthetic. I don't believe there was a single episode (except maybe the vault 4 plotline, which really didn't need to happen). Now for the important part: is it faithful to the source material?Well... Quickfire about things that don't make sense compared to the games: >Shady Sands is not located in the LA >The Boneyard does not have the 700000 ncr citizens it boasted about in Fallout 2 >The Master (Antagonist of fallout 1 who tracked down vaults) is never mentioned in this show at all, his HQ was in LA and its never explained why Vault 4 or Vault 33 were not discovered by him >The Brotherhood of Steel becoming the most powerful faction in the region with seemingly no explanation?(This one could be a mistake or actually tremendously bad for the canon) In one of the episodes its explained that in 2277 began the fall of Shady Sands then a arrow pointing to a nuclear explosion. NV takes place in 2281, so if Shady Sands was destroyed in 2277 it DE canonizes NV completely. However, its shown that their is a year below each of the events in Shady Sands timeline but not one under the explosion, they could easily fix this mistake. Great show overall but it has a lot of lore problems regarding the NCR.
1	Grey's Anatomy started well, but with the time characters became stupid, impatient and sex hungry. The creator of the series decided to give room to gay people but I find it hypocritical the way they are depicted. The hospital gay employees are lesbians and the patients are male gays. So, it seems that it's OK to watch lesbians kissing and making out in bed. But I guess American viewership is not ready to see males kissing and romping, because none of the main male characters are gay, only the patients that come and go. Funny thing, a gay in real life actor in the series was outed as gay and he left the show. I like the racial diversity but the violent subjects seem to be white only.I hope when the Grey's Anatomy ends, there won't be any regret of not ending it sooner due to the weak script of the latter seasons.
2	I just finished binge watching the show. It's not an easy watch. It started out a little lighter but the more it progressed the harder it was to watch. Sexual abuse, mental illness, self destruction and trauma are some of the things that you'll see in the show. It's disturbing to think this is a true story.The acting is phenomenal! I was very impressed with it. You can feel the raw emotion and stress that is going on in the lives of those people. I just can't get past the fact that it's a true story. There's a lot of mental illness and trauma involved. Makes you feel so bad for them. Hope they're all doing better now.
2	"This is episode 2 out of 6. The first episode was kinda meh, the show-runners wasted a lot of time on stereotypical Hollywood fillers you would expect from a second-tier police procedural, but sure, a little reunion here and there wasn't totally superfluous.However, episode 2 is like a badly written version of episode 1, and unexpectedly took the use of fillers to a whole new level, a level unacceptable for GOT. The writers must have really run of ideas to do what is essentially a clip show. Again, this is something you would expect from the last season of Friends or the Office when the main characters would sit around and reminisce about ""remember when you did this and I did that, those were the days, and we've all grown so much since then."" And Arya, are you kidding me? Even though it was foreshadowed like crazy in episode 1, I still had some hope they wouldn't completely destroy years of character development with one gratuitous scene. My god, what a waste of an episode, the Sand Snakes don't look so bad now.Well, at least we can expect a CGI battle next week, I guess we'll see how it goes, but I honestly didn't expect the show to deteriorate to such an extent this season."
0	My first review was taken down. I guess the truth hurts. An absolutely awful series about a guy puttering about aimlessly hour after hour. Nothing of interest and even without the black and white, everything is so drab and lifeless; including all the characters. Scott was great as Moriarty but here he's just another boring dude amongst many boring dudes. On the plus side if you're having trouble sleeping then is the choice show for you. I have to laugh at the ponderous, praising reviews which are sheer lunacy. There is not one moment of entertainment in the first episode and I certainly won't see the rest. Pure trash.
1	Episode 4 is boring as hell, 72 mins is too long for the goal of it .This show start to go down.
1	Please send Owen Hunt far, far away. He is a total a-hole. Whiny or angry all the time. His self righteous attitude is hard to swallow. The narrative is what a nice, honorable, strong man he is but his actions tell a different story. I also can not stand his acting. He is a bobble head with exadurated movements and gestures. There are and were more annoying characters like George, Izzy, Eliza, Maggie, Katherine, Amelia but he is consistent with his crappiness. The stars I took off are because of these and other annoying characters and because so many great ones are gone.
1	8.2? That's a huge exaggeration. Shows like Breaking Bad or Ripley have that rating. The series is okay, it tells an interesting story and addresses important issues, but it's often tedious and tiring. There's too much of the author's self-expression, his reflections and musings. Watching it, I get the feeling that aside from all his complexes and problems, he's just a narcissist. It was exhausting. And it definitely could have been a movie. I love psychological thrillers, and my guilty pleasure is stories about stalkers, yet with this one, I fell asleep twice and fast-forwarded through tiresome or boring scenes three times.
2	"The show is amazing. Beautiful, but, is so disappointing see the characters speaking in Japanese asking for Portuguese interpreters and what you hear is English. So, if you want to be accurate, putting Japanese characters speaking Japanese, why not do the same with Portuguese characters? Since the show targets to be so well portrayed in the particular period, the lack of Portuguese language is disrespectful. Or, should everyone speaks English and simplified the plot related to language barriers. Unfortunately, as a Portuguese speaker, is very strange hearing ""Portuguese"" in English... And I'll not mention the Spanish speaking ""Spanish""... So, it hit the post of great, but still worth to watch it ( and it's way easier if you don't speak Portuguese at all)."
0	As a fortunate reader of the original novel by Liu CiXin, and a devoted fan of the series, I couldn't help but feel thoroughly disappointed by this adaptation.I will not compare this TV show with the original novel, because it is not worthy, and everyone who rtead the book would agree with me. But even when compared to the Chinese version, it falls short in terms of storytelling, pacing, character development, narrative comprehension, and thematic focus. There are numerous instances where not only does it fail to respect the principles of the novel, but it also muddles even the most basic of logic.Can someone explain to me why we have characters like Auggie Salazar, Will Downing, Saul Durand, Jack Rooney and Raj Varma? Bringing negative effect to this show is the purpose?It's hard to fathom how such a promising novel could be translated into something like this.
0	"Game of Thrones used to be one of my favourite shows on television. It was the perfect fantasy story with complex and detailed stories with characters that you actually cared about, along with simply fantastic writing and good acting with a great sense of tension. However, ever since Season 4 ended, the show has taken a rather significant hit in quality, and it soon went from being fantastic to good and then good to straight up idiotic. While Season 5 and 6 weren't the worst, and Season 7 didn't really have my blood boiling, there was a definitely recognisable change in the writing and plots. It stopped being as sophisticated and became straight up average. All that was saving it was the other good things about the show like the visuals, characters, tension and drama. But now we're here, at the final season:Game of Thrones Season 8 is one of the worst seasons of any TV show I have ever watched in my entire life. It throws everything you ever cared about with this show out the window for cheap expectation subversions, it completely shatters and throws aside character arcs that you have wanted resolved, it completely destroys many of the characters you once loved, the writing has gotten to a whole new level of atrocious with D&D giving excuses like ""Oh they just forgot about them"" to justify it, it is filled with plot holes and contrivances, ex-machinas, and so many impressively dumb moments and deaths that make The Last Jedi look like Citizen Kane. This is The Last Jedi of GOT, it ruins everything you have ever loved about it, it disregards the fact that you have loved this show for nearly a decade just so it can get away with wrapping up the story in a way that even the actors of the damn show hate.I have never seen a TV show get affected by Seasonal rot THIS HARD. A once truly terrific show bogged down due to horrible writing, and they're not even going to up their game for the ending. Years of watching this show that I'll never be able to get back. Thanks D&D, or should we start calling you Dumb and Dumber? Try not to ruin Star Wars next."
0	Loved the 1st and the 2nd seasons, because they dealt with People.Absolutely hate the 3rd one, because it serves agendas, tries to force ideologies and completely destroys the suspension of disbelief.Absolutely terrible.
1	"3 body problem is an interesting sci-fi premise wherein a advanced alien civilization has telegraphed their intentions to conquer earth in 400 years time, and have sent omnipotent spy computers to watch our every move as well as to engage in psychological warfare, in an effort to claim earth for themselves.After a decent first three episodes, the show falls off a cliff, there are casting problems, writing problems, such as why are British involved? Britian has no space program in real life, no natural resources etc. If Aliens arrived Britain would be a trivial country, - so poor scifi there as its not realistic in the slightest.Then there are two women cast in important roles as leading scientists, one of the actors has had obvious cosmetic surgery and is sporting pornstar lips, while being cast as having invented some gobbldygook mcguffin weapon, its ludicrous. The other scientist is poorly developed and is herself just a mcguffin for the cancer sidestory.Oh yeah, there's a cancer death, long and drawn out, so you can enjoy that ride.The final ""twist"" is that a somewhat disinterested scientist is given immense power by the UN (How exactly?) to prepare earth for invasion. I found this to be very lazy and really the second half of the show just never really picks up.If Aliens did as the show premised, then it would have been interesting to see how the UN achieves it's new immense power, to supercede laws and assume a role as World Government, but the show thinks you are a bit dim, so they just did it OK? Also hilarious to see the UN Secretary Gen cast as an American black lady. In the end this is a muddled show, with pacing and writing issues. The writing is dumbed down, as is to be expected by contemporary cinema, and the plot with the ultimately facile cancer story started to drone on about half way through.No real standout performances, but couldn't get over the British Royal Navy (who can't even float an air craft carrier) getting involved. Britian in the 21st century is not a Naval, Space, or geopolitical force, so it was a tough ask to believe the fantasy that the Royal Navy would have any real role, or humanist intention for that matter. Perhaps if the show was made 15 years ago this would have been a plausible scifi outcome, but unfortunately it seems really really dated. The most important goverments in the event of an Alien invasion would be the US, China, Russia, Brazil, India, and Australia. Tiny countries like the UK and Estonia would just be hangers on the to decisions and actions taken by Great Power countries, and I was surprised to see this ""adaptation"" stretch credulity like that when there is, to be fair, lots of juicy scifi concepts all over the show - probably its biggest strength. More needed to happen this season, and ultimately the show disappoints despite having lots of potential."
2	It's not often that you see a unique show these days but this is unmatched.I had settled in for a black comedy about a stalker and her victim, expecting nothing more that some tongue-in-cheek humour and big acting of almost caricature parts. I was so wrong and I couldn't be happier about it.Every episode delivered layer upon layer, rising turmoil, revelatory horrors and gut wrenching spirals. Gadd is phenomenal and draws upon the truth of this story as its victim, to deliver a stunning performance.Gunning's portrayal of the obsessive stalker gave Gadd everything he needed to work with. I felt I was in Gadd's head every time she was on screen - the sympathy, the anger, the fear.This is a stand-out show of the year so far for me. It's a challenge to watch at its darkest, will make you well up at its saddest and beam with joy at its best. That final scene will stick with me for a long while.
1	Exceptional till season 5 starts to go down hill with season 6 and 7 and gets very bad in season 8
0	The conclusion of the series is nothing short of awful. Watch the first 6 seasons and read the books. The showrunners has done their best to make It as bad as possible.
2	I love this series. I've been re-watching it for a dozen times. For me, the first 10 season were great. But for now, it's been going on for tooooo long. I think 18 season is more than enough. The old casts were great, they have a strong character and the way they represent it made me feel like I know them, and sometimes I even miss them. But for the new casts? Hmm.
0	From the very first episode, this series has been setting up great expectations and delivering more than I could imagine. It begins with slowly and naturally introducing us to the ton of characters in the show, all the while keeping us hooked on to amazing story. This has everything one could hope for in a show and more. The brilliant world created here has kings, warriors, slaves, giants, beasts, magic and what not, and yet seems very real. Every action has consequences. I guess this justifies why it took George R.R Martin so many years to write the books these are based on. Everything about the show is wonderful- that is untill they ran out of the story from the books. I haven't read the books this is based on. But I could clearly feel that some thing has changed drastically since season 6. This series suddenly seemed like any other series. For me, the show has been severely degrading since then. There have been some great moments and good episodes. But the over all story seems random. It feels like they are planning these great moments and fights, and then randomly connecting the dots in between. It is very frustrating to see such an awesome show end so badly.
2	Started the series out of boredom with lower expectations than you can imagine but am genuinely impressed by the show in all aspects. I've loved the games since a kid but purely for gameplay/aesthetics so above all else I was surprised how great the storytelling of it all is, nuance and depth are actually used in how they present the many factions in universe and not even in some bland centrist way either. My only criticism is the egregious levels of fan service at times but at least it's usually subtle so not too obnoxious. The political themes from the games are even well presented, always felt like some subtly is missed by many fans but it's all in your face here.
0	Hoping George R.R Martin take part in this show. D.B have destroyed souls of all the characters. The crews are superficial. GOT can be much better than this. So disappointed.
2	First off, I used to have a 10/10 for the show but after watching season 8 ep 3, I can no longer consider it a masterpiece. The writing has been atrocious, no spacing between major moments. Season 8 is definitely going to be the worst season in GOT history, even if the last two eps are Brilliant which I'm starting to feel is highly unlikely. However I'm still giving GOT as a whole 8/10 because of what the show once was, but season 8 has ruined it. Their best hope now is to hire some new writers and redo season eight with 10 episodes, so key moments are spaced out and not feel all jumbled together like they do currently, and give more justice to the night king so that GOT can go out with a bang and be remembered as the greatest show that ever was, like it was supposed to.
1	That is basically the gist of it. Like in any police series, way too many things happen in one episode and the rookies experience more shootings and heavy crime than most police in many life times.The bad writing is mostly about how the leave of people from the show is dealt with. They might get a short farewell, but then they are gone and nobody thinks about them anymore for more than one episode. That lacks. Also the writers make quite many characters spill deep wisdom out of the blue that usually takes a life-time to acquire and therefore the only one who doesn't look silly doing it, is the Sergeant. Also it is not credible that the receiving end always follows this advise given. Also it is silly how the relationships that end in the show never have a fall-out.
1	"Before watching this and even before reviewing i did not know this was based off a book, therefor this review will be based off those experiences.The first 3-4 episodes are good, enticing and suspenseful sci-fi style episodes. I was drawn in and committed to the story. The element of mystery is very strong and compelling making you want to see where this goes.Then it falls of a cliff and flatlines like a vast ocean against a mountain (kinda like a certain scene funny enough). It turns into a day's of our lives drama touchy touchy feel good look at me show and you begin to think to yourself ""This is not what i signed up for, what am i even watching anymore"".There is a scene/event that happens in episode 5 which is just crazy and brings the show briefly back to extremely interesting, but this is just a mere spike before flatlining again, never really picking back up until finally falling off into oblivion.Maybe based on the books it will pick back up in season 2, but i am reviewing season 1 from a blind perspective and frankly will only watch season 2 if i'm desperate."
1	After watching the first season, I can say it was well-done, of high quality and enjoyable enough.Perhaps I was not the target audience, or perhaps everything was too foreshadowed such that I dont recall being surprised by anything. Or perhaps it was the times the show seemed to break its own rules.. I am not sure, but I dont feel as impressed as I should be which is weird.I will still check out season 2, and did enjoy it. The quality is certainly worthy of the 8.7 score it currently has, but ... it just feels like something was missing. Its hard to say, but I really only enjoyed it like a 6 or 7 out of 10..still check it out, people seem to love it.
1	Game of thrones, In other words the best T.V show ever until D&D gone mad. They threw away characters development, logical events leading up to other logical events, well written dialogues, And many separated POV characters just to focus on three characters. But hay All thanks for the adaptation, thanks to an amazing staff and crew for everything done. Farewell GoT <3.
1	This series is a 4k Black & white, Slow paced, dark thriller series but it can be considered as mild one. Its really tough to make these kind of classic times series. Every location speaks its own own presence. To all the photography lovers, those who knows about different photography genres, will definitely love the glimpse of ansel Adam's architectural photography styled cinematography. Top notch direction & cinematography. Slow paced, engaging. Surely u will fall in love with the European architecture. Director is an elite professional as he knows very well how to let this slow series sinks in. Actors are superb too. 👍🏼👍🏼
1	Abrupt ending to the series. Without too many spoilers; there are time-jumps in the final episode between whats now the past and the present where we meet an old decrepit Blackthorn in his final days back at his home in England with his grandchildren marvelling at his worn and chipped katana. However theres no further development in the plot to how he gets back or when he does and how this scene is relevant to the events in Japan. Jump back to Japan, many of the major characters are dead and the story concludes with Toranaga preparing for the final battle against Ishido, with many developments left untreated such as Blackthorns canon training or why Toranaga granted plots to the Christian priests and courtesans in close proximity to each other, whether it was unwitting or a deliberatly plotted move.
0	Since parts of season 6, this has been simply put horrible. Till the end of 5 I'd have given this 9/10 for story, effects and cinematography. The ending was just incredibly cheesy... Every character didn't evolve not the Queen of Dragons either as Tyrion mentioned in the trial. As far as the end and Aegon Jon Snow Targaryen...the rightful air...I couldn't see anything more ridiculous. May as well have the drowned God resurrect Theon. A childish show with murder and nudity.
0	"Grey's Anatomy is one of the most horrible shows I've ever laid my eyes on. I think in some parts it started out good, but then it just spiraled out into some kind of soapy-over-dramatic, snooze fest- and that's putting it lightly. There are so many more shows that are more deserving of all the acclaim that Grey's Anatomy gets all the time. I think it's just one of those shows that is ""popular,"" but not really that good. Doctor shows like House are much better, because they don't value the doctors over the patients, which Grey's Anatomy tends to do all the time. It's a shame that people are blind to all the flaws this show has."
1	"This show is difficult for me to review cause from a technical standpoint it's amazing. The acting, direction, pacing, and writing are all amazing. I was gripped from the beginning. But then it transformed into something I was certainly not expecting in the 4th episode. I've finished the whole show and I feel icky. It's not the sexual violence and rape that has me most unsettled but the depiction of Richard ""Donny"" and his own mental illness. I can't help but feel like this show is a self indulgent public lashing. Everyone is praising him for being so raw and brave tackling sexual violence and grooming. On one hand I appreciate his willingness to be honest with the depiction of himself warts and all. On the other hand, this is a true story depicting his personal true story graphic rapes, sexual promiscuity and deep-seeded sexual confusion/unhealthy behaviors stemming from his abuser, graphic drug abuse, lies, narcissism, soul crushing insecurity, public embarrassment, deeply unhealthy relationships with stalker and others near him, and more. Where he went, disaster followed. I'm not saying that these things don't happen in life. But I'm not sure it's meant to be prettied up on a high rated Netflix show and herald as entertainment. I screamed at the screen multiple times for him to go to a therapist. If this was a fictional story maybe I'd feel differently, but it's not. And at the end of it the conclusion of all his trials there's nothing to glean from it. I'm left feeling empty, sick, and deeply sad for him. I hope he can truly seek help."
0	Those who worked on the props, the sets, the costumes and those who tried their best to act hard for this deserve applause.The writers however should have been locked in a room with a few copies of Fallout 1-4 and not allowed near a word processor till they understood the setting properly. Or learned how to write satisfying narrative and well made characters.Video game adaptations can be great. Castlevania for example was a case of beautifully constructed writing, characterisation and faithfulness to a fanbase and setting that was rewarded with adoration by the fans, myself included. This was not that.I watched the entire thing. This felt like a show written by people who had a vague idea and exposure to what Fallout is, but who were ultimately awful at writing characters you want to see more of. Goggins Ghoul does his best to save the show.They scattered endless member berries throughout the show to evoke reactions of 'dontcha remember this from the game?!'... 'Oh look, he said 'war never changes'!... dontcha remember that? That power armour was cool wasn't it?!'. It's gratuitous and overbears the entire show, because it's the only way to hide the sheer foul stench from the writing.The power armour was cool.It looks like Fallout. It sounds like fallout. It smells like something Dogmeat left for you.
2	I never played the game, but when i saw a trailer of this series my attention was caught. For me it's a mix of Star Wars, The Last of Us, Alien and The Walking Dead. Sure the storyline is pretty straight on, with no difficult timelines or whatever (like 'Dark' or '1899'). But boy it's entertaining and somehow it's keeps you hooked. The visuals are great, acting it pretty good and the story never gets slow. Lucy is a likable main character, not to strong and with human naiveties.You can sense it's a game adaption with all the hardcore action and arcade / over the top shootings, but not in a way your'e looking at a B movie or something.
2	"I haven't played the games and after few episodes, I started to wonder this looks somewhat similar to Silo (2023) TV Series and since the first game came out in 90s, did that show ""borrow"" ideas from the game but then reading some trivia, found out this show's story and plot is completely different than the games others than characters, setting and perhaps few references here and there.Great series, enjoyed the characters and despite being very heavy emotional typical dark dystopian future for humanity it had it's moments of mild humor too.One ""secret"" I really would like to find out is, HOW to stay and look in pristine condition while mostly walking around for miles in a wasteland filled with deserts and radiation affected plant life. Lucy, one of the lead female character, had ZERO marks anywhere on her face, her uniform always stayed in mint condition and even her hair were not only neatly tied up all the time but stayed shiny as if she just had her hair done by a professional. The ONLY little mark shown on her face was that minor cut on her lips that happened during one of the action sequences.I would love to know the secret of staying like that, it must be some sort of magic in future, right? It simply can't be a ""Hollywood"" magic...."
0	I deleted the series schedule today. I followed the great writing and acting for years but now, it's nothing but a politically charged melodrama. Goodbye to a great series.
2	"Believe the hype-Netflix's ""Baby Reindeer"" is an absolute masterpiece that grips you from the very first scene and doesn't let go. Adapted from Richard Gadd's riveting true-life stage play, which first captivated audiences at the 2019 Edinburgh Fringe, the series thrusts viewers into a tense and disturbing narrative. It centers on a man haunted by an obsessive stalker, weaving this thread into a larger tapestry of buried trauma and personal demons. The tension is relentless, keeping you on the edge of your seat as the story unfolds with a chilling precision that's both rare and riveting. It's the kind of show you find yourself watching in one sitting because turning it off simply isn't an option.The series' strength lies not just in its gripping plot but in its deep, raw portrayal of loneliness and the human yearning for connection-themes that echo another Netflix masterpiece, ""Beef."" Both series skillfully dissect the complexities of brokenness and toxic relationships, but ""Baby Reindeer"" distinguishes itself with its raw and flawless execution of human traumas and connections formed in that dark space. Each moment is crafted with an exquisite balance of beauty and darkness, making it a tough, yet utterly compelling watch. This blend of harrowing storytelling and brilliant visual storytelling cements ""Baby Reindeer"" as more than just entertainment; it's a profound experience that sticks with you, long after the screen goes dark."
1	"The first 5 Seasons of Game Of Thrones are exceptional, a beautifully structured series. The sets, characters, pacing, twists - exceptional. I could not fault it, however, after that things went downhill.When it came to Season 5, the author of the books (George R. R. Martin) and HBO had a disagreement. Martin wanted the show to run across more series, to give all his complex story lines the chance to grow & move at a natural pace. HBO declined and so he dropped off the project, which is extremely evident.Season 6 & 7, although flawed, were still watchable. The books & George's earlier comments paved the way for both seasons, but you could feel that the episodes lacked substance.This brings us to the latest season, and after 2 years of waiting expectations were very high. The first two episodes were very plain, the reunions were wonderful, however you could tell they were setting up for one of the biggest fights of the series, which had been greatly anticipated since Season 1. I tried to not to have too high of expectations, however the director referred to episode 3 as ""bigger than Helms Deep"" which is a comment that will always spark excitement.Episode 3 was so utterly disappointing, in every way. If you were somehow able to see through the intense darkness (what was the director thinking?) you will crumble to the poor decisions made by writers. I will not stem into this too much, but basically Dan & Dave chose to go down the Hollywood path, completely disregarding any real story or strategy. Episode 4 was equally as disappointing, which I was hoping would redeem the final season.The writers have ruined this final season by fast tracking characters (basically teleporting), making the smartest of characters docile, and letting plot armor protect 'favorites'. I am still going to watch until the end, but I thought I would warn any future viewer to prepare yourself, as there is nothing more heartbreaking than watching terrible writing ruin a otherwise tremendous series."
0	"If you've read the original book, you'll know how terribly this adaptation has been done, it's a waste of such a great Three-Body Universe.After watching all eight episodes, the biggest overall feeling is that this drama seems to be quite superficial. The production team neither portrays the brutal reality faced by the Three-Body civilization nor adequately presents the impact of the sophons on human science. Even the part about ""the bugs have never been eradicated"" at the end doesn't resonate much. The fundamental reason is that, in eight episodes (which is roughly equivalent to sixteen episodes in typical Chinese dramas), the story stretches all the way from the twinkling of the universe to the Wallfacers and the Staircase Project, which results in a lack of detailed portrayal of the characters' emotions and struggles with inner turmoil. However, this is precisely the essence of The Three-Body Problem."
2	This television series appears to be based on the Chinese author Liu Cixin's The Three Body Problem (2008) that later became a Chinese movie in 2023 and likely the English translation by Ken Liu (2014) which won a Hugo Award. The plot switches between the terrifying event during Chinese Cultural revolution and later to the present day with the mysterious death of scientists around the around as well as involving the actual dilemma of predicting the orbital paths of three bodies in space. The Netflix first season is powerful and at times captivating but at the same time concluding with a disappointing inconclusive ending. One of the most original science fiction portrayals in years, 3 Body Problem has some problem with pacing in places, one or two unnecessary subplots, the earlier semi-light tone quickly darkening in later episodes, and a few scenes that really don't much rational sense that perhaps were included more for dramatic effect unlike the more consistently, scientifically, and practically filmed Interstellar (2014). The group ensemble seems less focused and compelling than those found in The Magician (2005) and Threshold (2005) television series and less dynamic than the multi-faceted sci fi television series Fringe (2008). Other outstanding movies with an alien, time themes include The Arrival (2016), the Fountain (2006), and the cult classic Slaughterhouse Five (1972). Nevertheless this series includes some of the most exotic visually titillating set designs and eerie ominous alien features that make the series stand out at times and worth experiencing along with some high emotionally intense dynamics and intimately personal turmoil among characters. Hopefully Season Two will bring better satisfaction that Season One strongly suggests.
1	I have never seen such a bad choice, the choice of Cosmo Jarvis For this series.I am angry about this choice, because I am interested in both the script and the acting of other actors.In other words, the presence of Mr. Jarvis made me stop watching the series.Mr. Jarvis' cold acting, childish tantrums, completely artificial and unbelievable emotions made me unable to sink into the movie.I wish the director would give an explanation about their choice, or if anyone knows, let me know.How can you ruin a first-class series in such a childish way? Again, I say that I am angry about this situation because of my interest in the film and its actors.
1	An American drama made for political correctness. After all, the United States is a country with a predominantly white population, and high-risk units such as the police and the military have more men than women. But is the proportion of black people in this police station too high? There are three main actors who are black, one Chinese, one Latino, and three female police officers. Just to highlight racial equality and gender equality, it's too fake.
1	Like a lot of people I am a Fillion fan. Mostly because of Firefly but I enjoyed Castle too. This does not live up to those shows by any stretch of the imagination. I'm not sure what the people giving this a 10 are used to watching but this is a 6 at best and thats with 2 free points for Fillion. 2 episodes in and I'm out.
2	High quality story and acting. Very enjoyable Love the humer, not taking itself too seriously, but still engaging and interesting. Not stupid.
0	This final season has been absolute trash and is unfair to fans who have spent money and been following the show from the beginning. We are owed more than this. Rushed with poor writing.
0	"Video game adaptations are everywhere nowadays, most of them are horrible. This one is one of the worst out there.You take a game series, make a TV show version of it, declare it to be a ""canon"" continuation of the games and let a bunch of Marvel loving redditors with Liberal arts degree write for it, what is the result?The result is a show that shows zero respect for the original games, contradicting them left and right, laughably bad writing where even the tiniest amount of thinking makes the whole show fall apart, and of course, a show stuffed full with current day propaganda, much like the vast majority of everything that comes out nowadays, with incompetent ehite males, goofy weak black males, Mary sue protagonist, pregnant woman mowing down raiders while laughing manically, WOW! So badass guys!, remember that scene whenever someone tells you this series is mature. Tiny FtM creature who's stronger than actual men and looks more uncanny than any of the ghouls... I could go on, this was all just in the FIRST episode by the way.The writing itself is beyond awful, the conflicts are reliant on every character being an idiot. Not to mention a lot of scenes are just stupid, they outrun a nuke by riding on a horse come on.The choreography and cinematography are amateurish, awkward camera angels, and any scene that has someone punching someone else doesn't even look like the guy's being hit by the punch and the CGI is really bad.The humor is straight out of reddit and Marvel, that wouldn't feel out of place in a modern Disney movie...I swear there's so much wrong with this that I could list them here all day long, but long story short, don't watch this. Just don't. Everyone who recommended this to you on YouTube or whatever has previously hated very similar shows to it, but this one gets praised because we don't have any standards anymore and anyone will sing praises of any awful piece of media if they're paid well enough."
0	"I just don't get this show at all. A friend of mine who shares similar TV tastes with me suggested I buy the DVD set because this would be a show I'd really love. Well, I couldn't even get through half of the first disk! The characters are shallow, the stories are moronic and th writing level is something on par with 4th grade. There is nothing believable or redeeming about anything or anyone on this show. Ther is no humanness to the characters to hook on to. In short, I could not care less about one of the regulars on this show.It comes across as some ""C"" level writer's idea of pithy cool writing and instead, it's predictable, dumb and uninteresting. Not sure what the fuss is about and I do not know how this show has stayed on the air!"
0	Sadly overacted, unrealistic, predictable series with 10 carbon copies of one character. The surgeons & residents all stammer, grow speechless, have the same tone, similar reactions, lines, mannerisms, tears streaming down their faces... and these are doctors in a hospital. Have the show's creators and writers ever been in a hospital? It's all unheard of.I worked in a hospital with surgeons for 7 years and never ever saw one of them cry or scream of grow out of control the way these characters do every day on the job. It's totally ludicrous - doctors are very cool-headed in their work, to the point of almost lacking compassion at all - especially surgeons. They are criticized for being totally heartless, but you have to be to cut into human flesh. THey are never melodramatic the way ALL of the characters on this show are... not to mention the rotating bed partners and switching up sexuality -- although most surgeons are sleaze-bags, the philandering is usually with nurses, not with other doctors and never same-sex. Grays features all kinds of unrealistic craziness. Please give the American public a break and stop producing and airing this silly junk.
0	"No spoilers.I read the books when they first came out and watched the show from the start. The first three seasons based off the books are a masterpiece. Sadly because the books weren't finished the show takes a radical direction from then on with a lot less character development and more action and CGI. Seasons 4 and 5 still had many pointers from the author George RR Martin, so they are okay but not as good as the first three. At seasons 6 and 7 plot holes start to appear and characters teleport around the world wherever the script needs them, doing uncharacteristic things or having their story arc end with a fizzle. Character development has completely ended and the show priority is action and CGI above everything.Season 8 the final season could be from a completely different show. The developed characters change in intelligence and personality. The script changes established sub plots and character arcs because as the script writers stated on record, ""They wanted to shock the audience and do something completely different.""Well recording over the end of a film with a comedy sketch like this is a VHS video tape is shocking and completely unexpected, but not for good reasons!The final season is so alien to the whole world design and established story arc that it really doesn't fit in with anything in previous seasons. It's shallow, rushed, badly written and destroys almost a decade of good television just for shock value. It ruins any replay value in the whole series that there just isn't any point in watching it again. There are many subplots that lead to dead ends, unanswered questions, character changes that don't match the characters natural progression in the past 7 seasons and then there are the sloppy edits and continuity errors like plastic water bottles on set or a Starbucks coffee cup at a medieval feast in plain sight. Battles that make no sense, tactics that don't work, plot armour and fan fiction, armies that die to a last in a desperate stand of a few dozen, only to respawn like new in the very next episode. Weapons that magically work or don't work depending on the new plot the useless script writers come up with next. Wounds that a fatal suddenly becoming a but a scratch and characters gaining superpowers like flight, invisibility and invulnerability. A fantasy show that was great because it prided itself on not doing fantasy tropes suddenly does every fantasy trope in the book. Everything about this final season is rushed and sloppy and a mess. You would be better off pretending season 8 didn't exist. It will ruin everything you have watched up to that point. I can't even begin to cover all the problems with each episode. There are plenty of YouTube channels that go into detail with all the discrepancies and problems of each episode. Seasons 6 and 7 aren't great but are still watchable. But season 8 is not even watchable. Do yourself a favour and don't watch it. You will find only disappointment and frustration.If the show ended at season 3 it would be a 10/10. If it ended at season 5 it would be an 8/10, at season 7 it would be a 6.9/10 but with season 8 it's about a 3/10 and those three points are for the acting and set design. The story is destroyed and the show is no longer worth watching on repeat. I'm so disappointed with that final season. They delayed the release for two years and yet didn't spend ten minutes of those two years editing and cleaning it up the errors and rushed plots to even resemble some form of quality. They treated it like printing money from a brand name while putting minimal effort in."
0	"I've been a massive fan of the games. Put hundreds and hundreds of hours into them. So I'm familiar with the quirky world and sometimes dark characters and situations. And the games are also violent. But SERIOUSLY. People who find this level of absurd gore and ultraviolence entertaining are disturbed individuals. The makers of this show just want it to be ""The Boys"", but why can't it just be Fallout? You've already got an extremely popular, highly beloved franchise with an incredibly rich world to play in. This show could be incredible. It takes some special people to turn such a sure thing into garbage."
0	"Amazon Prime's ""Fallout"" series emerges as a vivid tableau of the beloved video game's universe, repackaged with a distinctively modern twist that seems tailored specifically for a Gen Z audience. Helmed by Lisa Joy of ""Westworld"" fame and Geneva Robertson-Dworet, known for her ventures into action-packed science fiction, the series injects a youthful vibrancy into the bleakness of post-apocalyptic survival. However, this injection skews the narrative, favoring contemporary issues and stylistic flourishes that resonate more with new viewers rather than purists of the ""Fallout"" franchise.The result is a series that feels fundamentally disjointed; it's slick and stylized, with an aesthetic and thematic overhaul meant to appeal to younger viewers who appreciate rapid-paced storytelling and visually driven narratives. This focus on style over substance and an evident preference for melodramatic over meaningful character development suggests a misalignment with the original spirit of ""Fallout."" Such a directional shift might capture the fleeting attention of Gen Z viewers, yet it leaves longtime fans of the series alienated, underscoring a generational divide in both the interpretation and appreciation of what makes ""Fallout"" fundamentally compelling. This version of ""Fallout,"" while visually arresting, suggests that sometimes a shared name might be the only thing a adaptation retains from its source material, turning a potentially rich narrative landscape into mere thematic ruins."
0	The show would probably have a chance if it has taken itself less seriously. You cannot have it both ways, tackling a a subject like this that can be prolonged for many years and seasons, rushing it through the important parts and spending whole episodes on unremarkable cry baby scenes. The main characters are completely insufferable, acting like spoiled teenagers although they are supposedly top notch scientists. It is very difficult to not get frustatrated with them having these behavioural ups and downs while the rest of the cast/world has to put up with them because ... no reason. And that's the biggest problem of the show. Mary Sues and more Mary Sues because nowadays writng an actual hero is so difficult that checking boxes has become the go to pattern.
1	Time to pull the plug. I used to love watching it but know I keep skipping forward. Did Netflix buy this? What's with the lgbt.. propaganda?? All this fake drama. If I wouldn't have watched that many seasons I would have not continued to watch it.
1	"A mild, mostly realistic but artificial representation of that post-apocalyptic city with heavily interlaced 1950s and 22nd-23rd century vibes, devices, equipment and way of life.It feels incomplete, could have been provided with heavier development as to Cooper Howard's radioactive fate, Lucy's father played mysteriously by Kyle MacLachlan and her mother as well.These incomplete stands and ""plot holes"" hurt the series and are taintedly replaced with the Ghoul's charismatic psycho prowesses and pistol whipping. Also, the character of Michael Emerson was hugely wasted, equaling to the weight of his head mostly. Bad decision in my opinion, to say the least.All that I said and unhappily ""complained"" about had just one purpose. The milking of viewers for a second season and making them go berserkly mad at the long wait till 'Fallout II'.In retrospect, please allow me to praise the mostly speedy development and production of this ""future-cult"" show that has the potential to become equal to or even surpass 'Westworld' quality, if they add some more fusion reactions, more engaging character development and blindingly bright orange-white multi-megaton atomic explosions in the series' future.P.

0	I was really looking forward to this new version of Clavell's book as I had enjoyed the Richard Chamberlain version all those years ago.The first 3 episodes I could see that the story was developing, albeit at a slow almost glacial pace, and was looking forward to something happening.However that pace I mentioned earlier slowed, if such a thing were possible, and I found myself getting bored, to the point where I was beginning to envy those cast members who managed to get out early by committing seppuku. I presume had that written in their contracts after reading the script.Nothing happened, literally nothing, we saw the same conversations, and whilst some high minded critics might refer to that being 'nuanced' anyone else looking to be entertained would call it repetitive.Suffice to say the series was a disappointment and how any reviewer on here can give it 10/10 is beyond me, when you compare it to the likes of the Sopranos or Breaking Bad.Simply mind boggling, or perhaps like me they started to doze off.Sayonara.
1	Why why why end this show like that.... so many options but this was by far the worst one. No confrontation with Cersei, quickie to end the winter king, suddenly turned crazy queen, I can keep going on like this. Shame!
2	I wasn't going to write anything about this series simply because I got so heart broken by the terrible ending that never touched my wildest dreams but in a negative way!! If you tell me a year back I would rate this series anything less than an 10 i would've considered you crazy beyond repair but now things has changed and an 8 is a compliment in comparison to the total let down that I recieved from season 8!! Thing is I would've been OK with finishing off the white walkers in one dark episode and if the last two episodes concluded in a decent rational manner i would've accepted the season despite its multiple flaws but to end it the way they did in the last two episodes is pure murder to us viewers and to the name GOT has created for itself through sheer brilliant story telling and execution at the highest level.. There is no need to go on further because after reading a few comments I was aware that it's an almost universal feeling that season 8 was such an ugly shocking let down that one has to live with... Wish they could work on an alternative ending like some movies do and give us all the ending that we crave for with a good pinch of humility and optimism maybe that could heal things a little
1	If you ask me to rate all the first 7 seasons I would give them a total of around 9 but last season deserves a 1
0	Why? I was looking forward to this series, but immediately the show lazily falls to new Hollywood diversity tropes. Smart attractive young diverse female lead looking like a super model doesn't convey intellectual to me. Then the identity of villain is set up from episode one, no surprise another Hollywood trope.Then in the first episode the lead smashes the black guy in the chest. Imagine the shrill hysteria if that was gender reverse.I'll continue to watch and may change my review. I expected so much more from these got legendary show runners but do far is pulp. Maybe JRR held them back from their worst impulses.
0	"I'm sorry I just can't stay ""in"" the movie when they switch locales to the Oxford setting. The Chinese location, actors and subtitles I'm fine with. But then every time we head over to merry olde England I'm reminded that the English are, well, not English. How did Britannia ever survive without people of color to lead the way? It's just tedious to watch their scenes with the overt political ""message"" constantly being slammed upside my head. Enough already. Fail.I can suspend disbelief for science fiction all day long. What I can't do is believe the Oxford Five really exist. I'd prefer it if the whole thing was in Chinese with Chinese actors and dialogue."
1	"Fabulous, artistic photography. Great 'Film noir' photography. But then apparently there was no budget left for scenario, dialogues and professional or more charismatic actors as in former movies based on Patricia Highsmith's great novel such as 'Plein Soleil' (by René Clément with Maurice Ronet, Alain Delon and Marie Laforêt) or ""Mr Ripley"" (by Anthony Minghella with Matt Damon, Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow).This remake of former movies is fully respecting the original story but stretching it out too much. Trying to be mysterious but never catching or just as intrguing as the original story."
2	"This is a great show , people with expectations who have a history with the story , books , just want a recreation of the experience they created for themselves in their own minds. In terms of just being a show created for entertainment this is everything anyone could want, I had no idea what 3 Body Problem ever meant , I had heard of it but had no prior experience with the story.As a ""new"" experience in terms of modern sci-fi this is excellent , covers all the facets required to keep me < at least< enthralled and binge watching into the early hours of the next day.I have read a lot of the reviews which are just whining about their experience not being fulfilled because of expectations , what can we really expect these days ? I didn't expect this and am really happy for finding it and will be telling many more people to watch."
1	Almost finished, and I am annoyed with all the reviews so far.I hate the 10/10's that blindly praise it, and the 1/10's that say it's nothing like the game. I am going to assume that they are only loosely familiar with the franchise, because it seems pretty close to the world that I was expecting. It feels pretty close to fallout in my mind.I also don't love it.The closest negative review was a comment about the graphics. The graphics are rough in spots, but that isn't the problem.The problem is pacing.Very quickly we are introduced with a McGuffin. It's very well handled and the first couple of episodes present it in a very solid way. Then it disappears, say around episode 4.Around episode 4, we are introduced to some much needed background about the world. I like this part as well.So I liked 1-4 and 4-8. Why is there a problem?They are different stories. Season 1 is the first four. Great! Season 2 is the second four? Also great. But make clear arcs.This 100% feels like they were trying to emulate a game here.1-4 is the introduction part of the game. We are, like all games, stuck on the railroad of storytelling that introduces the McGufffin. Then something happens and the world opens up.Some players just grind after the McGuffin and keep it going. Some players wander and explore creepy buildings. I personally explore creepy buildings. It's what I enjoy. It's why I enjoyed the second act. But now I am unsatisfied. I reached the end of six and realized that they were going to be only able to finish one of the two story arcs in the time remaining...Oh...yay... another cliffhanger. I guess I saw it coming at least. Don't get me wrong, I understand the need and they just didn't stick the landing. That 3-6 episode segment is rough.I have no problem with a genuinely episodic show. I have no problem with a major story driven show. But you have to be a masterclass genius to get your cake and eat it.
1	"I generally find ""The Rookie"" enjoyable. Each episode offers well-written interwoven plots that keep me engaged. While using body cameras and vehicle cameras can result in lower video quality, it provides a unique perspective on the action, adding a touch of realism.However, the show has its weaknesses. Jenna Dewan needs to go. I often fast-forward through any scene that she is in.The music is terrible.While Nolan started strong, he seems to have lost some of his appeal, becoming one of the less compelling characters. His actions and facial expressions have become predictable and disappointing.Thankfully, the show boasts several strong personalities who pick up the slack. Lucy and Diaz are standouts, consistently delivering captivating performances. Grey and Bradford are also compelling characters, trailing closely behind in terms of their presence and development. And for those who appreciate eye candy, Dylan Conrique plays a character with undeniable charm.Overall, ""The Rookie"" is a mixed bag. While the concept and some characters remain engaging, certain aspects, like the casting error and lacklustre main character, might leave some viewers wanting more. Still, the series offers solid entertainment for those seeking a cop drama with action, humour, and character-driven stories.Last note: I would have stopped watching long ago if it weren't for Melissa O'Neil (Lucy)."
1	Not as expected.. Watched 4 episode and yet non of them makes you to watch next.. ( you can leave easily on any point of the story) story and character didn't grab you.No thrill or excitement.. If you don't have any choice for time pass then you can go for it.I was really waiting for this but it is really disappointing..So many things doesn't sense at all.. but we can accept that because it's made from video game..No thrill or excitement..

2	The show is good and keeps it's story through all the seasons. I liked all seasons in there own way, but i have to say sometimes the show has real dumb episodes or the characters just do something that is soo like a normal person would never do that, at least in my opinion. These episodes are fine and sometimes make me laugh just for the dumbness (not saying that everything they do is dumb they are normally really smart in this show) of the characters or the thing they're doing but overall a good show with drama and I enjoyed almost every minute of this series. (Very good acting btw so thumbs up for the actors)
0	Ignore the game fans! There will be a lot of 10 star reviews from the game fans saying this is all right and the script and scenes are right, that the music and acgion are righr. Ignore them all, thos is a boring show where the action has no continuity, characters do kot develop, actors cannot act. Bad idea was the one to make this adaptation and it has the same effect as the game, they somehow can hype you up to watch/play it just for you to find out later this is boring and storyline is meaningless. It could be awesome but unfortunately it is not the case. If you need something to make noise in the background so you can fall asleep then its good.
1	Season one was really good but now its starts to feel like NCIS series . Prisoners inside LA . Guns dealing without back up and major bomb attack stoped by rookies is few to mention. Maybe next episode will be about undead Bill Ladden visiting LA . Get real people.Thats why we start watch it in first place...
1	I went into this completely blind--never read the books or saw the Chinese version, and only knew it was a sci-fi show by the guys from GoT. So I had no expectations. I thought it was good, but something was missing that kept it from being great.The production was good, but not inspiring. The acting was good, but I never really felt emotionally connected to the characters, although I came close with Jin. It would have been nice to have more background and world building to become more vested in the story and characters.The plot itself was fine enough, but events seemed to unfold quite quickly without ever showing any effort. A lot happened, but it lacked depth. I thought it was good enough to watch another season, but it didn't really knock my socks off at any point. Good enough, I suppose.
1	"I know we are so small and cant comprehend time and we always say greatest of all time to everything , it could have been one to go down in cinematography history as one of the greatest. It had all the backstory , talent , funding and passionate people that worked there. Like Ned Stark said everything before the word BUT is horse ""beep"" , this one has a big but (no pun intended ) .I kept my rating at 10 stars till season 6 ,even tho season 5 had major issues and there were some nonsensical moments here and there but it truly deserved the 10 star rating anyway till that point . It was pretty obvious by this point GRRM left the train. Conspiracy theories aside ( one was pretty crazy but plausible that Disney had a hand in rushing D&D to wrap up GoT so they can start their new Star wars saga , crazy right ) it felt like everything was getting ridiculously rushed to a point where teleportation was something that might be possible . Funny meme about teleportation there is a mobile game for GoT and guess what you have teleportation scrolls , you can literally teleport your House Keep around the map .Season 6 has some great moments but then slowly but surely the writing goes down hill faster then a Dothraki screamer . Shock value , hollywood cliches and out of character decisions takes hold and grips by the neck everything we used to love about this show tighter then an Dorne viper .Season 7 tells us clearly that everything is out of control now and there is hardly a way back to what it once made everything epic , but for all the fans out there there is still quite a lot of hope , at least i had it going into season 8.Season 8 is exactly that soul crushing, utter disappointment and disgust towards all the major writing decisions and scripts .I am not ungrateful , without D&D and HBO to start it all this story at least for the time being would have been just an amazing story in a book saga (which for a lot of people is enough) therefor I am truly thankful they started all of this BUT for what they have done in the last 2 seasons (at least) i will use the last words of Stannis Baratheon : ""Go on do your Duty"" ..... and be Done with it ...(off screen) ."
1	An obvious product of handing it to multiple writers and directors and making it up as they went. Drastic tonal inconsistency between episodes and plots that take nonsense turns just to somehow justify how some character knows which way to go. The whole thing was improved for me significantly by skipping over all the Brotherhood of Steel stuff though because in the games I always found them obnoxious and sanctimonious and that's sure on point here. And Maximus is NOT a good person. I don't care how much they try to say it in the plot. Enjoy him NEVER not seeming like a whiny little boy. EVER. I honestly hate that characters guts.
2	So everyone knows that season 8 blows. It's common knowledge. For the people who haven't yet seen it, is it worth it to watch anyways?Well, yes and no. I would definitely say for most you can still enjoy the majority of the show. However, if you are the type of person that values the destination MORE than the journey, I would be cautious.Seasons 1-4: 10/10Seasons 5-6: 9/10Season 7: 7/10Season 8: 3/10Seasons 1-6 have some of my favorite moments in storytelling, ever. If you are a fan of intense, gritty realism, intriguing plot, and complex characters, I would definitely still recommend this show, just know what you're getting yourself into.MY WARNING TO THOSE STARTING: DO NOT get too emotionally attached to the show. Enjoy it for its quality alone, and understand WHY the last 2 seasons are not as good. This way you will not be depressed for weeks on end after watching the last season like I was.Let this show be the prime example of how a show goes from some of the most compelling narratives I've ever seen, to absolute trash at the end. From a purely analytical standpoint it is quite fascinating to watch.
0	Frustration is felt when watching a series like Shogun, when the expectation of finding a passionate narrative is quickly replaced by the discomfort caused by the disrespect for the Portuguese language.The great initial enthusiasm that arose when watching the first minutes of the first episode of the Shogun series quickly disappeared when I realized that the characters, supposedly Portuguese, were not speaking Portuguese. Instead, a version of the Portuguese language adapted into English was presented, with the characters communicating in English as if they were speaking Camões' language. This serious linguistic flaw was a huge disappointment and ended up completely compromising my involvement in the narrative.
1	So after what I saw in the finale of the series. I had to edit from 10/10 to 7/10.. season 8 was garbage... they ruin the book the storyline the great conversations and everything. The actors did great job but the writers were miserable in the last episodes.
0	Most probably this is even more childish and stupid than Manifest... Must be 15 year old st the most to not have your intelligence offended after watching, lets say 2 episodes of this thing.I am not much of a reader but I am sure that if I had read the Chinese book from which that crap was adapted I would have a far better experience... Great pity for ex-good actors like Pryce to take part in such farces.No words for the duo-stooges of GoT Beniof and Weiss. Looks like they don't deal with box office success in a good way.All in all, another proof that netflix productions suck , BIG WAY...
0	Same terrible adaptation like GoT. But companies denies the truth that, these dudes are not capable of doing anything good. They love to crap on very good novels and books. I think they dont understand what they read. Because the other option is they dont care. They take whatever is sellable and screw the rest. Actually after GoT failure i thought that these dudes will forgetton forever but nooooo. Here they are doin the same crap again. But not HBO Netflix this time. May be they will try Disney next time. Who knows. With a same hype, another good novel/book will be massacred by these guys. Shame on Netflix.
2	The fact they had Winter's coming, was a big Load of crap. All it was was 7 or 6 seasons leading up to literally one episode of bullcrap. I see they could a lead on the undead fights at least 1 or 2 episodes longer but they decided not to and I feel like every viewer including myself as pretty upset....winter was coming for 6 years and ended in a hour....nice end to that crap
0	The actor Andrew Scott is almost 50 years old and therefore much too old to play 25 year-old Tom Ripley. He looks more like the father of either Marge or Dickie. Who did the terrible casting?Scott also lacks the irresistible charm of Tom Ripley as described in the books. What young people befriend an old man with no charisma nor good looks?Black and white does not make a film or series good. It screams overly pretentious and it annoyed me so much.I've seen both versions with Matt Damon and Alain Delon. They are not perfect either, but I enjoyed them more because both actors were believable and excellent as con artist.Not recommended.
2	"Generally, it's a very well done show. Hard to see such thing these days. Quite entertaining. It basically mixes all the genres you can think of: fantasy, soap opera, crime, mystery, thriller, you name it. Writing is very good, although there are (here and there) plot holes and illogical moments. The big budget shows, but never stands in the way of story telling. Music selection is great (reminds me of Bioshock games 1 nad 2, which came 10 years later). Directions and editing are done routinely, but consistently well. Well done casting and acting, though. I tried to play this game once but gave up after a few hours (I believe it was 4, but forgot: the game was not my cup of tea - too open world, too many dialogues, too many quests and so on: everything ""too many"" for my taste, including bugs in the game). This shows borrows the scenery/visuals and overall atmosphere, but brings a partly original story, leaving a lot of space for many more episodes/seasons, which I'm looking forward to. Very entertaining and immersive. Much better than the game. Obviously, such story is better suited for the tv-show, not the game, but that's a personal opinion. Highly recommended, regardless of games' origin."
0	That's all you need to know. They said the review was too short but there is nothing else to say really. They blew it.
0	"I saw the 1st season. Very very boring. I think I have wasted 10 hours of my life, for nothing, by watching this series. The first episode was a bit promising, but later on nothing. So i saw the rest of the 1st season hoping for some improvement, which never ""came"". The script and the plot is nothing special and very very slow. Casting is also poor except, Sean Bean and Peter Dinklage. The production gave me the impression of a low budget film. Too much blood, without any war scenes. Too many sex scenes probably too boost up the ratings. Compared to the Pilars of the Earth (8 mini TV series), The game of Thrones is at least 3 ""steps"" lower. I really do not understand the IMDb high score of 9.4, No way ! There is no point for me to wait for season 2."
0	Not the same show as it used to be. Not even close. So bad. 0/10.
2	"Despite what that delusional negative reviewer said, I think this show had a great, well written start. Great noir nods with fantastic acting to boot. Farrell turn in his usual stellar performance. The relationship between Sugar is wonderfully interesting, nuanced, and complicated, I guess some people need everything spelled out for them in the first fifteen minutes in order to ""get into it."" The pace isn't lightening quick but I wouldn't call it slow. The plot/set up is hardly groundbreaking, it's a typical neo noir plot, but if you're a fan of that stuff you should enjoy it. Also if you're familiar with old movies in general you should enjoy the many references. Most ""professional"" critics also enjoy it, despite what some people who clearly only read reviews they agree with might claim. I only watched the first two and I'm very excited to see where it goes. It could go bad, I've watched many show that start strong and become a mess but I'm very hopeful. The writer is a pretty solid out of the box thinker (he also wrote The Cell) so that's a good sign."
0	The writing post season 4 is so bad I'd rather nail my eyeballs to a burning cactus than read even a text message from any of the show's writers.How they managed to ruin a show that started so strong is absolutely beyond me. GRRM is not even dead, yet he's turning in his grave.Congratulations D&D on the biggest flop in TV history.
2	A visual masterpiece that captivates You with its meticulous attention to detail in every frame. From the carefully composed shots to the stunning scenery, each scene is a work of art in itself. The monochrome aesthetic adds a layer of sophistication and elegance to the overall visual presentation, creating a unique and mesmerizing atmosphere that sets it apart from other shows.It's a must-watch for anyone who appreciates visually stunning storytelling and nuanced character dynamics. The combination of artistic cinematography, monochrome aesthetic, and compelling character interactions makes it a truly unforgettable viewing experience.
1	For an average rating of 5. This final (for me) season has been garbage. I turned off the season four finale just past the halfway mark because the rest of the episode was both obvious and ludicrous.If it comes bask next season, I won't be watching. I hope it doesn't so that the actors don't waste their time.
1	"I was so excited for this one. Cause I really liked Arcane and Cyberpunk, the Witcher even The Last of Us was decent enough that I did not feel a slog watching through it. Warcraft was not a 10 for me I still liked it.But out of all of these, Fallout has one of the most interesting world in Video games, say what you want about the quality of their later games, but they know how to build the worlds.Fallout TV show starts out great, they go over the skills and you start feeling good about it, but then it all falls a part. I personally think the premise of 3 vaults is not a bad one, but the execution was. There are so many plot holes and the people are made out to be just stupid, that is the biggest crime of all. Everything is so goofy. The outside world looks good but not great, you do get the fallout feeling but is so empty. A girl who comes from a vault and is bright and stupid at the same way, get trough it all like there is no danger at all, always someone there to save her. What was she gonna do, dive after the gulper if Cooper did not kidnap her. There are so many moments like that, plot armor is think on this one.I liked episode 4 and 8 they were the most action packed. But the overall writing is just bad, it just makes no sense. That makes this show for someone who sees things logically a really hard watch, and not logically as everything has to be like in real life, but in the Fallout world logic. In games the protagonist is weak at the beginning but finds things along the way to aid him/her. I was hoping so much she finds something, a melee weapon maybe, nope.Lets talk about vaults, so the vault 33 and 32 are supposed to be puppets for vault 31 management who sends overseers for those two vaults. Jet somehow the vault of 32 dies out 2 years before we see the show and no one knew? Really? And we are supposed to believe that a tiny brain bot that cant even navigate, is somehow the mastermind who controls all of it? Mind you all are wearing pitboys when the supposed raiders from Vault 32 are coming to visit. And none of them detect radiation?Lets talk about the supposed ""Raiders"" you telling me that a woman who wants to heal the world goes into a vault and murders innocent people? Mind you they have a colony of their own where they actually could clean up but they go to the visit all dirty? What about the plot, we see Lucy taking the ""Husband"" to her room where she finds out that he is not from the vaults but outside cause of the radiation warning the pitboy gives. And the vault 32 died out 2 years ago, and what are we supposed to believe that those 2 years someone sat in the overseers computer and set up the marriage some how, plausible but its such a stretch. How did the ""raiders"" suddenly appear in armor and weapons, was no one watching out for the vault, there were no guards? In every fallout world that has people living in the vaults they have guards.I mean I could write double what I have already said about the plot holes and inconsistencies trough out the show, but I think you get the point. I actually think it would have been better not having played the games at all before this, that way I would not have had many questions that might have ruined it for me.The first season ended in a high note for me though, here's to hoping second season mends the mistakes of the first one.Among my friends most people do not like the shows(Travelers, Stranger things, Band of Brothers, Narcos, Arcane, The Umbrella Academy, Blood of Zeus and Game of thrones etc.) that I like and most like the shows that I do not, so maybe this review speaks of just some of the people who are gonna watch it, but for those who have played the games I think this is not the best."
0	In my opinion, the events of this film are full of errors.I think everyone helps the criminal how to finish his mission of killing the victims, In particular the police,the investigators they committed many mistakes that even children do not commit when investigating accused and criminals.The Main actor Tom Ripley treated the police like puppets.I think it would have been better if they had finished the movie in two hours. Sometimes I felt deathly bored, Some of the shots were very slow.The actors played their roles brilliantly, only there was a problem with the direction and script.It is best that you read the novel before watching these episodes.
1	"Being a huge Fallout fan, and having played all games since Fallout 2, I was a bit skeptical. But when I started watching the series, the attention to detail quickly captivated my curiosity. ""Maybe they really paid tribute to the games?"".And yes, they did in my opinion. However, there seems to be a main focus point on sex and breeding, which in itself is fine, but was never mainly important in the games. Also, the fact that the first season is focused on bringing a head somewhere, doesn't give me a 'Fallout' vibe. It was never a main quest in any of the games or side quests that I played, and combined with the first point I made about sex playing a major role it doesn't feel like a true Fallout adaptation.Like I said, the attention to detail is amazing. As well as the fact that most Vaults were mainly used for experimentation. I also love the characters/actors, but somehow I'm still not sold. Even for Fallout, I think the first season is too much over the top and it needs some adjusting.Also, fusion cores don't last forever, which they make it seem like in the series. And 'civil' ghouls never needed a medicine in the games, they either became feral or stayed civil after the Great War."
1	Alright, the film is entertaining, packed with logical fallacies. They argue that Little Red Riding Hood and the wolf don't comprehend lying, while in the previous scene, they accuse the two scientists of lying, who are then dissected. If they grasp quantum elementary particles to such an extent, they could easily resolve the three-body problem, for if there's a stable period, they could transform the two stars into white dwarfs or other celestial bodies. Gravitational anomalies would cease to exist, and stars wouldn't utilize each other as slingshots. Admittedly, the functioning of the solar system likely required the other two stars, but with such knowledge, they would surely have resolved this issue as well. How certain are they that our planet suits them? They assert it's entirely different. Naturally, they could lay claim to any planet in our planetary system; they could relocate to Mars and undoubtedly possess the capability to terraform. It's a somewhat impulsive decision.
0	"Being a sci-fi enthusiast, and having heard of the books long prior to the Netflix series, I was quite hopeful for a great sci-fi, but this is just BAD. The concept itself is quite braindead, along with all the smaller concepts within that make up the whole, and aside from that you have a bunch of contrived and nonsensical drama mechanisms, such as the terminally ill dude who is in love with the lead physicist. All the characters destined to supposedly be key players in an interstellar war to save the human race happen to be good drinking buddies, like it was originally a storyboard for an episode of Scooby-Doo or something. The only saving grace for this series for me was Eiza Gonzalez's ABSOLUTELY EXQUISITE MOUTH. What an insanely gorgeous actress! And not a bad actress at that, but hardly good enough to salvage a trainwreck of a series idea like this. I'm not even sure this is any kind of issue with how well the work was adapted, because here it seems just the concept itself is plainly quite daft. Overambitious to the point of being painfully unrefined and uninteresting. The entire series feels like it struggles so mightily to explain the concepts that the story just isn't interesting anymore, and none of the blatantly contrived dramatic mechanisms fit in a way that engages the viewer. This is like sitting at the dinner table and listening to your 14 year old nerd cousin rattle off his latest role-playing game campaign idea he plagiarized from a video-game he'd been playing, cringing and begging for it to end. If you're going to write a sci-fi that needs to be a saga because it takes place over the span of 400+ years, then you need to do it with a lot more craft than this, because this series is going nowhere fast. The idea itself is lackluster. Someone aims a satellite at the Sun, which supposedly amplifies its signal to an extraterrestial race 4 lightyears away in a 3 star system, presumably Alpha Centauri, since it is the only documented system which fits this description within 4 lightyears distance. They make contact with an alien species called the San-Ti, who apparently have faced many extinction events on their own homeworld over the span of millions of years and have thereby come into possession of technology so advanced it allows them to communicate at sub-light speed, going so far as to project whatever images they want onto humans, able to make supercomputers the size of protons that propel themselves faster than light and that grow large enough to encircle the entire Earth and block out the sky, and supposedly, despite many great cataclysms (which apparently weren't so cataclysmic since they went on and on...) were able to build an entire interstellar fleet that can travel at 1% the speed of light all the way to Earth. All this to say that in about 440 years after first contact, 400 years known publicly by the masses of humanity, some aliens would be arriving to conquer the Earth. Ok. That's some ground to cover in ABSOLUTE BOREDOM. This means the only projected excitement until then is that we watch humans dig a really big figurative trench? No idea where they're going with this, but season 1 was utterly a forgettable SNOREFEST. Add some very tenous physics into the mix, in the form of humans lining up a chain of nuclear warheads in space to propel a solar sail (bro... all that would do is melt the solar sail and obliterate the probe, use your freakin' brain...), or making a supercomputer by having a million soldiers hold some picket signs and flip them back and forth, possibly utterly at random, to come up with some exact, obscur calculation (literally as if the only function of this was for the visual impact of seeing a million dudes fliping binary-colored picket signs en masse, since the concept is clearly nonsensical in the extreme...). Introducing a dramatic mechanism in the form of a forlorn lover stricken by terminal illness who heroicly offers his living brain for experimentation. Trying to make the entire plot mysterious by burying it under 40-odd years of an omniscient secret society that can make itself invisile to cameras, and knows everything whenever it is deemed it would make the plot more interesting, but is utterly oblivious whenever it is deemed that there WOULD BE NO PLOT IF THEY KNEW EVERYTHING?... The entire thing reeks of amateurism. This seems to likely have originated from a book that fringe sci-fi readers have tried to forcefully hype, rather than a work that has gained momentum on the merit of its originality or genius. I might tune in for a second season just out of the sheer hope that it miraculously all comes together in some way that makes having invested all this time in such a disappointing first season worthwhile, but so far, this is NOT The Expanse. Not remotely. It's not even Star Trek The Next Generation, or even Bablyon 5, quite frankly. Doubt this would have been hyped if it were the product of a western mind, moreover since so much like it has already been written by western authors. I REALLY strongly feel that being of Chinese origin is the ONLY thing this story has going for it. All the more power to you if that's your thing, but honestly, I don't think ""exoticism"" really applies to writing, particularly of the sci-fi or fantasy varieties, which really should always be cultureless in essence to begin with.A trio of Game of Thrones actors to see here, if that's your thing, but the real talk of the town is Eiza Gonzalez. Again, WHAT an UTTERLY EXQUISITE MOUTH on the young woman. Just a gorgeous creature, and one of the more interesting and engaging actors herein.Again, I will glady eat my words and feel like my screentime has been refunded if this somehow shapes into anything actually interesting and original in future seasons, but so far all it has done is to make me lose interest in the books altogether, on the assumption that they're anything like what is being presented here.I'll give it 3 stars out of 10, one to represent each of the bodies in the ""3 Body Problem"", so we can call it the ""3 Star Problem"", to be nice and gimmicky like most of this story's plot devices..."
2	Brilliant show, can't wait for more of it! True to the game series in terms of its story telling, character choices and humour! Like any long term fan I was concerned and skeptical it won't be as good as you hope but it certainly did not disappoint, really looking forward to how they expand on the world they have created in future seasons also looking forward to seeing how the characters develop over time and the introduction of more lore and easter eggs from the various game titles, no spoilers in this review want to say if you are a fan of the franchise you should absolutely watch this show! Highly recommended!
2	3 episodes and hold on simply because I had nothing to do. The dialogue seemed very short from reality. Characters seem disconnected, but the TV show as a whole, had an intriguing truth behind it. The plot seemed funny so stayed.Then the plot turned out to be secondary and I found a true rarity nowadays. The script is implacable and everything started to make sense.It has a bigger plot than a stalker woman who was already a huge plot to be explored. The main character has so many layers that you just start to understand them by episode 4.And let's not forget the homage to PTA and the perfect Magnolia. That was beyond magnificent. Aimee's cover, the sequences, and the shocking images all in all give us the true that we didn't want to see cause we were so focused on what we believed was the main goal of the TV show. And that's life as well.You won't find Hollywood techniques here. It's just a smart and ironic development. Like life.
0	"Never in my life have I seen a worse show. The characters are shallow, have panic attacks literally ever 30 seconds, ignore actual patients and worry about each other, and the whole thing seems completely unrealistic. I wish Ellen Pompeo would stop with the George Bush impersonation and actually open her eyes. Just a terrible show. A better title would be ""girl doctors who complain about their sex lives and pretty much whore around the whole time"". If you want to see a near-perfect medical show, then hit up FOX on Tuesday nights to see a doctor at his finest: Hugh Laurie as Dr. Gregory House. Laurie's character, a pain-killer addicted M.D. with no regard for manners but a genius doctor, brings sheer brilliance to the screen, making the show unbelievably intense and suspenseful, yet manages to be completely realistic, and he ACTUALLY DEALS WITH HIS PATIENTS, rather than sleep with his co-workers. Grey's is just extremely sub-par, and fails to attract any demographic other than females who've had ""every kind of boyfriend."" In other words, ditch Grey's, watch House. Period."
1	Watched the series over 3 days. I haven't read the books, but because I was confused by the plotting and lack of exposition, I had to read the Wiki entry to flesh out the plot. Production values were good and some of the set pieces were visually impressive. The characters were cliched and all huffy urgency and faux anger. Acting was ok. Luam Cunningham chewed a lot of scenes. Perhaps it lost something in transposing the novels from the original Chinese setting. By the end I didn't care about what was going to happen in the next episode, let alone centuries from now. I wanted to like it enough to see a second series but nah, I think I'll let it go.
2	Well well well... For all those hoping this to be another fantasy show, hey folks! It's nothing like that. Once you begin watching this you'll grow a certain affinity towards the characters as they build themselves up. And mind you, GOT is an emotion. The storyline has dark tales and brutal twists up its sleeve. And especially the theme song🎶 WOW. So if by any chance you are missing this, then pal go for it NOW!
0	"Do any of you people watch TV? The world building in this show is very poor and a far cry from what I'd expect from these writers. The characters in this show are boring and pointless, you could take out the stoner black guy and the wet paper bag dying guy and the series wouldn't lose anything.What annoys me the most is the sky blinking in the first episode, and the series acts like only the stoner black dude knows how to read morse code in the whole world. If this was actually real, millions of people would share the numbers around rhe world and governments, scientist, and civilians, even religions would be based around these numbers and chaos would ensue. But no, nothing, the whole world just accepts this universe was blinking and life goes on as normal everyone goes to the pub and no impact on life whatsoever, and the best explanation the ""genius"" black stoner guy can give is ""oh it's a deepfake"". Give me a break!This show is for kids, people who do not watch TV, and are impressed by simple things, this show is filled with cringe and unbelievability. Then again lots of people are easily impressed."
0	Season 1 and 2 were good, it was entertaining and different from the usual cop shows as it was about an old rookie. Season 3 took a huge plunge! Way too woke. It's no longer entertaining just exhausting.
0	Netflix insisting on funding projects helmed by indulgent, entitled amateurs verses artists. The GoT boys trying their best. This is what happens when the ego takes over those who, are at their best, periodically lucky.I can't help but laugh as I type - Eiza González as a scientist and boss of a particle accelerator? Who wouldn't believe that? What a pitiful casting choice. And if the casting is that absurd, how do they expect us to buy into anything else? After the first episode, I decided to discontinue watching and switch to the book, which I've been told far outshines this unfortunate exercise.
0	"The cast: unattractive men, a strong independent woman who deals with raiders at level 0, and a couple of veterans like Kyle MacLachlan and Michael Emerson.There is no chemistry between the characters. Everyone who could've carried this piece of art appears for 5 minutes at most. A vault dweller sees the ocean for the first time and shows zero emotions with the phrase ""Okey-Dokey."" Stanislavski gives a standing ovation.Absolutely everyone wears clean clothes in any situation. The locations and props are either restored from the video games without imagination, or are similar to modern times, except that they painted burning debris here and there.10% clowning, 60% fan service and 30% fixation on sex. The series leaves you with the feeling that the script was written by a teenager with sperm toxicity who overplayed Fallout 3."
0	This show started out as my favorite police show. The she was entertaining. Season two comes along and it start being over the top. How many major crimes (nuke threat, multiple bombs, serial killers, etc. ) do do three rookies face in a year. It reminds me on how over the top Grey's Anatomy became. This leads me to season 3. Season 3 is just plain terrible. The show could not get more preschy. It becomes a Leftists wet dream. Every episode was worse than the last. We never made to season 4, but from what I've read we didn't miss anything. This was a real shame as my family really enjoyed the show.
0	"I'm a physician. Are doctors just as human and fallible as everybody else? Without a doubt. Can they have troubled, messy, disorderly personal lives? Absolutely. Can they act irrationally and make mistakes? You bet. Do they experience uncertainty, fear, anxiety and insecurity? Yes indeed. Does that mean ""Grey's Anatomy"" is true to life? No way.Not a MOMENT of this piece of Hollywood claptrap---either medical moments or personal moments---rings true. Surgical interns sleeping with attendings on the night before their first day on the job? Residents sleeping on gurneys in the hallway? Where are the call rooms? ATTENDINGS ARE SLEEPING IN THEM? ATTENDINGS SLEEP AT HOME!!! Surgeons taking care of seizure patients! When he gets into trouble, the ATTENDING ASKS INTERNS FOR HELP INSTEAD OF CALLING A NEUROLOGY CONSULT? Attending surgeons SHAVING THE SCALPS OF SURGICAL PATIENTS which is what nurses are paid to do? Interns talking to attendings in a way that INTERNS NEVER DO! Attendings ordering interns off cases in front of other interns? IT NEVER HAPPENS! A patients who was discharged a month ago and is still in the hospital and who SINGS to get people to do what she wants? Get real.There is a strict pecking order in medical training; whatever level you're at in the hierarchy, you live in terror of everyone above you. You speak when spoken to and you try not to look like an idiot. While these shows may attempt to show you what modern medicine LOOKS like, the resemblance to actual medical experience ends there.You want fantasy? Ditch ""Grey's Anatomy"" and watch ""Scrubs."" It's a comedy, and if you want realistic medical practice, you won't find it here. Nevertheless, although ""Scrubs"" makes no pretense of objective realism, I watch it and enjoy it. Why? Because ""Scrubs"", better than any of the other shows I've seen recently, and certainly a LOT better than ""Grey's Anatomy,"" actually manages to capture the inner life of medical residents by externalizing not the REALITY, but the SURreality you so often encounter or feel in the process of postgraduate medical education."
2	"As a huge fan of the original I was skeptical of this series ""remake"". I was extremely surprised to find Ripley to be a refreshing new take on the original movie. The cinematography was exceptional! The fact it was filmed completely in black and white threw me at first, but soon I felt it was meant to be that way.I found myself hooked immediately, and had to watch from beginning to end in one go.No one can beat Matt Damon's performance in the original in my humble opinion, however this new take was a very close second. Bravo! Every performance was well cast with one exception.I could have easily given this version 10 stars, but, I am sorry to say, the characterization of Freddie Miles didn't work for me at all."
2	I had to give up rating TV dramas based on realism some time ago, as they have no basis in reality. The Rookie is quite entertaining as long as you suspend some beliefs. Nearly every show has a gunfight where the perps have automatic weapons and the cops have Berettas. None of the good guys get hit despite hiding behind a wooden box or the door of their cruiser, but they still hit the bad guys. Starting from that lowered standard, the characters are funny, likeable, and the plot lines entertaining. Season 3 started to dabble in social justice issues, but the writers tied it into a bad cop storyline and wrapped it up quickly. I like Nathan Fillion so I am a bit biased, but the show would work even without him.
1	"What's with the silly characters and ""humour""? Not funny, not engaging and definitely nothing to do with rookies any more really. How can something so good go so bad? Have you changed writers? Please go back to the old ones, it's cringeworthy and embarrassing and I'm surprised the actors agree to day those lines and get involved in those plots.What's with the silly characters and ""humour""?

0	Whenever Debbie Allen is heavily involved, the show isn't worth watching. Has gone down markedly over the last few seasons, needs to be put out of it's misery.
0	The beginning of this show is good, then it gets okay, and then it gets so, so, bad. Like, painful to watch bad. But when you've invested like 15 seasons into it, you don't just wanna quit. So best not to start at all.
2	From the trailers I was like man...idk if I'm gonna like this. Especially with how video game adaptations have gone in the past. But this show IMHO overall is an 8. Some episodes are a 6/10 but I think when you add up all of the storylines and the lore. It's fantastic and an absolute blast. You really start to relate to all of the main leads and see their character development throughout. Especially found myself interested in Norm and the vault storyline. It became super creepy and tense and my only wish is that that had more of a payoff.This is coming from someone who started with New Vegas, then fallout 3 and Fallout 4. This show was awesome.
1	I really enjoyed the first 2 seasons of the rookie. An enjoyable show about an ageing rookie and his younger counterparts, who are coming to terms with being on real life patrol in LA and learning lessons daily. OK, it could be abit cringe at times but overall a fun show. Then, around season 3 it starts to fall off a cliff. Once it hits season 4 it's just insane. Apparently in LA there's no detectives as the patrol officers just decide to solve every case on their own. From murders to terrorism to going into another country to free a kidnapped colleague. They just do everything themselves. There is no protocol apparently. Nolan, the main protagonist of the show was a likeable character but hes too much by season 4. Mr moral highground. I still watch the show but mainly to laugh at how incredibley stupid its become.
1	"I don't write many reviews, and honestly have little to say about this other than to express my wonder at why they would choose to make a ""Shogun"" of this caliber, and then jettison the essence of story itself? This is entertaining, and well made, the acting quite sound...but it is not Shogun. And this is not the usual trimming of events and characters that must accompany moving from the superior storytelling medium of books to film - this is changing characters completely, altering their motivations, the ""whys"" behind the ""whats."" Characters bear no resemblance to their written counterparts, and with their very character and motivations recast, the story loses its purpose and sense - it is an entirely different tale and lesson. And I can only wonder why, and marvel at what sort of hubristic arrogance leads these film makers and adaptive writers to do things like this. Do they really think they're a better story tellers than Clavell? It's just kind of sad to me."
2	My guess is Grey's Anatomy is the best medical drama after House. It's the perfect mix of serious and funny. Last year,I came to home and I opened the TV while I was eating my cornflakes. I saw this series. I have been watcing it since that time. I still remember the first scene that I watched of the show was Derek telling Addison in 212 at Christmas time that Meredith's wasn't revenge, he fell in love with her. I would love to listen this show's soundtracks, I enjoy the new music and artists. My favorite actor was Sloan. I wish I had not died. Now,my favorite is Jo. She is success. I hope she does not die! For anyone who loves medical shows, drama and romance, this show is for you. And most of the time, the medical parts aren't the big part of the show.
0	I loved this show watched it twice until about season 14 i suppose slowly the seasons have deteriorated and honestly i was kind of looking forward to season 18 and 19 but really its POOP. What on earth has happened to it? The characters are lack lustre, boring, Meredith has lost her passion, the show has lost its passion.I dont think i will even both to complete season 19. The residents are just DULLSVILLE. The same characters recycled to death. STORY LINES errr what story lines. SEX EDUCATION BY VIDEO i almost fell asleep.NO MORE let meredith and crew go off in the sunset and all live happily ever in lah lah land. Cos this show has sure as hell jumped the shark. Grey's Anatomy 2005-2023 R. I. P.
0	"Disrespectful and disappointing!John Blackthorne and all of his translators speak English in this show! Even though they refer to it as Portuguese, which has caused some confusion.With so many great portuguese actors available.. As a portuguese guy that loves history I found this cringe and OUTRAGES. This director should be sues and stopped from doing more historical movies."" Portuguese was among the world's key languages in the 15th and 16th centuries, serving as the lingua franca in several regions, including in African and Asian countries. Portugal was ahead of all European countries when it came to maritime imperialism in the early 16th century, establishing commercial routes and colonies in North Africa, West Africa, South Africa, and the region that would become known as Brazil. The Portuguese arrived in Japan in 1543, and by the end of the century, both the Portuguese language and the Christian religion had been assimilated by many Japanese."""
0	A good shut-off-your-brain show that I found relatively enjoyable for a while...Filled with the standard Left Coast diversity, inclusion, equity, and on and on...I realize the writers have certain beliefs that they hold, but in a floundering industry, holding your views to be that of the audience can be dangerous...As a gun owner (radical right-wing gun nut, as the writers, would call me), I could forgive the lax safety portrayed by the actors...But an episode that bashes a private citizen carrying a firearm is a bridge too far...First off, try to get a concealed license in LA...Second, if you are privileged to carry in LA, I am sure that carrying in a bank is illegal...Poor writing by the uninformed...Know your audience...It is no longer me.
2	"The series is visually stunning. The choice to shoot monochromatic in no way detracts from the location as some have stated, but instead greatly enhances and celebrates the landscapes and architecture of Italy. ""Black and White"" focuses on the detail rather than the color, highlighting every crease, corner, crack, and crevice like color photography never can. An equally important benefit is the fact the stream isn't burdened with chrominance, only luminance, and the reduced need for compression is on full display. I've never seen another streaming presentation that looks like Ripley.The writing is also exceptional, weaving an intricate yet comfortably engaging path for Ripley and those with whom he interacts. He's good yet flawed, evading detection as much via happenstance as skill. Even mundane details are well considered and presented, adding a level of verisimilitude rarely seen in modern storytelling.The entire cast is on point, with Andrew Scott's layered portrayal of Ripley's sociopathic neurosis leading the charge. The effortless manner in which he transitions between charming and disturbing is delightfully unsettling, yet the writing and direction are so skilled we find ourselves rooting for Ripley to succeed. In that sense it's an eight episode homage to the tension Hitchcock masterfully crafted in the scene in Psycho in which Norman awkwardly disposes of Marion Crane's car."
1	I have genuinely enjoyed this show and would rate the first two seasons at a solid 8. The plot and characters have been interesting and enjoyable overall.Season three, only a few episodes in, is a huge disappointment. Does every tv show and movie have to bend the knee to the so-called 'woke' agenda and relentlessly bombard its audience with political messaging? I can watch CNN for that.Come on, Hollywood, I want to be entertained, not indoctrinated. I'm sure you can come up with a more original storyline for this season.For this year, at least, I'm out.
2	This series started off strong but the writers of season 3 seems to want shove every PC issue into every episode. There's just too much baggage to make you care about any of it.
0	So a series is flushed down the drain. I liked Rookie. Likeable actors, funny, gave a basic positive feeling about the police. There were also in the first seasons, signs of BLM, identity politics and zeitgeist. But it was still ok. Well implemented in parts. Now it's just diversity, police violence. Don't need it. Sillen they earn grld with their minorities or go broke.
0	The only thing 'captivating' about this true story is the fact that despite being given virtually every conceivable reason (other than actual physical violence) not to encourage Martha's mad behaviour, Donny can't seem to just tell her to piss off. Perhaps he doesn't need to say it in as many words but let's be reasonable here - just say no thank you.He cracks a sexually suggestive joke after she's showed up at his work every day for weeks and proven herself to be a delusional, compulsive liar.He goes to a cafe with her for lunch 'as friends' after she's made it painfully obvious that she thinks they're much more. Again, this woman is clearly mad but he still takes her to lunch.He has a cute moment on the bench outside his comedy club with her where he actually joins her in singing a romantic song. I don't care that he changed the words - that is moronic under the circumstances.She comes to his house under a false name and then sits at a bus stop across the road after he asks her not to sleep over. Instead of calling the police or ignoring her, he finally goes outside and WIPES HER NOSE WITH A TISSUE.Then he takes her home and has a nice fake breakup with her.All this while she's writing him hundreds of e-mails a day and clicking through/commenting on every piece of his social media.This is either the stupidest man on the planet or the stupidest plot of the decade or, like a sort of reverse-miracle, both. Whatever it is, it's maximal sub-par dredge dressed up as a 'modern emotional' thriller / drama / I'm sorry for everyone involved somehow. Watch Ripley instead. If you've seen Ripley, watch it again instead.
2	"This series is just fabulous. Drama, Comedy, Romance... it has a little bit of everything.Sometimes you laugh, sometimes you cry, sometimes you smile, sometimes you get angry. You get a thousand emotions by watching this.Each episode makes you think and reflect about lot of things.Maybe in the beginning when you start to watch you may compare to ER or something but it has nothing to do with it, it's so much better.The series is really vicious once you begin to watch more than one episode, and begin to start ""envolving"" yourself with the characters, and knowing the characters. This series will become your vicious :)"
0	Idk where this show is going. But it sure seems a lot like this Old Left Behind Show i watched years ago. Bunch of people killing themselves, and its super boring. THis is so very slow and so very boring. And the way its shot and the way the story is being told, I dont know how anyone could grow to care about any of these characters.So science is evolving in unpredictable ways. We have theories today that could explain such a thing..but nope, everyone just starts killing themselves because they are too rigid to open their minds up to new possibilites.It also kinda reminds me of this show where THe main character was arguing about God is Nowhere and God is now here. An interesting concept that goes nowhere.How could universe altering physics be tied to a chinese revoultion 50 years ago. It does not seem like it will get any better.
1	This show starts off as a great look at what it's like being a rookie on the streets. It was a well thought out script going through everyday situations, and dealing with police & public relations. Sadly it has morphed into another shoot-em-up cop show where there is a gun fight in every episode and people are getting shot left and right. It's a common trap that police shows fall into, and it is more a sign of lazy writing and unimaginative conflict resolution on the part of the writers. We don't need to have a massive crisis every episode to keep the show interesting, but thats whats happening. It is sad to see a show that had such a promising start fall squarely in the trap of needing to have a shootout so often that the whole show becomes completely unbelievable.
0	What did I just just see.... The dragons' scene is unnecessary
2	"I mean it, this is by far the best video game adaptation ever. It's actually still very hard to believe that it's as good as it is. It's in my opinion far superior to the overhyped, critically acclaimed TLOU adaptation by HBO (see my review of that show for why).Our main characters 1. Lucy MacLean: Ella Purnell is an absolute treat, her acting is fantastic and her giant eyes and soft voice fit perfectly with the character she's playing. She looks like a vault-tec bobble head turned into the cutest girl in the best possible way. She's not the stereotypical Disney strong woman trope that everyone is sick and tired off. Instead she is still incredible capable and combat trained but also very femine at the same time. Generally she's not unrealistically strong in combat. She's not throwing around men twice her size with ease, but she can defend herself, is a very good shot and uses her wit, charm and also her ""lawful good"" personality to survive. Strangely, everyone but Maximus seems to ignore her good looks in the wasteland. When I imagine it's rare to see someone that pretty. It's a breath of fresh air to see a woman as the protagonist be feminine in a show again.2. The Ghoul AKA Cooper Howard: Mr Goggins delivers absolute gold as always. The ghoul is a relentlessly brutal character who has at the start lost most of his humanity. We later learn his drive to live comes from the fact that he's looking for his family. The acting is incredible as always. The makeup and cgi for his ghoul version look great (maybe a little smooth). Cooper has no chill, he's not just quick to defend himself. But also to kill innocents with no remorse. 200 years in the savage wastelands have turned him into something that isn't a monster but has little humanity left. No sympathy for anyone and a singular drive. To the point where he eats former friends for substanance, kills those offering him a job. And even after Lucy shows him a kindness, ""her golden rule"" (treat others as you'd want to be treated) and saves him after he tries to sell her to organ harvesters, tortures her and even cuts her finger off. He murders a young boy in cold blood infront of his father and child sister, after he taunts him about having murdered his older brother earlier. Goating the kid into pulling a rifle. When in reality, a rifle bullet seems to literally do nothing to Cooper. Which is kind of a problem, Ghouls in the show have rapid healing abilities and Cooper esp seems to be indistructable. But the rules aren't clear.3. Maximus: Aaron Moten's Maximus is probably the weakest link. Mainly because his acting feels so inconsistent and at first I couldn't put my finger on it. It's like he's cycling through emotions or facial expressions constantly and it's very distracting. In more emotional scenes this kinda looks unhinged. For example, the interrogation scene he looks like he's about to snap, to a point that I thought it was the point. That he was going to snap and turn into some brotherhood zealot radical and an antagonist. Use everyone around him as a ladder to reach his goals. Instead he's an insecure guy looking for a place to belong and looking to be a hero. To save people. Which is fine. Great even. But his acting just never felt right. And I think I get why that is after having seen some interviews with him. He's very, very feminine in his mannerisms and facial expressions in real life. And in the show his character is trying to act a lot more masculine and straight. But his true self keeps breaking through his acting, the behavior I confused for cycling through emotions was him making his natural facial emotions but then changing them to fit his role more, but not always being able to keep the face straight. He will constantly slightly protrude his upper or lower lip and have this weird stare in certain scenes. One of the worst examples and also one of the worst scenes in the whole show is the scene where Lucy offers to sleep with him. And I think he's supposed to look shocked, a little scared and shy. But instead he comes off like he's a little girl, weirdly pouts his lips and pulls his shoulders together etc. And the dialogue being ridicilously infantile doesn't help ""with some guys their penis grows and explodes like a pimple"" or something. What? He's an adult man. He lives in barracks with men, women, trans people etc In fact in one scene a guy is clearly mastrubating under the covers. There is NO way in hell a man wrote that line. In fact, right after writing that I checked the writer for the episode. And it's a lady called Karey Dornetto. They really need to stop this nonsense where they have every episode written by a different writer. It makes the show/story feel super inconsistent.The writing It's really good at many parts.. For example a lot of the comedic bits and humor were great. Some of the lines are fantastic. But it's also horrifically bad at other times. And I mean beyond how weird it is that Lucy would casually asks Maximus to sleep with her in a room with a giant window, in a strange place, surrounded by strange people. I thought it was funny she was asking about sperm count etc in the vault. But that made sense. Just randomly inviting people to have sex with no protection etc in that weird condition? Was that supposed to be empowering or something? Or just a set up for the pimple penis joke or Maximus later asking if she'd like to ""explode his D now."" Beyond all that, the motivations for NONE of the antagonists make any sense1. The corporations: Vault-tec wants to wipe out all the competition, on a larger scale. Wipe out literaly every faction, country, group, political entity and organization so there won't be anyone to fight or compete anymore. Total domination by one group, one faction: Vault-Tec. How? By a nuclear holocaust. By dropping the bombs themselves. But that's just part of the plan. They know it won't wipe out everyone. Their plan is to, wait for it..... Wait it out.. their plan is that everyone on the surface eventually dies. How? Time. But .. that makes no sense? They'd multiply and start rebuilding naturally, right? Nope.. don't think about it. ""The greatest weapon of mass destruction is time"" according to vault-tec in this show. But it gets better. Vault-Tec then invites all their competitors.. to join in on the fun. Because obviously the best way to end competition. Is to tell your competition of your plans an invite them to join you in the new future you're planning to create. But wasn't the point .. that there'd be no more factio- SHHHH, DON'T THINK ABOUT IT! Oh and the vault experiments.. well those are now made up by different corporations for their own end goals, that they are allowed to choose for some reason. In the game lore it's the enclave who was convinced the nuclear war would was inevitable and would make the world uninhabitable, so they planned to create multi generation star ships and colonize different planets. Most of the vaults were meant as experiments to see how people would last in long term confinement and or to create some super human species etc etc and a small amount of them were control groups and thus had no experiments etc going on.Listen, I'm fine with the corpos dropping the bomb, even though it ruins the ambigiouty we had about who dropped them. I don't mind vault tec's somewhat cartoony power hunger and motivations. That's totally fine in fallout. But the bad writing, the plotholes, the inconsistency .. that's unacceptable. These people are supposed to be professional writers, and they couldn't come up with something better? OR just stuck to the game lore? Same for characters, it's ok for them to be whacky and over the top. It's fallout. But there is a limit to what works and what is just infantile and dumb.2. Lucy's parents: So Lucy's dad is a lower level cog in the Vault-Tec machine and he's assigned to live his life out in a vault, herding the flock. All the Vault 31 people are cryopod people from before the bomb. This doesn't seem enough of a revelation for vault 32 to break out into a full on civil war and massacre each other. But that does seem to be the extent of it.Moldaver's talk about Lucy's mom Rose was cringe worthy. Oh, how smart and mary sue she was. She inferred from the vault losing water, that it was being siphoned. She didn't assume it was a leak or anything. No it had to be that civilization had restarted and their water was being siphoned by them. How did they siphon the .. water of a vault? Wouldn't that be a design fla-- don't think about it! You're not supposed to think! Look, I'm not looking for much logic, but, what? And then when she tells her husband, and he says .. probably just a leak. She figures he's must be hiding something? In a vault full of people that are bred to be docile and nice to each other? She has no idea what's there. It might be a leak, it might be a bunch of monsters or raiders, the radiation is still there etc etc. What does she do? She takes her children and .. leaves the vault. She takes her children to an irradiated wasteland to live in an irradiated town among mutants, raiders, murderers, and under constant threat of monsters, other factions, radiation etc It's implied she has a romantic relationship with Moldaver and that Shadysands was this super great, perfect place where civilization had thrived etc. What? I mean sure there was more safety than other places and the NCR was in power etc. But it was still the fallout world with raiders and tons of hostile factions, cannibals, ghouls, monsters, radiation in every part of the world etc.The father than, get this. Goes and takes the children. And then. He NUKES the town. How does a mid level management tool from a corpo nuke a whole town you ask? Don't. Because we're never told. He just does.There is much more, but it appears we've run out of the characer limit. Overall, I really enjoyed the show. But it could have been so much better."
0	"What a shame this turned the way it did, First few episodes this was shaping up to be a half decent series, but sadly the PC cancer thats effecting hollywood has utterly ruined this show. By episode six I was PC'd out, I was so sick of being hit in the face every episode with as much SJW crap as they could cram in to a single episode I was physically hold my head in my hands and saying ""Give it a rest ffs"", just tell a story without feeling the need to make it blatantly obvious you have an agenda.Truely a shame :("
2	After two episodes, this has me hooked. Great production value, good plot with a somewhat historical accurate depiction of the time. Haven't had that much from this perspective and it feels really well made.I kinda get the negative reviews about them not speaking Portuguese at all. It confused me as well at first.But I guess these people cannot think very far: the entire show would be subbed if they did not do that. Because no one spoke English in Japan back then. All they knew was Portuguese and here and there a bit of Spanish. Thanks to the missionaries from both countries.Try marketing a show that is subbed in its entirety to a Western / US audience. Good luck getting that green lit at all.Can't wait to see the rest of the show!
1	The final two seaons completely ruins this show. The first four seasons of brilliantly complex and brutal political drama, are followed by season 5 and 6 where the show still tries but looses it's way a little. In season 7 and 8 it decends into a typical hollywood blend of cliche ridden action film and trivial romance. It doesn't even succeed very well on those two parameters seen in isolation. There is much better action and romance out there. The only reason to carry on watching at this point is to get conclusions on the dense story line and character development one has invested in over the previous 6 seasons. Over its final two seaons, the show however lets down almost every single story arch and becomes entirely plot driven. The characters turn into hollow shells of their former selves and their actions hugely inconsistent. All the decisions they take and everything else that happens is entirely written to drive the plot forward in a rush towards the ending. It leaves you cheated and hungry, yet my score is 6 of 10 based on the brilliance the show was for most of its first two thirds.
1	The past few seasons have gotten progressively worse. The March 26 episode was hopeless. I was already confused by who is pregnant by whom & no longer even care, but the last episode was totally disconnected from the story lines I have been trying to follow. Now it turns out Teddy is also gay? Where the hell did that come from? And Richard & his wife have a good laugh over her buying an entire hospital for revenge...because disrupting lives is so humorous? Meredith still loves her intern...her character is a little old for that. Frankly, I just don't like any of those people.
1	The show is getting so boring. I love this show but this is not the way I want to remember the possibly last season.
2	"I am on episode 4 and am really enjoying this skillful adaptation of Cixin Liu's novel. It's some while since I read the original book so some of the detail is a bit hazy but it doesn't trouble me that the screenwriters have invented several new characters - they are all excellent, especially the scientist played by the mesmerizing Jess Hong.I have watched ""Three Body"", the 30-episode Chinese version of the story and, good though that production was, the Netflix version definitely gets my vote.Cixin's ""Three-Body Problem"" trilogy is brilliant science fiction. Dare we hope Netflix will make TV series of books 2 and 3?"
2	"After reading some of the reviews here, I'm dismayed by the people comparing this version of The Talented Mr. Ripley to ""the original"" 1999 movie-many who panned this version incidentally. The true original version is the 1955 novel by Patricia Highsmith, which I have read, re-read, and highly recommend, and the bar against which every subsequent adaptation should be measured. To its credit, the plot of this version tacks truer to the novel than the 1999 movie, although every adaptation, to include the original 1960 movie adaptation, Plein Soleil (Purple Noon), takes artistic license in putting their own spin on the story. I have enjoyed all 3 film adaptations for their distinctive takes on the original story. Anthony Minghella's 1999 version in glorious color was a visual feast and well acted by Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, and the brilliant Phillip Seymour Hoffman. That version emphasized the class differences and the envy for the kind of Bon vivant lifestyle personified by Dickie and desired by Tom. But this version, in stark, gorgeous black and white, was more psychological, took its time, and reminded me of one of Antonioni's B&W trilogy (L'Avventura, La Notte, & L'Eclisse). The prolonged scenes of Tom trying to dispose of Dickie's body and the dingy reminded me of Coen Brothers' black humor. But it's not quite as good as it could have been. Andrew Scott, as much as I like his acting, which is brilliant (Sherlock), is quite a bit older than Tom Ripley of the novel. Johnny Flynn was kind of an enigma. On the other hand Dakota Fanning as Marge was more like Marge of the novel and perfect. Eliot Sumner as Freddie Miles was a strange choice to say the least. It's not perfect, but the real star of this miniseries is the cinematography, which conveyed both the beauty and coldness of the original story. I didn't want to see a remake of the 1999 movie but rather a unique vision for the original story, and on that level this version succeeded for me."
0	Had huge expectations from David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. Thoroughly disappointed.I work in a start-up where we work with resource crunch, no money, no facilities, literally nothing and we still make decent products, provide good customer service, take feedback and incorporate it and do a good job. What I fail to understand is, how such big companies & production houses with so much money and resources fail to produce something decent.The series with the Chinese elements were really good including the actors. The rest is all crap. Couldn't tolerate other main actors and their acting. There are so many flaws like bad story telling, no depth in the story or characters, bad dialogues, no sci-fi but magic, bad casting, bad acting and not a single moment of thrill except the first scene in China. The list goes on. Instead of wasting time on watching the series, I would have been better-off reading the novel!
2	In the modern age where police officers are either demonised or put on a pedestal, it's good to have a show that doesn't do either. It's a show that presents you with challenges to your perspective and asks serious questions about personal responsibility and the right way to enforce the law and live life in general. I've always been Fillion fan, but this is his best work
2	One of the best series I've ever seen, but the last season was ruined.
1	Really good except for the last episode. The motivation for the corporate types to do what they did is just not realistic. It's silly even. The writers let themselves down with that episode. There's no way a group of corporate leaders would intentionally nuke the world so they can do social experiments in a bunker. It doesn't make any sense at all. It's amazing that this was the best idea they could think of.Good up to that point. Interesting enough to considerActing was good and the main characters likable with good character development throughout.Some nudity in the show that was entirely unnecessary.
1	'Baby Reindeer' is a great mini series that delves into some dark but real life events. It is an incredibly personal story from Richard Gadd's life.A lot of themes within this series are quite unique and not often represented well by other media products. Dissecting the idea of 'the perfect victim' and trauma responses, this mini series effectively represents a much more realistic depiction of sexual abuse and stalking. Furthermore, there is a lot of great LGBTQ+ representation throughout the whole narrative.The lighting is one filmmaking element that captured my attention. It is used to reflect a prominent emotion or action being represented on screen. Also, the use of typing message transitions were very effective. Please check this out if you can handle a heavy story!-Sent from my iPhone.
0	Too bad. You were entertaining. Now you're just too ridiculous and woke. Between the sexual orientation and the over the top storylines, the cheesy dialogue... I'm out. Do better.
0	Grey's Anatomy used to be my favourite show but after Derek died every episode is a struggle to watch. It has become a soap opera all about the personal lives of the characters, it's not a medical drama anymore. Meredith has become flat and the remaining characters are either boring or overly annoying. It would have been a mistake not to mention how much annoying and irrelevant character Maggie is. I have to mute my TV every time she throws a childish tantrum for no reason.
2	Fallout, it seems that things are turning around for video game adaptions. Fallout manages to take the silly, gruesome, complex and chaotic world of the Fallout games and turn it into a compelling tv show. Not a small feat. If anything, the amount of switching in tone this show has it could've gone so much worse.But it's delicate balance of funny, silly, awkward and gruesome is what makes this one of the more unique shows in a while.As a big Fallout fan, especially New Vegas. I had set a low bar for this, how are they going to pull off such a massive world, and such a weird one too. Having Jonathan Nolan behind it gave me some hope. And Goggins helps, as always. But still, I gave it a low chance of succes. Behold my surprise when I binged it in a couple days. This is a genuinely good show. But it took some adjusting.Primarily it leans into the silly *much* more, and it's foundation, art direction and tone of voice lies in the Fallout 4 game mainly. Which it a bit more silly than Fallout 3 or NV who in general are a bit more serious, gritty, and more depressing (as worlds).Directing is great so far. I have some bad memories of Westworld action scenes, especially in later seasons, Nolan is not good at that because it was always a hilarious bullet fest that stood in awkward contrast to the rest of the show. But in Fallout, first off, the firefights and action scenes are perfectly good, and the bit of silliness that they have works because of the universe it is set in.And that takes me to the bit that I needed to adjust to. This is by all aspect, a video game tv show, and it plays by video game RULES. As in it has a lot more comically unrealistic scenes. Whilst both being exceptionally gruesome and gore-y. Therefore it might just be the best video game tv show adaption ever. Because it's not trying to be real life, it's not trying to ground it in our realities. It 's creating a fictious world, and fictious rules to align perfectly with the fictitious rules of games and gaming in general. This is what I needed to accept and once I did I was really enjoying it.Music, pretty perfect, the expected scores. Effective when used for sure. The oldies music really lands the show and puts it right inside the Fallout universe. I could sing all of them by heart. The fact it's the actual music you also hear in the games is icing on the cake.The story is a great way to show the diverse and huge world of Fallout, and we've yet touched the surface. So much to explore and this gave a taste of each. It could go on for a good while.Lore-wise minor changes here and there and mostly some creative choices in certain attitudes and portrayals, but it all made sense to me. None of it stuck out to me as betraying the games in terms of how things work. The BoS are a bit less cool than they should, and more incompetent here, but it's only a division of it. Not the entire thing, so it's easy to look past.Also gore, man, they went all in. And I love them for it. Fallout games are gore-y and they don't stray one bit from that. That's what this show is, it's honest to the game, to an extend I've never seen before.The pacing, it moves along fast, and characters do too, (fast travel..). What I didn't love as much was the coincidental nature of it all, it made the world feel very small and compact when everyone seems to meet up around some random corner every odd episode. If anything, that's my complaint so far, is that the world feels somewhat small. And everything around tends to feel like set dressing very quickly.That being said, for now, Season 1. They really delivered a good time, and I can't wait for S2.
0	Last season sucks no logic bad writing no answers building characters for 7 seasons and just end them badly
0	"As an old man, who enjoyed the true story, the book, so much I read-it several times during last decades, and as a man who watched the ORIGINAL series, more than 40 years ago, I was deeply disappointed with the ""new"" version.The acting skills are mediocre at best, miserable for most parts, the director took the liberty to ignore the book and started inventing BS, the music is awful, and overall, I cannot stop comparing Richard Chamberlain and. Toshiro Mifune with the pathetic, crappy ""actors"" in this ""new"" version.Annoying to see so much hype from the young generation, for a mediocre, even miserable remake, who throw the real story to the garbage bin, yet get acclaimed with 9 or even 10 stars of 10... Obvious these peoples never bother to read the book, and for sure, they never watched Richard Chamberlain and Toshiro Mifune version - real actors, unlike the pathetic clowns on this production... CGI effects and ""diversity"" crews will not bring authenticity, nor quality, alone, if it is no talent and no respect for the book who brought this story to the light.I stopped watching after the first episode, so much it hurt my expectations... I will not recommend at all this - the 1980 version is like an old, savvy wine, and this CGI version is like a synthetic , sugar-free, warm can of Coke, who somebody forgot in the sun weeks ago ... ."
0	I used to like the show but it has become so woke and political it's no longer watchable. They don't even try to entertain anymore, they just want to indoctrinate the viewers.
1	"After binge watching all episode, here is my honest review of Season 1 of Fallout.I've heard of the games, but never got around to actually play them, so my review is based with little to no influence from the games.Fallout is a decent and quite captivating series, only let down by some bad main casting choices, except Goggins, and sometimes wtf moments (like that doctor not getting hit by a single bullet from a robot controlled sentry gatling gun) That was outright the dumbest thing I've ever seen on screen.Episodes 1-3 starts off slow and I felt at times I wanted to stop, but I managed through, and the flashback scenes actually help me keep my interest even more mainly because of Cooper's backstory.The series really kicks off from EP04 and I didn't feel like there was any kind of filler moments, which really made the viewing experience much more to the point.I loved Goggins character Cooper, and his backstory is really the drive in Fallout. Actually the only character I cared and rooted for.Lucy on the other hand, was 'meh' at best. Her dialogue delivery felt sooo... ""robotic"". Character was fine, and I like that they didn't make her to much of ""power girl"" and showed her moments of mistakes.Maximus - I just didn't care for. Dude looks dumb founded half the time. His squeaky voice doesn't fit his character at all. And as of character development goes (almost none btw), I wish he developed a bit more to a badass after all he went through, but no. He remained the same all through.Oh yeah - and don't get me started on that non-binary character. I almost turned it off when the pronouns came out, but luckily her screen time is limited and is only in 2 episode.Overall Fallout is a well made series with a intriguing plot and some decent VFX. Of what I know about the games, this honestly might be the one of the best game to screen adaptation I've seen.7/10."
2	"This adaptation is largely faithful to the book, if your definition of faithful is ""major events that happened in the books also happened in this show"". The whole thing is rushed, and there is no time to let the events sink in. The first episode already covers half the first book. The mystery of what's behind the scientists' deaths and the thrill of the main characters uncovering the culprit are missing entirely from the show. The divide between the two branches of the three body organization is completely omitted. And where are the pendulums? The hard science that makes the source material so appealing is also ""less hard"" here. Two episodes in, we've already arrived at the famous ""Do Not Answer"" scene and know it's aliens. Despite having only 8 episodes, episodes 6 and 7 are nonsense fillers and by episode 8 we're already at book 2.I don't mind the screenwriters adapting characters to a more international audience, splitting and combining some main characters so they can interact with each other because you can't really have an inner monologue like in a fiction. But it makes zero sense that ""everybody knows everybody"" or that some early- to mid-thirties are heads of research centers. The epic feeling is gone because the show is made too UK-centric. Different genders and ethnic groups are ""represented"", but somehow they all have a British (Oxford) upbringing. Major world powers including the US, Japan, continental Europe, and Chinese-Chinese (not British Chinese) are not represented at all. This work is supposed to be an epic that spans the globe, and spans centuries. Yet watching the ""Oxford Five""'s relationship issues, it feels like teenage drama instead.While I might sound negative, this work is miles ahead of whatever's crapping out of Disney/Marvel/SW these days. The CGI is fantastic, especially when it comes to visualizing the VR world. The C******* Revolution backstory is meticulously filmed, and the entire Chinese storyline, however short it is, is spoken in Chinese. I am delighted to see Chinese Sci-Fi being adapted for Western audience, hence +1 star for representation. Nonetheless, as with most shows these days though, please hire more competent writers."
1	I feel very conflicted on this series.The first couple of episodes were very gripping and I was intrigued to see what would play out in the rest of the episodes.Martha was an interesting character despite her very serious issues and very well acted, you could believe you could meet someone like her at some point in life. I was curious to see where the dynamic between Donny and Martha was going, but after the 2nd half of the show I feel it lost it's direction and gave very mixed signals on what it was trying to say.Trying to relate to Donny and his nuances of why he let things continue on for as long as he did is a bit tricky. On one hand trauma is very complex and him trying to keep the peace with Martha, even though she was seriously escalating in her behaviours, you could relate they had a fundamental self hate that tied them together and why perhaps they became enthralled as people.But having her assault your partner and not report it? And then the story with the older man? Was it that he really thought he was going to further his career so he continued going to his place or did he hate himself that much that he let himself get assaulted so many times? And then he goes back to his in the last ep to make friends? It's a story of Stockholm syndrome and it doesn't leave a good feeling once finishing the series.If the main actor went through all these events and none of them are dramatised for the story then I do hope he's in long term therapy as this is a story that is not to be promoted for happy viewing.I feel the show is a case of human behaviour and how people are complex on their reasons to why they are the way they are but I don't think I'll be watching this again.
0	As a sci fi fan, I was looking forward to this. I wished I hadn't bothered.Some of the casting leaves a lot to be desired. Some characters are just not believable, especially Auggie.The current trend of making female characters say the F word for absolutely no reason, is prevalent here and London is the only place in the UK that seems to exist in the movie world, as usual.It really does drag most of the time. I found myself tempted to skip an episode or two to find some excitement.I didn't, worried I would miss some crucial detail, but I wished I had.Some of the visuals were good, but overall way to slow and boring for my taste.Each to their own, I guess.
0	Well, the show is great, for the most part.I got to season 13, episode 1, before giving a review.And the series was good until this, this is the most childish behaviour acted by grown ups, in a show where it is completly unnecessary to hav grown ups portray themselfs like this.This could have been an episode from pll. Or some other teen show.Absoulutely dreadfull.So, 4 stars is all i can give it, thats how little it can take to change a view on a show.All in all, this series is absoulutely worth watching, and im hoping the next seasons will contain episodes with higher quality content.
1	I usually wait to post an overall review until a show is fully done, but now I am fully done with the show.I originally had it at a 9 then 8 and now 7 and I'm doing this review now before it keeps going down.I have amazing memories of the show, season 1-11 are absolutely amazing, all of it, it had a fantastic balance between medical mysteries and difficulties in the OR, with a good mix of home drama and relationship issues, season 12-14 were decent with some good episodes but 15 up to now which is 18 are just some of the most horrendous seasons of tv.There is no more shocking patients, even the family drama is just plain ridiculous, I get after 18 seasons ( renewed for a 19th) it's hard to come up with ideas, SO STOP, go out with a bang!!!I have watched a handful of s18 and it's useless, the show now focuses on whole topics, forcing certain agendas at you, for example I think S17 Maggie thought her boyfriend was going to be killed by the police because he was pulled over, what a load of rubbish, this was in the height of police protests but my god, yes there are bad people out there but your painting an entire police force as animals, I really didn't like that. Greys was a place you would go to escape reality, now it's even worse.My greys days are behind me unfortunately, I'd recommend s1-11 they are superb but just stop after that.
0	What is happening with people that now we only have blood, killing, depression and horrors in every single tv show?What is happening with the person who is sitting at home, watching something so dark and depressing, and is like 'wow this is so good, i am going to recommend this show to everyone'.Every show lately is similar - For all mankind, Foundation (that started good and then ruined everything in second season), Baby reindeer, Westworld, Yellowstone... as if people are not satisfied with depression and darkness from real world but they need to have it in their free time too. I just don't understand And i am definitely not a fan of this show even though all the actors are great.
0	"You can hear the director uttering: ""give me smoking with pouty lips, more smoking with pouty lips!"", and it's distracting and somewhat disgusting pushing this ""hidden"" agenda. Is it a ""countdown"" to emphysema, the main character sees?Ironic that smoking probably killed more people in the world than a certain revolution mentioned. With a sponsorship from the weapons industry as well, and you are in for a treat of a karma, dear producers....And the show: Very interesting premise and possibly exiting story, but started to get a light cough and itchy eyes after two episodes. Besides Eiza González' overacting, the casting and acting is very good and engaging."
1	"I love most of the characters on the show, especially the three lead females - Angela, Lucy and Nyla. Sergeant Grey and Jake are also great characters. Nathan Fallon's John character has a very similar sense of humor and charisma as his character on Castle. Luckily, it still works.However, starting with season 3 there's been some issues. Way too much PC punchlines and clear insertion of topics and issues that are completely out of place.Also, since Nolan's character is supposed to be a ""rookie"" - it's odd that he seems to take a leading role in a lot of cases. Not realistic at all. Also, the character of Bailey is completely ridiculous, it bothers me on so many levels. It's like Jenna Dewan wanted to be a ""superwoman"" like character or something. Their relationship is also completely fairytale like. It's annoying. Luckily, the other three relationships on the show are much better and make up for it."
1	Review Update March 2020 It seems this show has found it's home. It still has a tinge of light but has become a more serious cop show. I like it. There is still a lot of focus on character development. It can't match Blue Bloods but it is going in that direction.Original Review: When I heard The Rookie was coming out staring Nathan Fillion I was interested. I like Fillion and would watch anything he stars in. FireFly was a great series. My wife and I watched all episodes of Castle.The first few episodes were a puzzle to me. Was this a comedy? Was it a straight up cop show? Was it a cop soap opera? It just didn't seem to land anywhere for me. But I find each episode gets better and better lately. We find it is often true that new shows get better after several episodes and that seems to be true here as well.I like the whole cast and the character development is at just the right level. The personal lives of the characters don't overwhelm the story lines, yet they are an important factor.I like my cop shows to be depicting honest officers which this show does. We also watch Chicago P.D. but it often crosses the line with cops doing questionable things. We've considered dropping Chicago P.D. from our watch list for that reason.I just watched episode 16 of The Rookie. I would say since about episode 6 or 8 things have gotten more serious and The Rookie is more of a straight-up cop show which I feel has improved the series. But Fillion adds a lot to the attraction of the show.I will continue to watch and expect things to get even better.
0	For brainwashed liberals... I pity the people that watch this garbage.
0	"The acting and writing in this series is baffling.All the younger actors simply can't act. Apart from the Chinese woman (young and older versions), everybody else has no depth whatsoever.The writing is another problem in itself. Who the hell kisses their friends on the forehead to say goodbye? The writing is crazy awful and horrible lines/actions are flying around 90% of the time. They tried to bring drama.. They brought cringe.The ""science"" behind it all is also baffling. A simple distance calculation is made to be the most brilliant thing ever. It's pretty grim how this was dumbed down to an extreme. The ""intelligent"" characters are not impressive or believable.There's no emotion and no science, so really, what's in it? I don't really understand who they made this for. It's not for kids, but it's too ~low IQ~ for adults. Maybe teenagers? The ideas behind it all are great (have just bought the book because of it), but the series was extremely poorly executed.Mediocre at best."
0	Shogun is one of my favourite books, a sweeping saga of intrigue, murder, plots within plots, great characterisation. The 1980s series stayed true to all that and more. This 2024 version is like a mouthful of dead sea fruit - green and lush to look at but hollow and lacking in any real substance where it matters.I'm sure why some important key elements of the plot were changed or omitted. What's the point of taking a great story and reducing it to a shadow of what it should be?The romance between Blackthorn and Mariko lacked any depth or passion - it feels more casual, like a one night stand or two.There's little to no coverage of the manipulative evil that was the Catholic church, most of the Jesuits and their machinations were left out of the series completely. We hardly see any of Blackthorn's crew and their degeneration in a land that should have elevated them.Mariko's sacrifice had no impact because there was no build up nor explanation for it until after she was gone. Why was she buried when she was cremated in the book? In the book she states that she is Christian but samurai first. Oh, yeah, let's twist the narrative to suit our 21st century mindsets.As for the change in plot to indicate that Ochiba changed her mind about supporting Ishido, why? She and the heir die which enables Toranaga to become Shogun.What a pile of rubbish. Honestly, this could have been awesome. Instead it's just a rushed version that absolutely annihilates what could have been a masterpiece.
2	This show is such a comfort to me, been an inspiration too and I love the first 10 seasons so much!...that said, after the 10th season, the show began getting a little repetitive and now we're at the 16th season and I can't stand to watch it at all now, there are only about three of the original cast members remaining in the show and even their storylines are just...tired, and the other characters just dont have this spark in them that makes their plot interesting enough to watch every week. It's sad to see my favorite show in the whole world reach this stage where I can't even get through an episode with all the irrelevant characters and plots crowding up the show, in all honesty, the show should just come to an end before they ruin the charm of the first few seasons too. I rarely write reviews but I feel so strongly about this show and it really bothers me how they've turned it into a complete disaster, I hope they resolve it and put it to an end soon enough, it's run its track for long enough and they can't keep up anymore clearly.
1	It was great until cristina Yang left. I watched a few episodes after she left thinking it's just part of the plot and she will be back soon, so I did a quick google search and found that she left the show for good. I couldn't watch it anymore. It was so bland and lacked the dark humor she provided. 10 stars if cristina stayed.
0	1 threw 4 seasons were great 5 and 6 were good 7 and 8 so bad can't believe HBO could call it game of thrones. Maybe with different writers the whole series would have bine great.
2	Spoilers in last para ...I have a bad habit of reading story plot before watching any media but it takes the fun and surprise out of it. I had only heard about the show through some friends and did not know what it was about, i decided to give it a shot. I had expected a generic space dram but boy was i surprised. I think i enjoyed it better because i didnt know anything about the story line before starting the show, i suggest you do the same. If you like Arrival, Contact, Oblivion and media along this line the n this show is definately for you.Kudos to showrunners for not shying away from the brutal and gore scenes that do advance the storyline perfectly and which were the logocal step a military commander would have taken to save the humanity and for the greater good. I wasnt sure if the boat would go all the way through but it did !
0	This use to be one of my favorite shows, but now every scene is a political statement and it has turned into a mid quality soap opera. Acting is terrible, music is terrible, all of the characters we actually cared about are gone or dead. I'm so sad it turned into this, they should have ended the show before Derek died honestly.
2	Steven Zaillian's episodic 'Ripley' is not for everyone. It is slow. The lack of action, the dialogue's empty spaces .... this particularly the case in the series' first two episodes. Certainly two hours is not required to introduce the story's setup; a seemingly corrupt young man is sent to Europe in order to persuade another - wealthy - young man to return to The States.But with Episode #3 the story takes a dramatic, homicidal, turn. And from that turn it matters little that the pace remains slower than ideal. The stakes, in each ensuing episode, are raised and raised again. The viewer comes to care about the characters (be they villain or victim) and so we wait (patiently if possible) to learn the fate of them in each episode. As situations grow more complex, more perilous, our imaginations take over (at least mine did), and start to create our own story; 'This is what I think is gonna happen / This is who's gonna die'.The cinematography (black and white) is stirring; a perfect match for the piece's dark and foreboding mood. Where Minghella's cinematic version of this story (Jude Law and Matt Damon) was set in a brilliantly colored Venice, Zaillian's version show's us Italy's underside, darker side; a choice so perfect as to astonish. In both Episodes #3 and #5 the camera brings us nose to nose with the action; again a wise choice. The film does not shirk from its desire to leave us gasping for air.Andrew Scott as Tom Ripley is perfectly quirky, nerdy, unlikeable, and snake-like. A brilliant choice. Quite the opposite of Matt Damon's charmer, this Ripley is a student of the never-back-down; no matter how close he is to the edge of failure, his brain erects a path forward.Dakota Fanning as Marge Sherwood, the young woman in distress is, I guess, OK. In fact I didn't like the character, her innocent young writer abroad. There was a too-willingness to 'buy' explanations that made me doubt her intelligence or motives. A sense of superiority, late in the film, that I liked even less. How much of this is a result of her performance rather than script / direction, I cannot say.But worthy of note are Elliot Sumner as Freddie Miles, a sensuous if over-the-top nemissis of Tom Ripley's. Then Maurizio Lombardi as Rome Italy's Inspector Ravini; as funny and fascinating a portrayal of a policeman as you will ever see; particularly his insistence of pronouncing 'Freddie Miles' as 'Freddie MeeLess'. Bokeem Woodbine's appearance in Episodes #1 and #8 adds a frame to the story. His Private Detective is as pitch-perfect a portrayal of a tough but not-as-smart-as-he-seems New Yorker as you can find.Again, Ripley is not everyone's cup o'tea. And if you give up on it, it's not as though it's the greatest loss you'll ever suffer.But nevertheless, a loss it definitely is.
0	I didn't come from reading the novel, and went in blank. And what an absolute garbage this was. It seemed liked the writers bit off more than they can chew. The plot was riddled with loopholes and the story itself wasn't aware what it wanted to portray. The major thing that stuck out to me was that if the aliens were so advanced and had sent two quantum computers to monitor the humans, then why can't they just have taken control of the world leaders instead of supporting the stupid cult. And whose idea was to put in sending 300 atomic bombs in space, are you kidding me?. I just don't understand who approved this screenplay from Netflix. If you are a science fiction fan stay away from this show at all costs. This is beyond pathetic.
1	Honestly I'm looking forward to the second season. But the first season didn't turn out the way I'd hoped. The first episodes were beautiful and exciting. The dark futuristic atmosphere was good. However, towards the end, that atmosphere gave way to an ordinary sci-fi series. In an eight-episode series, we expect the action to pick up towards the sixth episode and peak at seven and eight, but this is not the case at all in this series. The first few episodes are great, but after the fourth episode, the script drops off. Also, I don't understand the unnecessary mystery created in some chapters. (Btw aren't we tired of seeing Jonathan Pryce when it comes to religion or cults?)
0	Season 4 has really let the show down by far! Even the first episode of s4 set the show up to fail dramatically. Should of left it at season 3 when the programme originally got axed.
0	So far, there is no any adaptation exceed the book. The parts of Luoji'class, put the the Quantum to deep space and many other adaptation in animation exceed the book. The part of LuoJi throw tools and tools divide to multiple is so interesting.The reason why it is said to be a long trailer is the same as I thought before, which is caused by pulling the preparation stories of the last two books forward, so that the audience can only watch the head.Each episode is multi-line, such as the eighth episode with walls and stairs. This is different from what was expected at first. I think the single line is clearer.The part of looking at the bug. It's not very burning. The first half of Tencent's version dragged on, drinking crazy, and the second half became more and more burning, and the score was very good.The opening song is very short. I criticized Tencent's opening song for imitating the West before, but I didn't expect Netflix's own song to be unconventional now.The cruelty of the guzheng plan is well reflected. Tencent version is somewhat weak. In this scene, the people on the boat are fleeing, making the protagonists look like villains. I like this kind of values very much.Ye Wenjie, a staunch believer, was counterespionated by Wade with the recording of Evans and the Lord? The taste of 2DB is too low. They adapted it to a worse version. It must be better that Ye Wenjie, who loves human beings spontaneously. This will more complex and three-dimensional. Of course, Ye Wenjie actually changed because of Qijiatun. But it's better than this.The part of you're bugs is okay. Tencent version is more confusing.2DB is really incompetent. Ye Wenjie and Cheng Jin said this? The same counterespionage as Wade? Ye Wenjie has become a big fool! She even need be teached by Cheng jin, a younger generation? Ye Wenjie's position should run through all three books, and she is a great mentor and wise woman. Hmm. This is not as good as the animation. The part of Ye Wenjie was put on trial in the animation, although she played a villain, at least showed wisdom. Ye Wenjie's plot compiled by 2DB actually seems pedantic.Three factions were reduced to one arrival faction. 2DB brain capacity are really small, so they can't understand original ideal of Ye and the ideal of three factions.Ye's smile was so enchanting and evil when she shows up. What a villain.The part of let's not resist quite elegant. But this is because of faith in the Lord. . Kind of like a dynamic cartoon version. However, the characterization of ye Wenjie in dynamic cartoon version also takes a variety of routes, and only Pan Han is the bad guy.Why does 2DB think its adaptation will be better than the original plot? So far, many adaptations are inferior to the original.Why let Yang take the credit? 2DB can't tolerate there are any good people in China? This is the plot of copying Bai Betrayal Ye in an inferior way.Think of it, if there is no original comparison, the impression of the pure villain Ye is still ok. Unfortunately, there is comparison, 2DB still went to a bad way.When I watch the last episode of 7. Finally, it's time for cosmosociology. As a result, the dialogues are very strange. Is it a new clue to defeat the three-body different from book2? Watch season2. In a word, this part is quite satisfactory, the artistic conception of an old and a young talking about wisdom has been made out. But at first Ye said, I know you don't want to see me. Hey, what characterization? This is. Big villain ye.Will did a good job of following Saul's advice according to the numbers. In the book is filled with inner descriptions.In addition, Ye talks wisdom with saul was not arranged in the first episode or the last episode, which was not very good and was not grand enough. Of course, this characterization of Ye Wenjie itself is not grand. Maybe some reporters wrote a film review saying that the character is flat refers to Ye.It's really great to visit Red Coast Base again without deleting it by 2DB. Actually, Ye of this kind characterization doesn't have to visit Red Coast Base again. And It's also best to visit Red Coast Base again in the last episode.Ye Wenjie was silenced? 2DB can't give an ending of die a natural death. Hey. The scene where the woman talks to Ye looks disgusting. Trying to kill me and pretending.I originally said that Tencent version has shortcomings, I hope this version can surpass it. Who knows it's not as good as that. It is said that 2DB can't adapt well without original books. I don't think it will good if there is. Why not follow the book and change it into a plot with poor effect? It is a good thing to speed up the story. But I didn't ask you to change the plot, and it got worse.Moreover, we already know the plot of the story, so it's no fun to watch the same story again. The animation adds a main line, the four episodes of the Sky-ladder, except for the love drama, the science fiction part is quite good.I watched it at twice the speed. Except for all the Ye parts. But Ye parts disappoint me. YeWenJie is soul role of S1, but 2DB adapts badly. Destroy the original classic characters, 2DB must apologize to the people of the whole world.
1	The first four seasons are fantastic a 10/10 but as the show runners stopped adapting the source material and then eventually ran out of it all went downhill. Every season they manage to have better hair, costumes, music and CGI but that is not why people watch. People the show watched for a good story that is not the usual, something fresh.As the seasons go by the respect for the medieval setting starts to disappear, travel is done in an instant and events happen just for the plot no matter how logical they are.In terms of writing: Seasons 1-4 10/10 Season 5 7/10 - the beginning of the dip in quality Season 6 7/10 Season 7 6/10 - respect for the medieval period starts to disappear, locations start to disappear. Season 8 3/10 - written as if it is set in today's period with women being ashamed of being virgins and people proposing while kneeling.
0	I watch this on Hulu, but you can't leave reviews there. New season has continuous Rosiland Dyer storyline-this is especially bloody, violent & ridiculous.Storyline is to grab high marks for the Rookie Feds new show so producers are dragging this line out too long (crossover episode).I have stopped watching Rookie for this reason until the Rosiland character disappears from the storyline. This program used to be good without the extra violence- I like Rookie Feds so far. Maybe this new show will be more interesting. The crossover episode is on Oct 18- I will look at the episode & will shut it off if the Rosiland character isn't killed off permanently.
2	I really enjoy Grey's Anatomy still. I first watched it when I had to pull an all-nighter for school. I bought season one because it was on sale and I just wanted something on in the background. I got completely sucked in and bought season two when it came out. I started watching it on TV at the beginning of season three. For awhile I thought things were going a little downhill. The show lost some steam during the writers' strike, but there were some decent plots in season five. Season six started out strong, kind of mellowed, then ended with the best finale of the lot. I didn't like the first episode of season seven, but every subsequent episode has been better and better. I have fallen in love with the characters, and I still love them. There are a few to many life-threatening disasters directly involving main characters, but it is a TV show. Overall, I would definitely recommend it.
2	I am binge watching the first season and loving it. The characters are wonderfully cast. Also it is fun seeing Nathan in a TV show again.
0	What the heck is that?I think I read a different book series. Where are the characters? Where is the REAL Scifi, with real Physics concepts and philosophical reflexions?A blinking sky? Is this for real?As a reader of the books, I just feel insulted.If Netflix wanted a new Scifi hit, they've should just invented one, not mess with the real deal.I know that an adaptation would never be exactly like the original. This probably was not even their intention.But that show just seens like a generic scifi thriller, with no real deep scifi basis, except for the aliens and pseudo nerds-scientists.They've just assumed people are dumb and will never like or understand root-scifi explanations.A big big disappointment.
0	I can not support a show that is accussed of harassment. There are other shows to watch.
0	I read the books when it first came out. Interesting concept and definitely an interesting read, but not the type of sci-fi novel that I indulge - too much plot devices and not abstract enough to feel the otherworldliness. I compared it to da vinci's code, so I would consider that a compliment.The show's weakness has been well documented. Extremely shallow modern cast and senseless personal stories that feel like I am watching sex and the city (no offense). The story of the young yeh wenji started strong but I have no way believing she grew into the adult yeh wenji who has zero persuasiveness as a cult leader and one of the most influential scientific figure.I think the short of it is I detest Netflix and pretty much all of their shows (unfortunately my brother in law works there so I can't avoid the exposure). Netflix was once decent and was a haven for good filmmakers to prosper. It has diminished itself to AI generated mindlessness.The story of our era.
1	I've never read the books, so rest assured I don't view 3BP as some sort of sacred cow, never to be touched unless to achieve pure perfection. However this series does struggle.My biggest gripe, is the trailers present this show to us as a dazzling, big-budget, mind-bending sci-fi epic. However 95% of the scenes look and feel like they're straight out of a low-quality BBC drama. It's drudging at times, and you do start to feel like you're never going to get the pay-off you deserve at the end.And after 8 episodes, that's pretty much what happens. I'm aware that the original story is complex and will take time to come fruition on screen, which is fine, but you need something along the way to keep you with it. It's sorely lacking in this regard.A cruel yet reasonably accurate summary, would be a group of friends gassing about how clever they are for 8 episodes, interspersed with a few scenes of psychedelic space-guff that never seems to progress anywhere quickly.I've been harsh here, but the premise is intriguing enough for me to watch a second season if it ever comes to pass. However, knowing how ruthless Netflix are in this regard, and how poorly the show has performed on the platform so far, I won't hold my breath for it.
0	I haven't read the book or watched the other versions of the 3 Body Problem. As a new watcher to the story, this show was annoying and strange. I couldn't connect with the characters as they developed.So many good reviews of this show makes me believe I must be taking crazy pills because this is not leaving a good impression to me at all.The special effects are good, the acting is ok, but there is an arrogance to this show that gives it an ora that it's better than it really is.The biggest issue is that it is very unclear what everyone's motivation is. Why are they so invested in what they are doing? What are they afraid of? Are they just all bored??? As a new viewer to the whole story, this is all so unclear and was not enjoyable to follow.
1	It started as a really good show with some very good stories but it's turned into a number neurotic women characters that made them look weak, confused and without values and morals. I did see Meredith finally come to her own but it took a long time but the rest of women represent so much flighty decisions, confusion on who they are and what they care about. I hope that the younger generation don't see these characters as good role models. I liked the stances on some of the social issues and how they applied real humanity empathy but some of went too far and as the seasons went on it was clear it was written by some extreme left wing writers. It's too bad....
1	I haven't read the book, so I'm reviewing this series from a more objective point of view.Production quality is great, special effects are OK.However, acting is mediocre at best and cringe-worthy most of the time. And where did you get that Latino chic who looks like she just got off the Versace's ramp? Silicone lips, fake eye-lashes... and you're telling us she is some kind of Oxford genius? Oh, come on... Have you ever been to Oxford/Cambridge, have you actually seen what kind of people are best scientists, what they look like, how they behave, what they do in free time? I thought so... The Chinese Cultural Revolution part is great: the setting, the story are very touching and the Asian actors are first-class. Ye's story is really interesting. However, the London drama is so boring and the actors can't act a bit... You actually have to pull through 3-4 episodes for the story to take off.There are 3 books, so I guess there will be at least 2 more seasons... please hire better actors and don't ruin it further.
0	Let's just get right to the point, it's a beautifully crafted pile of poop. That's the biggest compliment I can give him.As someone who has read the original many times, this version of the play adaptation is simply disastrous and inexcusable.If the writers don't have a clear sense of their own abilities, please don't try to change the original setting of an arguably great work of sci-fi; your best bet when you don't have that ability to do it better is to stay true to the original.As of now, I've barely made it through the first 4 episodes with a huge amount of discomfort, and that's as far as I can stand it. The jumpy but boring narrative technique, the poor acting, the thin and feeble characterization, and the transformation of all the most exquisite story settings from the original writings into a bad romance drama is simply an insult to the viewers' intelligence.
0	What about green eyes? What about Night King's motive? Did Arya went Braavos just to show up her faceless thing for once or twice? Why building such plots? Why killing Petyr Baelish, so soon when we all knew he was the man who build most Game Pf Thrones plots? There are lots of plots and stories went incomplete. Poor writing.
0	The new challenge, how to screw up a TV shows final reached a new level! :((
2	Yup. You read the title right. The fact that this show is so detached to 3BP is the exact reason why it's a show worth watching.I really do not understand why Three Body Problem was such a great book. It suffered from severe pacing issues and devoted far too much time to irrelevant details. It also suffered from severe plot holes and setting issues, such as how one of the characters broadcasted a radio signal in a way so simple that others should have thought of it beforehand. In addition, the book brought up VR but never explained its significance to the common people (Is RP1 happening worldwide? Who knows?). The book does this with millions of other concepts and fails to elaborate on any of them. There was just too many ideas - too much fat.Why did I rant so much about the book? Because surprisingly, a Netflix adaptation with the traditional Netflix elements solved every one of the issues above. It really tightened the pacing and grappled with the core issues of the book only - nothing else. It preserved what was important and discarded what wasn't. Sometimes, I feel like the netflix/hollywood hate can get over the top, blinding people of truly enjoyable shows.In conclusion, this show improves everything there was on the book and I would recommend this over the trilogy any day. Please ignore the other haters, they're just blinded by the mindless mob hate I mentioned previously. Just go watch it and let it wow you.P. S. For an actual good Sci-fi read I would suggest the Ender Quartet (especially the first two books) as well as Dune.
2	"I am not a video game person. I have no prior knowledge of the video games this is based on. I watched this because I heard there was a similarity between this and The Last id US, which I loved. There is some similiarity in that there is a grim, post-apocalyptic setting and a ""quest"", but it has a very different tone. I love the 1950's ""frozen in time"" infused nature of this one. Walter Goggins is always good and this is no exception. The series is littered with commentary about the attempts to live in a Utopian society, and the failings of mankind. It is part sci-fi, part western, part drama and more. It is interesting, visually terrific. Well scripted. It is well Directed. It is very, very watchable. The acting is great. There are many cameos and famous stars throughout. I liked this a lot. There is a lot of thought provoking social and political commentary throughout."
2	I've just watched on of the most disturbing, thought provoking, sad, funny and brilliant piece of TV drama I have seen in years. However the major thing that's blown my mind is that it's based on a true story.When I started it, I thought it was going to be light hearted afternoon viewing, the first episode is only 30 minutes, and didn't seem too deep.Then it takes a very dark turn covering themes and topics (no spoilers) in such a powerful no punches pulled way it had me crying.The character are honest and the writing kept my glued until I watched every episodes in on go. Leaving me an emotional wreck.A must watch.
0	To make a review short, the first three episodes are 90% science fiction. They are pretty interesting and exciting.After the third episode, the series becomes a soap opera, stretched, primarily dull, not logical, mostly about people's relationships and emotions.By the way, the casting and acting of the actors is terrible.I believed in only Jin Cheng and Thomas Wade acting.I don't want to judge Netflix, but I really don't remember when I have seen some good file/serial on Netflix, for at least 2-3 years. I hope they will not continue to make new episodes based on this original book. At least not in such quality.
2	Loved absolutely loved the first 3 seasons. Ever since officer Juarez joined the cast I have been turned off from the show. How does she make so many mistakes and so emotional and is still on the LAPD Nolan after making a single mistake almost got booted. Juarez and her emotions are just too much. This character is why I will no longer be watching the show. Just watching her is aggravating. With all those instabilities, mental issues, and feelings she shouldn't be a cop. So season 4/5 1 star. The show needs to show more of Aaron Thorsen he started off being around in the show and came with a mysterious background and an interesting family. We don't get to see much of his character development or much of him at all which is frankly disappointing. The show set us up and got us into a character just to stop showing him. In my personal opinion I would like to see more of him and less Juarez.
0	The starting 4 seasons are fantabulasly awsome...season 5 and 6 are good...than it all goes down the drain in the last two seasons. With all the good actors they had, and took 2 years to produce the last season, they provided us the worst season of all time in game of thrones. #disappointed
2	It's just an amazing filming and camera work and musical and script and acting the only down side of it black and white I wish it's colors it's in Italy and beauty surrounded and painting work and spots it would make it more lovely if true colors showed , true beauty and lovely actors Dakota fanning is star , music is sooooo lovely and series keep you going and going episode after episode I wish there is new season of it next year or so we all gonna be waiting for this masterpiece his acting is super good and nailed it in every scenes and all credit for all the cast bravo bravoThanks again for this masterpiece.
1	"Being a fan of the FPS games I was optimistic about the show when I read the game creator was involved. It doesn't disappoint in that regard. It captures the spirit of Fallout quite well, in every aspect. The visuals, the props, the music, the humor, and specially the violence. It really feels like you're watching cutscenes of a new Fallout game. Where it disappoints is on the actual story. The characters are interesting, but the general plot and the arc of each one are completely predictable. What kept my interest were the creative ""show, don't tell"" moments and the funny surprises that happened here and there, rather than the resolution of the plot which I could predict from a mile away. It's not great, but it's a good show and I'm looking forward to season 2."
2	The viewers greatly appreciate that the show's agenda is to show realistically that most cops are good but there is a minority of bad cops - a stark contrast to what politically motivated media would have you believe.Additionally, the exit of actors attempting to make political statements by leaving the show - good riddance and thank you for cleaning up the cast list with your exit.
0	The themes are basically the same as in the book, but I think they made very poor desitions and writing with the characters.They act like children, and are very annoying in general. The only thing keeping you watching is the overall mystery. Not their teen-like issues and concversations.It also feels a little too long. They could have wrapped the novel in 6 episodes and it would have been fine.It feel like they don't respect the audience enough to think that we can handle a mature sci fi series.They basically took an amazing novel, merged it with scooby-doo and called it a day.Sorry for my spelling. English is not my first language.
0	The show started off really well very violent good simple story line. The effects where really good all the sets look well thought of. But then after episode 4 everything changes. If your love the game and you expect to see your favourite creatures you love facing in the game in here, well sadly you'll be disappointed. Despite the game being apocalyptic the world never feels empty, there's always danger around every corner. Here in the show our protagonist's are able to walk around the wasteland freely without barely any danger. That's right folks no super mutants, no mirelocks, no mole miners, no deathclaws, barely any ghouls. The shows just literally feels like it ran out of budget midway through. How can you have a fallout show without these creatures? There's no fan service here, as I watching I was like ok we gonna see some super mutants soon? Umm nope never came. What about the walking robots? Umm nope none of that here either. Well screw you johnathan Nolan who claims to love the games well clearly not.
2	I thought the excellent The Last Of Us was the best onscreen video-game adaptation so far. And it was. Until now. Fallout is similarly well realised with great attention to detail, very well acted by a great cast and a budget to do it justice. Where I give it a slight edge over TLOU is purely down to it being an original story, albeit set within the Fallout world. While TLOU was a brilliantly faithful retelling of the game's story, this had much more tension for viewers not knowing where it was going. I assume this will be renewed for more seasons as this is top quality! A tip of the hat to all involved!
0	There's not much to say about this show other than that the 9/10 review can only be seen as a joke.There are a couple of great episodes, the first two in fact. The show just collapses after that. Nothing really happens. There is no plot. No character development. The dialogues don't lead anywhere or have any purpose. Shogun isn't good as a character drama, or a pseudo-historical epic or even a soap opera.Even from a visual perspective it's dull and grey, and the camera has a weird blur and depth of field that's overdone.When all's said and done this show is just extremely unmemorable and badly made.
0	This is going to sound like a rant because it's FRESH. I just finished watching.The first thing to say is that I hate this show because I know it's based on something good.The are genuinely good ideas here which is what kept me watching to the end of the series, but when it finished I was angry with myself for watching it. Those good parts I mention, I can tell are lifted from something good (I've not done enough research to tell what that is yet although I'm aware there is another version) but the characters involved are all that unlikeable you don't care anyway!You can tell this series is teeing up something much bigger for the next, but I for one won't be watching.
1	This show was so gooooood! First and second season were really so good and real. Something bad happened in the third season and it's almost unwatchable. The story line is important and there is a lot of improvement on clearing black life's matter but it's brought to the front in such a lame way, I feel like I'm watching the public channel. Everything is so expected and there is like no effort to create any interesting backgrounds or a plot. Plus Nolan is becoming so annoying in his politically correct almost fake behavior, it just doesn't really work.This season, if doesn't change soon ( already on episode 6 ) will finish this show. 2 bad.Edit: Gave a shot to season 4 - this has become a bad joke. They might as well just shut down. 2 painful to watch.
1	I would give the show 8 or 9 stars, but after binging 12 seasons I must ask myself the above question. Many themes are presented which affect less than a few percent of he population, but those of us with misophonia (15 to 20%) are constantly being bombarded with characters eating chips and apples or eating with their mouth full. C'mon, Hollywood and Shonda Rhimes, Betsy Beers and Mark Gordon. This really bites (pun intended).
1	Yeah I read the books, and don't care that they altered the story. It's just too dumbed down and characters are trash.Western audiences think of themselves as sofiticated. True, in most cases Hollywood mainstream stylistic and writing do feel superior to everything else out there qualitatively. Here however marketing strategy for mainstream audiences is taking priority over the story.First of all the show could have been waay more Chinease. And that would be FINE. We don't really engage much with that part of the world especially when it comes to movies. It's a Chinease book anyway so why not. The historic and political context is difficult to monouver about and, that's what makes it interesting. With a proper western cinematic style this could have become something admired BOTH in China and in the West. A wasted opportunity.Casting is weak and characters are trash. An instagram model Auggie (aka nerdy scientist) and her friends struggle with morality of difficult choices in the face of an alien invasion. They don't really give any credible position on the subject, all it takes is to remind them (every time) that aliens are coming so...¯\_('')_/¯ I guess the trolley dillema loses a bit of steam if you introduce the existance of the whole humanity forever on one side.Story is dumbed down. In the book we got fluctuations of Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation measured on a scientific aparature. Here we get blinking stars. They think audience is too dumb to get excited about real science. I guess the CMB, for which discovery 2 american scientists recieved Nobel Prize as recently as 2006, is just too boring for the dum-dums. Sarcasm aside, I don't believe so and that's my point. This should have been Oppenheimer level science storytelling and its not even Bill Nye .The Staircase project is about detonating atomic bomb just behind the sail in vicinity of the probe and attachment cables. Nice.Auggie is coming up with brilliant production-ready applications of the recently discovered nano-fibers but we barely see her solving science problems. She drinks a lot tho, not for a second ceasing to look hot af btw.There is this one time ETO tries to recruit couple of friends and then kill the one who refuses. They still expect other friend to be generally cool with it because it's the Lords plan lol.There is whole plot about dying dude who couldn't move on from the girl he secretly loves. Skip this one is just boring.Good things: Da Shi just as good as in the book.Retrospection scenes with Ye Wendje.Sophon, visualisation of it's deployment.The human computer scene (in the game).Panama Channel scene is fine.
1	Up until Season-7, I've been really really enjoying the show. The stories were interesting and so were the medical cases. I learnt quite a few medical terms because of this show and that was a big added advantage. But, Season-8 onwards, really felt that the show went more inclined towards the characters' stories and less towards the medical cases and the thing that really put me off was the pace at which they were killing and making important characters exit from the show. After that, I left it in between. It feels that they should stop stretching it like a stretchy-band and end the show before more people downgrade the show's rating.
0	"This was a pretty good show initially. As many other reviewers said, seasons 1 and 2 were very good. There was a lot of story and depth with the characters....even characters you didn't really care for, you understood and saw value. The premise of the show was clear and unmolested. The cast was diverse and true to the geographical location the show is portrayed in (LA). There was a lot of ""ahhhh, now I get it"" moments with the characters. It was truly a joy to partake in.There were annoying gripes I typically have of these types of shows, but they were not as egregious as other shows. Magic guns that never run out of ammo, impossible conflicts where the hero wins, etc...those aren't quite as bad as with other shows. However, one gripe of mine is the bias shown for or against certain issues. For sake of not revealing spoilers, there is one episode where something which is perfectly legal was insinuated as not being legal...as there was a claim made someone was transporting something to the police. This kind of false statement shows a bias that ought not exist in this type of writing.Which leads me to season 3. We made it about halfway through it before we just stopped. It's nauseating. This particular trend in shows/movies needs to end. Every episode in the season was some kind of finger wag towards the main character because of his skin color and/or gender. Or, some kind of insinuation or outright claim about some kind of 'ism. It's a show about a middle aged construction worker who decides to become a cop in LA and is a trouble magnet, but has a knack for connecting with people and doing real police work. Don't get me wrong, there is a place for this type of issue...and it was handled pretty good in the earlier seasons when it came up....but this is just too far.Unfortunately we can't go back in time and fix season 3. I don't know if we will give the show another chance. It's a shame too because we really like the cast, characters, and the writing from seasons 1 and 2."
1	So I've watched the first two episodes and it's pretty good. Lots of interesting stuff is happening and the story is building nicely.There is decent acting, lots of plotting (GOTesq) and I'm sure I will watch the whole series.BUT... what is going on with the sets/location? I know they are not real, it's 17th century Japan. But they look so fake. They have that over lit perfectness you see in video games. Plus stuff in the background of scenes is in focus, like whoever created them hadn't heard of depth of field.There is a scene towards the end of E2 with two characters in the foreground that are in focus and a building that must be several miles away is also in focus...weird.Then in other scenes they have purposefully blurred parts of the actors bodies, such as feet or hands, obviously done in post to add fake DOF.Anyway, if you can ignore all that, it's pretty decent.
1	"As a sci-fi enthusiast, I was drawn to ""3 Body Problem"" by its intriguing premise. However, my excitement waned as the series unfolded. The storyline, which initially held promise, lost its momentum after the first few episodes.While some cast members managed to maintain a semblance of engagement, the overall execution felt lacking. The script failed to delve into the depth and complexity required to keep me invested in the narrative.Eiza González's performance was hard to watch. It was high school drama class overacting.In the end, ""3 Body Problem"" left me disappointed. Despite its promising start, it failed to deliver a compelling storyline that could sustain interest throughout the series."
1	"Shogun is a great production with good actors, costumes, scenery, music, etc. A strong point would be its multilingual and cultural aspect, as the Japanese and English have their languages respected. It is unbelievable that the dialogues between the supposed ""Portuguese"" people are all in English, which often makes a scene incomprehensible, for example in E2, in which a Portuguese priest and Mariki ""translate"" a conversation with Blachthorne (who claims to be fluent in Portuguese) to Toranaga, but their ""translation"" is entirely from English to Japanese. In another scene, the same Portuguese priest, alternating between Japanese and English languages (with maybe an exagereted ""Portuguese"" accent), compliments Mariki for her ""excellent Portuguese"". Nonsense! It is not enough to avoid ""yellow face"" and other prejudiced aberrations and remain with this ridiculous language segregation. A shame."
2	An all time classic tv show - with a rather weak ending (hence the star deduction). Don't let that put you off too much though - the journey is more important then the destination, and this one is well worth your time.
1	"I wanted to give this series a much lower rating, but the overall production quality garners a few stars more. Walton Goggins helps the rating as well. However, you can tell this is a Bethesda take on the IP, and that's not a good thing. It's too clean, too playful. Fallout IS gritty and raw. The ""gory"" scenes in this even seem out of place, which is odd considering it's in the Fallout universe.Everyone seems to be praising the effects teams, and the majority of it is well done, but I'm a bit disappointed in the BoS power armor. For something that is not CGI, it looks like bad CGI. Not sure how that happens.If you only like Fallout 4 and Fallout 76, you'll probably like this. If you like Fallout 1, 2, and New Vegas, you'll probably just feel obligated to watch this. If you don't know what I'm talking about, well ignorance is bliss. I'm just surprised there wasn't micro transactions all along the way."
0	Great show at first but ruined by the end... Sad it could have been a must! Don't know if it worth watching the entire series when you know how it ends
1	Grey's Anatomy was the first medical drama which I started watching, and at first I really enjoyed it, however, as time went on, too much pointless dialogue between characters and filler scenes made this a chore to watch.
2	First of all I would like to highlight that I haven't play the game, I just knew for its existence. So my review is based clearly on the serie and nothing else.I'm a fan of the vintage vibe, I love everything of the 60'. I also love movies and series that refers to a post-apocalyptic world, so as you understand this serie it's the best combination for me and it didn't disappoint me at all. It's a very well made, the production is amazing. I loved the cinematography and the music of the 60', you get definitely to the mood which I believe is the half of the serie. The acting of the cast is also good, nothing special but yet not disappointed. As I know there will be another season and I'm glad for it because not all of your questions are get an answer. It's a kind of a serie that will make you play the game eventually and as I heard the sales of the game have been increased after the launch of the serie.I would definitely recommend to watch it either you played the game or not!!!
1	The last season is bad . The last season is bad . The last season is bad
0	"Stopped watching weekly due to all the ""schooling"" involved with this show on social issues. Seemed like it was week after week.. then the pandemic hit--certainly don't want to watch a COVID season after living through COVID every day.... finally, just stopped recording it.. revisited it on Netflix to burn some time and jeez, its really bad.. recycled storylines, same old Alzheimer's stuff- new interns - just nothing to invest in or look forward to..I was a devoted fan for 10 years... but, like all good shows, they had to jump the shark somewhere....feel this show has run it's course-time to end the misery.."
1	The first 10 seasons are amazing, more specifically the first 3-5 seasons. But the whole show just went down hill. It's so bad now though. I miss Alex!
0	"Do you like Fallout? Yes? Then forget Fallout 1, 2, 3, and Fallout New vegas. Forget the WAR, forget the Alaskan campaign, Battle of Anchorage and the Chinese campaign. Forget New Vegas, New California Republic and Shay Sand. Forget Caesar and the legion, the Enclave, just forget it. Forget everything you know about Brotherhood of Steel and Ghouls.The whole LORE is tailored to the Chinese market and to fit in the new Hollywood trends. Therefore 1 star, as a ""Fallout"" series.If you forget everything, It""s good series, nice black humor, good characters and plot in an alternative Fallout world. The ""not do fallout"" serie is 9 stars."
2	This is going to upset fans of the novel series, which I also read, begrudgingly. I kept reading because the story was so fascinating. I couldn't stop, but the way it was written was confusing as hell. Almost on purpose it felt like it was trying to convince the reader it should re-read the last three pages to try to understand what the hell is happening. I was so happy to hear this was going to Netflix because I knew that they could not make it the same way the books were because nobody would watch it. I was pleasantly surprised they are capturing the essence of the story, while the more confusing aspects nonexistent. Great show.
2	I went to bed thinking about this show and finished it the next day as I couldn't think past.This type of show will stay with you for a long time. I saw a reviewer say how stalkers are glamourised in media, think Netflix's You. This raw and haunting story of comedian Richard Gadd's real life experience of being stalked by a woman he met in a pub and befriended, shows a dark and refreshingly honest portrayal of a terrible stalking experience.Not only do we see the reasons behind why he did what he did, why he didn't stop when all the signs where pointing to danger, but the background to Richard / Donny's life is so incredibly brave.Rarely do we see this story line in the media happening to men, although it happens very frequently to women in movies and tv, and for that I think it will strike a chord with many people. I won't elaborate on this more without giving too much away.To summarise, this show is a must watch, but be warned it is not an easy watch and should come with trigger warnings.
2	"Before discovering this mini-series, I recently revisited the previous version.I don't believe every remake should be compared, but it's in human nature to do so.I agree with the comments about the black and white; I don't think it was necessary, and it would have been better in color. But I got used to it along the way.I generally liked that most of the show was in Italian; I suppose it also made me watch more attentively as I needed to follow subtitles along the way.Although there were some key differences from the previous versions, mainly how Tom lived his ""Dickie"" life, I also enjoyed this version. Sometimes it stagnated, especially in the middle parts, and I think it got more exciting in the last 1-2 episodes. In the middle parts, I found myself asking how come he makes all these mistakes, which felt contradictory to his character and experience. Then in the last episodes, they pulled it off in a better way. Acting was well done, especially Andrew Scott as the lead, which was expected from my end. I am not going into the details, but I generally enjoyed it; still, I think it could've been better."
2	I am only up to episode 3 and I really like the show but I don't believe it is 100% true. Sure, I believe he had a stalker but I think he made up a good chunk of this show. If it all did actually happen, then he and his stalker both have mental issues.The show kind of gives me vibes of You.I've been watching on a smartphone so one pet peeve I have is the incessant switching from live action to Martha's emails. Pretty small font on a smartphone screen so numerous times I've had to pause and zoom to read them. There's so much narration already, heck, I would have preferred Martha narrate that transition.Jessica Gunning needs awards for her performance.
0	Yep, as many others have said: Season 3 began the decline. Every episode panders and shames. I'm about 3/4 the way through Season 3 and will try to stick it out because of Nathan Fillion, but I doubt I'll make it much farther.It pains me to give the show one star because I love Nathan Fillion, but this show is now terrible. I never watched Castle, but I know he was great in that because my mother used to watch it and I had seen scenes when I would visit her.Of course, he was amazing in Firefly and Serenity as well as his many cameos in various shows (Big Bang Theory, Modern Family, et al) and Cayde-6 in the Destiny series. He's still good in The Rookie, but he can't carry it out of the wokeness.
0	"I was curious. Sufficient advertising from Netflix was available. I tried to keep it up, maybe I'll start all over again.Mr. Ripley actor is a respected actor. I would have liked that to bind me more, but I didn't. I could have accepted an Alexander Dreymon (TLK). He could have represented the conflict between danger and beauty well. But that's not what I'm about. The story was not well told, because everything was so obvious, I'm sorry showtime.Maybe he is appreciated by the ""industry"", if only because of the black and white subject.It wasn't captivating for me, actually I'm very disappointed."
1	"I am a little way into season 3 of ""The Rookie."" Today I clicked over to IMDb, wondering whether other people also started out really enjoying the series then became frustrated by the increasing preachy-ness. Yep.The show had so much going for it. Engaging characters, great action, just the right amount of humor, interesting and often unpredictable plots (both within an episode and multi-episode story arcs)...All that in addition to wrestling with complex issues faced by cops and society as a whole. That's great. That aspect gives the show heart and makes it more interesting.But then season 3 came. The writers got lazy, handing us lame dialogue, cardboard characters, and woke ideology served straight up. Remember, Rookie team, that most people watch a TV show to be entertained. If I want moralizing and preaching, I'll go to church or watch a Greta Thunberg clip.Please, get back to the season 1 vibe!"
0	So sad they are effing up a decent show with gimmicks. The writing (minus gimmicks), character development and acting are good, but season 4 is polluted by gimmicks. Please stop with the BS and simply tell decent stories. It is enough.Edit - rating lowered because season 4 continues to bite.Season 5 is better. They seems to have dropped the gimmicks and returned to story telling.S5 e16 back to the goofy as camera crap. Lowering rating again.I'm bored with relationship drama. The show was better before everyone coupled.
0	I really wish I didn't watch Season 8 Episode 3... The entire buildup was dumpstered, the plot was ruined, the writing fell apart, only the OST and the production quality stayed the same or even became better.I feel sad now, my favorite tv show is unwatchable thanks for such a disapointing and rushed ending to the greatest and biggest threat to Westeros.
2	I don't often post reviews but I was compelled to do so as I really can't understand the 1/10 reviews. It seems that some people can't move beyond the book or film. This is beautifully acted, beautifully shot. I found it a real feast for the eyes and mind. I binged watched it in two days which is a shame as I wished I'd made it last longer. At times I wished it would burst into colour as I remember the film which was very colorful and Italy is best served in colour. But the subject also excellently fits black and white. Enjoy and don't be put off by the strange reviews as this is a really nice series.
1	A bit disappointed.I sense this has been made with a touch of fear & a lack of respect for the original story. And as such it is simply based on the book & not an adaptation.But as a stand alone effort, it's okay.When I write, made with fear, this is what I mean:The brutality of the Samurai Japanese way of life has been powder-puffed over.But that way of life, the ying & yang of brutality & beauty is essential to the story & what makes feudal Japan so fascinating. The Book is packed with this juxtaposition as is the 1980 miniseries. It is so essential to the story.The casting of John Blackthorn is also disappointing. Blackthorn is a big/tall, 6ft+ northern European man. Packing power in all physical places.The casting of this sub 6ft, blue contact wearing actor, doing a Richard Burton impression, is also questionable. But he does okay.Shogun, is supposed to be the story of John Blackthorn, set in the world of feudal Japan. His journey through that world & his relationship with that world's puppet master as seen through both men's eyes.This miniseries almost makes Blackthorn irrelevant in his own story.This story, at times, is also unnecessary crass which undermines a pivot that Shogun revolves around. I repeat, unnecessarily crass & unauthentic. They have got Mariko wrong & the brush of girl power plays unauthentic & silly.I don't know if budget or bad choices led to important parts being cut, either way, it doesn't help.This miniseries as a stand alone, is not bad. It's just not an authentic, Shogun.
2	Three Body Problem on Netflix has more DNA from Jonathan Nolan's HBO Westworld than any other series I know of. Even tho I loved Jonathan Nolan's Person of Interest series, I did not care for the Westworld series. Why? It seemed pretentious; and, its narrative was disjointed to no benefit for viewers. These are typical signs of a project which has some good ideas and a big bugget; and yet, no deeply held conviction nor point of view.1899 (2022) was an expensive Netflix flop. It basically repeated the same errors as Westworld.Three Body Problem on Netflix has learned from Westworld and 1899 and corrects these exact errors. Thanks to the author Cixin Liu, the seemingly separate, disjointed storylines of the original novel can and do come together into a coherent whole. Success. It's very watchable.2) A second big problem Netflix's Three Body Problem solves is the problem of Asian actors having insufficient emotional range and nuance to engage Western audiences. Have you noticed this? Many not all Japanese, Korean and especially Chinese movies and actors have no problem with anger, grief and sadness. However more nuanced emotions between and above these basic emotions often escape them. This review is not the place to compare-contrast the strengths and weaknesses of Eastern and Western European cultures.Suffice it to say, ALL the leads in Three Body Problem do express a range of emotional nuance Western which can and does engage Western audiences. We even have two actors playing against type. BD Wong a hero in Marvel's Dr. Strange, plays a shlubby detective. BD has always had good range; he fits into this part very well. John Bradley, who played the comical conspiracy theorist 1899 (2022) was an expensive Netflix flop. It basically repeated the same errors as Westworld.Three Body Problem on Netflix has learned from Westworld and 1899 and corrects these exact errors. Thanks to the author Cixin Liu, the seemingly separate, disjointed storylines of the original novel can and do come together into a coherent whole. Success. It's very watchable.Eiza González, a Mexican actress, Jess Hong, a New Zealand actress of Chinese descent; and, Rosalind Chao (born in California of Chinese descent) are all more than capable of expressing a depth of feeling and nuance Western audiences are used to and will engage with.3) The VFX for Three Body Problem display Netflix's usual high standards for both creativity and quality.
0	I used to be a fan the first 8 seasons...but suddenly it changed from good show to..UNBEARABLE....they removed basically all the good characters (Lexi,Mark,Derek,Addison,Cali,George....) and put super annoying ones(Amelia,Maggie,Jo...) And the plot has no sense whatsoever...so in my opinion ,do us a favour and cancel it now...let other shows step in ,or create new ones....because this one is dead!!!!
2	The effect when you watch such a finely detailed show as this is mesmerizing, it sucks you into the world and time ... and the culture.Before an actor utters a single word in any episode there is the fact and nature of the world building that has been done in order to give them a stage to perform on. In the case of Shogun what has been accomplished is astounding, but it really comes into its own when the camera is tight and the sets and shots are relatively tightly constrained. Up close this world is utterly convincing - the costuming extraordinary.The script is also exceptionally well written and manages to convey a deep sense of Japanese culture (primarily of the upper classes) - but also tells its story very economically - it provides ample opportunity for nuanced communication.This brings us to the actors and the director and cinematographer who captured these subtleties - not easy to do with a light touch, managed here very deftly. The result is a show not over burdened with dialogue that tells part of its story some of its most significant moments, with gesture and response, subtle character action, a glance here, a hand movement, a tilt of the body, or the sweeping swish of fabric before composure again. On this level the show and its actors are quite magnificent - but there is room for special mention.Anna Sawai as Mariko is as refined and elegant as you'd expect from a high born and well educated noblewoman of the era, she is thoroughly steeped in the culture, captured here in very fine detail - Sawai's minute control is truly something to behold - very special indeed. So also Hiroyuki Sanada as Lord Toranaga - another brilliant and subtle performance from this fine actor.I've read some nasty dismissal of Cosmo Jarvis' Blackthorne - they miss the point. Of course he is uncouth, brash, insensitive. Of course his energy clashes with everything around him and he seems clumsy and arrogant and a bit useless. That IS the point, and the reality. His character is completely out of time and place - culturally he may as well be on another planet. The way he walks and moves is an affront to centuries of careful aesthetic, the way he sits, the way he drinks, the way he looks at people - all a culture shock. English arrogance and insensitivity gets a turn in front of the mirror. Well done.This show is sensational and ticks all the boxes - brilliant work by all involved. Not to be missed.
2	Everything about this series is done to perfection; the cinematography, the use of black and white, the costume design, the sound, the story, and of course the performances. Things not seemingly obvious are crafted with rigorous attention. The clomping of footsteps, heavy wooden doors closing, the clanging of typewriters, and heavy everyday objects add both to the overarching tension and to the nostalgia of a pre-computerized time. To add to this is the clean everyday formal wear adorning all of the characters in stark darks and bright whites, all set against the vertical architecture of Italy, and drenched in crisp black and white film stock. It's nothing short of brilliant.Andrew Scott shines as the most charismatic antagonist of today. Even though his character's actions are despicable, you're never rooting for his demise; in fact, you're secretly rooting for him to get away with his crimes.Dakota Fanning said that Steven Zaillian, the writer and director, had everything planned in meticulous detail, and it shows. I won't give away any of the plot, but do yourself a favor and start this series. Extremely bingeable and wholly engaging. A++.
2	Good pilot! Well excecuted first episode. Feels sometimes like an episode of SOUTHLAND which is good thing. Good acting, good designed action and interesting characters.
0	Never again will I invest myself in a long form tv series again like this, only to go through what I did in Season 8.To the makers of what could have been, but will not be, the greatest TV show in history: you can all go f...k yourself.
0	Allways the same boring pettyness among different department. Really hope that is not the case in real life.
2	"I didn't read the books. But I tuned in for this show, and I really enjoyed it!The plot is layered and has intelligent dialogue. I love the type of stories that can take the concept of ""First Contact with Aliens"" seriously. There's plenty of things in this plot that hadn't seen before in the genera.There were a couple of plot holes and some things I didn't think made sense. But I'll give it some leeway since it was so entertaining.This show was a breath of fresh air, that was a combination of: Entertaining, Thought-Provoking, and artistically shot.I am already looking forward to (hopefully) a season two!"
0	I haven't watched a show in many months and tried this one after seeing it as #1 on Netflix. What a disgusting, pathetic show with a complete and total loser of a main character. This is a completely overrated show and is very horrible. The only good thing about it is that you may feel better about yourself after watching this mess. The main character is the probably more pathetic and a bigger loser than his stalker. I watched the first 3 episodes and didn't think it was that good and neither did my wife. But, episode 4 came on and it was a completely different show and it made us sick. Do not watch this, it will be stuck in your soul forever and that is not a good thing.
0	This series fails on two levels. First, it fails to live up to the novel on which it is based. Then, it fails simply on its own. The treatment of the characters is so shallow that it affects our ability to understand their actions or to find them sympathetic. The story is told in a choppy, highly compressed way with lots of cuts that create needless confusion. (If you are going to waste 8 hours on this, you should probably watch a few episodes at a time so the flashbacks and jumps make sense.) The original characters are changed to fit modern DEI requirements and the casting is so ridiculous it must have been done by the beta version of Google Gemini. Yes, sure, quantum physicists can pout and gaze vacantly and wear a lot of lip gloss, but this group of five are highly implausible as five Oxford physics geniuses. Tik Tok influencers? Sure. Reality show stars? Absolutely. But not five great scientists.I have never seen the Chinese TV version. Perhaps someday there will be a new attempt at a Western version. For now, the original trilogy, in print, may be the best bet.
1	I have a sneaking suspision that Tod Howard had too much influence on this.And it seems they threw New Vegas under the bus.. One of the best fallout games ever.. If this is true it's really sad, and seemingly spiteful.. I enjoyed the show for the most part, was alot of strong preformances.But the first half of the show was far better than the second half.It seems like it had alot of direction and drive first few episodes and then just lost itself by the end.. All in all it's not a bad show and had some cool acting, humor and gore.. But was bogged down by wierd pacing later episodes and alot of tropes.. And some boring/small sets and very small finale fight..
1	I really enjoy this show...up to a point. I've rewatched seasons 1-13ish many times. But after that it turned just unwatchable. Why they haven't stopped the show is baffling. But again, the beginning seasons were great, great storylines and great characters. Then they decide to kill off your favorite characters or give them awful reasons to leave the show and recycle story lines over and over. And apparently all of the writers of the show hate happy couples because no couple is safe on this show...NO couple. And then of course they had to add the stupid covid crap and political nonsense into a whole season and it was just the worst thing I've seen. So again...great show, but stop after season 13.
1	This is an interesting story told reasonably well but let down by some poor scriptwriting and poor pacing. The characters are, by and large, acceptable but Liam Cunningham is alone in being head and shoulders above the rest of the cast. There's little tension at any point which doesn't engender any real commitment to the series. Scientifically it is typical tv sci-fi so nitpicking is pointless but some errors are unacceptable. My favourite is the scene when the plate on the spacecraft holding the cable attached to the sail comes loose. It is evidently held in place by screws (or, at best ,small bolts). It's a jerry-built spacecraft which so easily could have looked like it was built by people who knew what they were doing.
2	"Ripley is a captivating exploration of envy and fear, brought to life through stellar acting and a striking black-and-white cinematography. The contrast between the luminous beauty of Italy and the dark, brooding emotions of Tom Ripley is brilliantly portrayed, emphasizing the inner turmoil of Highsmith's complex character. Each scene is masterfully crafted to capture the essence of Ripley's psyche, thanks to the nuanced performances that breathe life into the characters. The serie pays homage to Highsmith's skill in character creation, delving deep into the intricate layers of human nature with a keen eye for detail. Overall, ""Ripley"" is a cinematic masterpiece that skillfully navigates the delicate balance between light and darkness, both visually and emotionally."
1	"When the Academy Training Officer Jeremy ""Hawke"" intentionally rams the back of his pickup truck into the front of the parked (but possibly still running) SUV patrol car of Nolan & Bishop the airbags are deployed inside of the patrol car supposedly disabling the vehicle.While it is possible for air bags to deploy on a running car that is in Park if struck in the front. It requires that there be occupants of enough weight be on the seats. And even though the deployment will turn of the ignition to prevent fires from leaking fuel or other flammable fluids. The vehicle can be started and driven immediately afterwards.Therefore, it's not disabled and they can pursue the fleeing suspect!"
1	-Terrible writing -Superficial characters -Amazing visuals (with sketchy CGI when the demand is too high) -Forced diversity -Hollywood audience pleaser -Lots of money in huge props and sets and no money into getting a decent script writer.-Just to pass the time and completely forget about it until the next season, which will simply mean another 4/5 days of entertainment.The books are outstanding. But it seems the creators are more preoccupied into pleasing targeted audiences and make their names good again after the unforgettable disaster they pulled on the ending of Game of Thrones.Well, task failed successfully.
1	So I've been watching this show for the past 4 months or so with my husband and it began pretty decent, with good laughs here and there. But after the main characters began to die or leave, it is not only boring, but the plot feels empty, like put together using the force, which is exactly what they are doing with their ridiculous situations where I find myself not laughing but wondering why I'm losing my time. So I stopped the first 4 ep of season 12.
1	I had high hopes for this series, but it disappoints. The unrelenting monochrome is harsh and seems like a mannerism.Andrew Scott, a fine actor, is sadly too old for the role, and doesn't get the sinister aspects of the role. Dakota Fanning and (especially) Johnny Flynn are somewhat more successful.But the least good aspect of this series is the pace. It is glacially slow, and my mind wandered several times. I feel the director is over indulgent. The camera lingers painfully slowly over the mundane. This means the series is a couple of episodes too long, and the last few episodes are especially frustrating with a noticeable lack of tension.Basically this was a wasted opportunity.
0	"I want to first state that I have not read the books, but have heard great things about them from others who have. Therefore, I was pretty excited to start this series. I am not sure how much was adapted from the book or how true the series is to the original. But I sincerely hope the books are a lot better than this.To start, this show is unpredictable, but not in the good way. More in like a ""there's no way this really stupid or random thing is going to happen, that would make no sense at all"" - but then it does happen, way. I will not spoil anything, but the ship scene comes to mind. This was an incredibly dumb and horrific event that had absolutely no reason to it. There are about 6000 other ways that the ship scenario could have been handled better and more realistically. Like I truly cannot put into to words how little sense went into that decision making. There are also various other scenes where characters make choices that are so random or outside of their ideals. This makes it hard to care about any of the characters, because none of them actually have true values or conflicts. There is only one character worth rooting for, but they are the one with the shortest amount of screen time.That's another issue I had, the characters and acting are just so bad. They add a bunch of forced scenes where the characters sit and have ""deep"" talks with each other, but it ends up being so boring and forced. In reality we learn so little about each of the main characters. The most I can say about them is: there's one who knows absolutely everything about physics, there's one who is pessimistic and just wants the world to die off, the rich finance one, and there's the Mexican one (I say that because that is literally the only information the show constantly throws at us about her).Overall the show follows no logic, is extremely underwhelming, and very rushed."
0	Could've been so much better... But sadly , oh so politically correct , overburdened with feminism and various agendas . Highly irritating female characters , especially those portrayed by Melissa O'Neill and Jasmine Mathews . Also , rather poor acting by these two . Nathan Fillion does a decent job as always and his character is a high point of this show . Season 2 is slightly better than 1st one . And as many others have noted .
2	There's a reason this TV adaptation is titled Ripley and not The Talented Mr Ripley. Or even, as another producer might have styled it: Patricia Highsmith's Mr Ripley. And that's because - although plot-wise this TV version stays much closer to the book than the 1999 movie - this is not Patricia Highsmith's Ripley. It is very much Steven Zaillian's Ripley. And, as such, it is first and foremost a director's exercise in film noir. So far as that goes, it is an exceptioinally stylish and moody recreation of noir. But while Highsmith's characters and story certainly lend themselves to a more broody treatment, Zaillian hasn't necessarily done Highsmith any favours in the scripting. The three main characters all become somewhat flat, and often more arch than real. Casting Tom with an older actor renders the character something of a seedy and desperate loser; it's not so easy to admire is ingenuity, or forgive his avarice. By contrast, the movie version is sexy and glamorous, and positively bursting with energy and passion. You instantly get why Marge loves Jude Law's Dicky, and why Tom wants to be him. Johnny Flynn? Not so much. Also, whjile Zaillian is all about maintaining the tension and the suspense, he also makes some choices that seriously undermine any plot credibility. It's bad enough that the police apparently fail to ever obtain a phot of the real Richard Greenleaf. But Zaillian has Marge sell her story to TWO Italian publications, who both choose to run stories about the Greenleaf disappearance with a selection of Marge's photographs - but not a single one of Richard. As if. Ultimately, Zaillian's focus on the intense press coverage of the case proves his undoing. Are we really supposed to believe that none of Italy's newspapers ever thought to obtain a photo of Richard Greenleaf from his parents, or his Princeton friends, or a college year book? Overall, while I enjoyed Andrew Scott's Ripley, Matt Damon's movie version is more engaging, more complex and more moving. Damon's Mr Ripley is genuinely *talented* and you're ultimately touched by his yearning and his despair. Scott's Ripley is, in fact, not talented at all; he mostly outsmarts himself, he's creepy as hell, and you mostly think he deserves to be caught. Which makes him not half as much fun as Highsmith intended.
0	What can you say...no one can write a good ending these days...pure crap
1	The early seasons were silly, but plausible. After Derek died, the storyline's got more and more ridiculous. It's hilariously stupid now.As far as a TV medical show, it's fairly predictable: fans of medical dramas will diagnose a patient half an hour before these doctors do, lots of crazy patients, and inoperable tumours which miraculously explain outrageous behaviours and come out easily with no downtime.Some episodes cover several months, which is annoying. Others gloss over incidents which should have been given more attention.Great guest stars though.
1	I think Merideth should be spending more time with her kids, and at her job. She hasn't showed the dedication she usually does for her job and her kids. I think Amelia spend more time with her kids than she does. Her new boyfriend is not working, he doesn't seem to care about her job (either one) or her kids. He wants To be her #1. And that goes to her kids. I would love to see her dedication to both her jobs and her kids. Much is selfish. Amelia and the other woman seem to do more than Meredith. If she isn't working she needs to be the mom she wanted to be. I really think Nick is bad for the show.
1	I read the original so obviously they bias my opinion. In the case of Avatar: The Last Airbender, I thought their choices where good. But, in the case of 3 Body Problem I'm not quite feeling it.For the first 5 episodes I was loving it. I had no issues with the changes in characters nor how they squeezed things to fit into the shorter time. But, from episode 5 on it just went downhill for me. The changes didn't seem like they added to the story or add to it. Rather they seemed like poor writing and bad ideas being jammed into the story with cliched scenes and responces. It started turning into a soap opera instead of hard scifiI wanted to reach through the screen and punch the nanotech scientist who couldn't understand the stakes. I didn't buy for a second someone that smart could be that stupid. Bad writing.The lead physics expert's scenes trying to convince her dying friend to, instead of do something amazing and meaningful with his last few days should instead sit in bed suffering. Probably the single worst writing ever. How they changed what actually happens to him also seems like it's going to turn into a new fiasco since it seems unsalvageable in any believable way to its importants later.Of course I'll keep watching, but it just goes to show how in the same way the producers ruined Game of Thrones it appears likely they're going to ruin 3 Body Problem as well. I don't mind if they change it. I mind that that changes are bad.
2	When, when is Greys Anatomy returning to the UK? It's been so long and it's already on in USA.....I need my fix. Admittedly it's not as good as it used to be but I still love it......come back soon.
1	Series started good. Its watchable.But somehow 46 yr old Rookie after a 6 month training became Rambo or Seal team level expert.His fighting style, skills, even detective skills are way above Captain or seasoned officer.LT is asking Rookie, what should we do?Rookie is going to mexico in a covert operation, doing undercover work with gang members.Rookie is taking done 10 skilled mercenary all by himself.
1	'' 3 Body Problem '' is a sci fi series.I haven't read the book or watched the 2023 chinese series, but this one was good enough. The first episodes were especially enjoyable and entertaining, with intense drama and enough thriller.The second part was not as thrilling though, and some parts were boring and felt more like a filler, with long dialogues.The performances were, on the other hand, pretty great by everyone in the cast and all of them did a good job with their characters.The sci fi was also well presented and handled, with good CGI that didn't ruin the series.So, overall, seven out of ten.
0	The premise of the show was promising. Then someone who had seen the first two episodes recommended it to me. So I gave it a go, but just one episode in I am shocked at how bad this actually is. All scenes seem fake, that voiceover annoys the hell out of me and on top of that it is really really boring.Honestly I do not understand the good rating. It is an absolute shame on Colin Farrels talent.I have a pretty high tolerance for not too good tv, can look beyond ridiculousness in a lot of series as long as there is a compelling story. This just does not bring that to the table. Boring, unconvincing, unbelievable, watching the second episode now, to see if it get better, nope... same boring stuff.
0	Andrew scott is too old to play this role, Matt damon was the perfect choice, the right age plus the slight resemblance with Judd low, that served the plot. Dacota fanning is so depressing and showed no emotions whatsoever she acted the same as she did in The mentalist. Too long unnecessary seens. I surely respect the black and white shooting , it created an atmosphere of the 60's but it deprived me from watching Italy and it's beauty. Couldn't understand how naive was the police inspector to be easily deceived by the funny disguise of Tom ripley on their last encounter and of course missing on the ashtray on which he commented earlier , for me it wasn't fun to watch.
1	Just finishing watching episode 1-5, and to be honest, the characters are fine, the pace of story telling is fine, and I really enjoyed how it put the story of the past into the story of current.However, WHY SO MANY ROMANTIC STRUGGLES? Dose Netflix have to shape characters by putting them into so many romantic relationships? They deleted so many important clues in the game and the deductions about how Jin realized that the problem in the game is three body problems. It's not that hard style sci-fic, more like a sci-fic soap opera.And, WHY PUT KIDS ON THE SHIP? There was no kid on the ship in original story so WHY BE SO CRUEL?
2	Grey's Anatomy ABC's longest running TV Series as of now, had an amazing storyline. However I do have to mention that over the last seasons I can say that the storyline isn't great as if the original cast was still here that would've been amazing. I am hoping for it to be renewed for another season and maybe we can see a original cast reunion I don't maybe. But I think I have to give Grey's Anatomy A Solid 9/10.
2	"The show is set in Seattle. As it has a great ensemble cast. Though it has been years since I have seen it. But still the show really peaked in the early years.We had to decide either McDreamy aka Patrick Dempsey or McSteamy aka Eric Dane. And that it also is like a second ""ER"" as it has wit, drama, charm, and how to get along while trying to compete for jobs.It is about surviving long working hours and days. And how to keep your calm. And the doctors and nurses working in and out of the hospital. And seeing different personalities one at a time.Meredith Grey hence her last name, is the narrator and it is seen through her eyes. Played by Ellen Pompeo with gutso and sympathy."
0	Typical Netflix idiotic tv series. We basically 3 problems here:1st - Casting. The actors are so dull I can't even think of how bored I got watching the first episode which was the only one I've watched.2nd - Story. It seems to be based on a book, man either this book is a disgraceful book or the producers and directors made an absolutely poor job in what pace is concerned as well as how a story should be told to entertain the viewer. This is not a slow-burn tv series, it doesn't even get hot. It's really horrible.3rd- Cliché, Cliché and Cliché...I think the name of the series is pretty fitting.
0	Now that the show is aimed to focus on a socialist far left view point that polling shows the american people doesn't agree with, the show is over for me. I really enjoyed the first two seasons and was looking forward to it's return. When you have a show with actors who feel they have an obligation to tell me how bad of a person I am, don't be surprised if I just don't want to watch anymore.I hope the majority of people pay attention and start rejecting this stuff. We watch shows like this to be entertained, not hear some actor in a glass bubble tell me how to think.
0	"I'm not sure where to begin with this show. It's a mess. It starts off intriguing but after episode 4 it feels so ridiculous that it becomes borderline unwatchable.It's not the aliens or the ""science"" that are hard to suspend disbelief for so much as the casting, acting and script. It's so melodramatic and hammy. However, Jess Hong deserves a medal for single handedly holding the whole thing together, despite the fact that she is working with garbage. I hope she gets an amazing role off the back of this.I've not read the source material but it very much feels like they are attempting to pack in too many events at the expense of elements like character development.Also the whole business about the San-Ti not being able to lie or understand lying seems like massive plot hole since at that point they have done very well at leveraging uneven information sharing."
1	Unfortunately this good show has deteriorated over the years with the current season hitting an all ever low... If identity politics is what you are after or the propaganda of racial issues is your jam you will like it, if not you should skip. Real sad because the actors are still great and it feels like their story is betrayed... alas all is ruined by the agenda, since everything it touches in entertainment is then focused on hitting its marks instead of producing good entertainment, nothing is spared, not even classics of cinema, let alone a 'modern' series like Grey.edit: By episode 5 (S17) it truly became unbearable to watch so I guess all things that used to be good must come to an end too. I am speechless... this is so sad and it used to be good. Now a flimsy soap opera with an overpowering serving of Black lives matter every other scene, not to mention how out of character that behaviour is for all cast but one. So off-putting! I'm out. The damage is done.
2	I never read the books or even heard of this story until it came on Netflix and even after watching the trailers, I was confused on what the story should be. But, it looked intriguing so my family and I decided to check it out. I'm so glad we did. The storyline is compelling and unique and the graphics are nothing short of amazing. We love science fiction and this show does a good job of blending sci-fi with human drama and intimate personal relationships. The acting is solid. The only critique I have is that physicists who look like supermodels is not that believable but this is TV so it's to be expected. The international cast is nice to see and we can't wait to see what the next season brings.
0	I started watching GOT after Season 3 - I was hooked by Daenerys in Astapor scene. I became a fan of the series and was thrilled and waiting for Season 7.Stupid plot, mindless decisions of the main characters, Stupidity with capital S. Is this the same Tyrion we know from the previous seasons, I wondered? Daenerys following idiotic plans and advises ...??? Even when she was in Qarth, she wasn't acting so erratic. Huge plot holes - like how fast can a raven fly from North to South? Obviously faster than a military jet according to the time line in Season 7.Season 7 reminds me of Guy Ricchi's King Arthur movie - you can't believe what you are seeing, checking if you are not in some alternate reality.I hope the people writing the GOT script take some pointers from my review and rethink the future last season.
0	Grey's Anatomy should continue and move to Boston with Meredith. Follow her, her research and kids. Have Maggie move there too, to help with research.Send Richard to Boston too, where is wife and Meredith are, and have Torres visit from NY, and Chistina from Switzerland.These characters are well developed and seem real.Only the 'Bailey' show is left in Seattle. The characters seem flat, and Bailey has become the only focus on the show, everyone else is just a bit part playing to her.Or, end it now as it is no longer a watchable show as it stands. Something has to change for it to continue.
1	This reboot is not as good as the original which is one of my favorite tv shows of all time. Despite enjoying the Japanese spoken (I speak it), the characters are not as compelling as the original. They seem to be one dimensional in comparison. Also, the script and storyline is much more haphazard. I can only assume the producers and writers thought this would be a more interesting and complex format. Instead, I feel the actors lack direction and often seem to just be reading the lines as best they can. My main concern though is the lack of character exploration which I feel the original series did in a much better fashion. Seeing Blackthorne become Anjin was a much more fulfilling experience in the original series for example. Still, compared to the typical dribble out there, it's decent.
0	I saw all the seasons before this season 8, I was very excited by the idea that the last season would have marked game of thrones as the best series of all time, even breaking bad. But it wasn't. Extremely ugly, they ruined everything.
1	I loved Got, but after season 8 episode 3, it just felt like a waste of time. The writers simply destroyed all the narrative of the series in a single episode. They subverted my expectations, but not in a good way. Until the ending of season 6 is great. season 7 starts the writing problems. Season 8 begins with two good episodes and then butcher all the story.
0	"Honestly, this is the best Netflix can do with $200 million? I could have done better with the chimp in Episode 7 on my phone using an AI generator and a drawing of Curious George. Was so excited for this after reading the books and watching the Tencent version (which, btw, comes close to bettering the ""big"" scene with the Judgement Day ship and I am sure cost much, much less). My expectations started crumbling with the trailer featuring that ""jaw dropping"" and ""awe inspiring"" winking universe scene, which in the book could only be seen through a special headset but here just...blinks on and off, literally (hide mask show mask hide mask show mask that'll be $250,000 thank you). Other than Benedict Wong, casting was almost completely off, and don't get me started on Elza Gonzalez as ""Dr."" Salazar. The series butches through the first book, makes major headway into the second, and the showrunners want 4 seasons? To do what? I say cut the budget to $50 million for a second season to wind it up and if we're lucky we may...just may...get a ""Wrath of Khan"" out of it. But don't count on it."
2	I really enjoy this, we don't get many cop show's in NZ.I hope they keep renewing this for years to come if it carries on the way it is.The added camera footage is awesome.The only thing that annoys me so far, is how slack the seatbelts are.... attention to detail!
2	"I am a fan of the old Shogun from 1980 with Richard Chamberlain , so I enjoy the retelling of the original story big time... So far the story follows quite precisely which is a good thing... The locations are great, the VFX is decent, there is a respect for source material which is good. It is nice that the Japanese actually speak Japanese ... Overall I would suggest watching ""Age of Samurai"" documentary before this as it perfectly sets the scene to understand which period this story covers. The only thing that this show is inferior to the original is the main actor can not replace Richard Chamberlain, nor anybody can replace John Rhys-Davies well enough , those actors were legendary, that is why 1980's version is totally worth a rewatch..."
1	First off, I have played the games, NewVegas being my favorite.I like the the very start when the bombs dropped... but I'm having problems with the rest.. Goggins as 'the ghoul' is 🔥. Lucy is OK.I hate everything with the Brotherhood. The whole operation isn't lore accurate and the whole storyline could (and should) be eliminated from the show... make them an outlying force with very limited interaction... what's been written here is junk.The pacing is garbage and some editorial choices are baffling.I basically liked the wasteland roadtrip vibe and the vault story.The show looks great, the soundtrack is great, though a tad overused.Overall. Tolerable... I won't rewatch and I won't beg for Season 2 (I might watch season 2, but I can take it or leave it.)
2	"The show was great, as a sci-fi fan, I absolutely loved it. Probably one of the best sci-fi shows I've seen in a while. Casting could've been a bit better but the story was interesting and thought provoking enough to keep me binge-watching. Don't mind the haters who rated 1/10 just 'cause they think it wasn't ""loyal"" to the books. If it's based on a book not every movie/show has to be loyal to the books, it just could be a different or altered version of it or there'll be some changes or some deficiencies because books are way too detailed and they need to get rid of some things to simplify and fit it into 8 episodes. So, stop with your obsessions with the adaptations and try enjoying the show instead of whining like a 9 yr old. Try to be a little open-minded, if not then maybe you should just stick to your books 'cause I've rarely seen where the audience actually liked an adaptation of a show or a movie that's based on a book."
2	Intellectually stimulating a great premise and wonderfully depicted. Made by the creators of Game of Thrones. Based on a book by Cixin Liu. A fresh take on the alien invasion story. All characters their own persona. Not very complicated like mostly suspense thrillers are. The story unwinds nicely. A good watch for someone who fancies being a scientist and likes space , mathematics. Friendship among them is depicted well. Good take on how villains are born after the experience injustice done to them in their own lives . Perfect series to binge watch overnight. Cannot wait for the next season to be released.
1	"Its a New view on the Fallout universe and in my opinion its good. If you love Bethesda latest releases ( FO4 and FO76) you will love, watch and rewatch this series....if you're more a Obsidian / Originals you'll surely have a more critical view but try to watch it for what it is - a New aproach on a beloved Universe and if you dont like the games and just want a post nuclear world like Mad Max or something with a more serious Tone, just avoid it at all costs - isnt for you, its for the Bethesda/Fallout game Fans.Its entertaining,fun to watch but with some debatable choices like choosing a more humorous aproach instead of the lore friendly one or the depiction of some characters( ghouls) or "" monsters/ creatutes"". It's generally filled with solid and sometimes good acting moments, what makes it good but Not great."
0	This show is very slow and the narration is a little annoying, the characters aren't very interesting and it seems to always be based on the relationships. The whole 'choosing' gets really irritating....This is supposed to show how surgeons operate in the work place but seems to be a rip of an 'teenn soap'/ER.... The actors have no real talent, they seem to be playing themselves and the story lines are weak...the only positive thing is that the hype will probably see that this show has at least six or seven seasons on the air.Overall it is slow and dreary......
0	I was happy to invest time in this despite many concerns about implausible characters and settings, and for the first few episodes it kept my interest.But as time went on, the characters and settings just became more and more cartoon-like, and completely implausible situations and settings started to become the norm.The killer for me came when a room of 'supposed' scientists completely failed to spot a gigantic hole in one of the main scientific tenets (I won't spoil it for you, but just to say it's to do with accelerating masses and completely overlooking that the larger masses in question would also have to be accelerated way beyond our capability). This isn't a debate, it's just plain impossible. And therefore, none of what ensues in the supposed resolution is possible.And then there's the ridiculous scene in the hospital with the signing of the contract. What on earth (literally!) is the point of this? If the guy reneges on his contact it is too late and therefore has no value.And then there's the frequent telegraphing of what is going to happen, sometimes multiple episodes ahead.I'm really annoyed I invested time in this trash.
2	I just finished watching it from beginning to end. I played the PC game Fallout 4 but never finished it. The series at the other hand was very compelling for me at least. Only problem I can find as far as I can see is First Act introducing the world of Fallout although great , is a little bit long and tedious and might be turn over for casual viewer. Fallout starts with a nostalgic jittery aura of an alternate future with 1950'ies aesthatics when bombs begin to fall but then after centuries later we are introduced with a very naive and insular isolated society of vault dwellers living their lived not interracting with any surviving human communities at all ( or so ity seems) From then the story and conspiracy involving it unfolds with flashbacks to pre nuclear war era step by step.The writer Jonathan Nolan's reluctance and deep suspicion of corporate culture and wild free for all capitalism is all plain to see in it. ( there was something similar in his previous tv series Person of Interest and even Michael Emerson from that show guest starring in one episode here in Fallout)Ella Purnell as main heroine Lucy , Vault 33 dweller searching her father is quite a find for me and Aaron Muten as her co star Maximus Brother of Steel squire holds own his own. ( the building romance has a macabre humour in it) But as far as I concerned best performance was from Walton Goggins as Ghoul the Bounty Hunter and his previous Western Actor character before the nuclear war , Cooper Howard. Goggins was great in his dual role especially as badass and snarky Ghoul but I bet he had fun with pre war 1950'ies aestetics driving car or wearing fashion of that era.
1	"What the 1980 Version has the 2024 doesn't: * actually filmed in Japan * actual love story in the book * better themed music (tho action music wonky) * follows the book * has contrast of great sunlight vs rain * more screen time for crew & Christian enemies * paced, immersive bc it takes its timeBoth have many Japanese actors, nothing new in 2024 version. The 2024 guts the boom, ignores strong side arcs, some main characters don't have screen charisma. Being shot in British Columbia, it's almost always overcast, foggy, rainy. Very unlike Japan. They pushed ""authenticity"" and blew it with location, not following the boom, making up scenes not in the book like they knew better, it's a decent watch but overall total failure to bring passion, adventure, variety of entertainment the 1980 version slays at.The book is best of course. Read that first.My lasting impression of the 2024 version is I never saw any real sunny shots. Shame. All seemed like a Pall over the film."
0	The main problem with this rehash of the 2 Ripley classics is not the odd black and white decision (in colorful Italy!) It is the casting. Tom presents as a man in his 40s to 50s, much older than the part needs. He looks worn and weary with eye bags and receeding hairline. He huffs and puffs up those the stairs. There is little that is glamorous or sexy about him. This throws all of his relationships into disbelief -- especially with Dickie, his (supposed) contemporary and object of his desire.Homoeroticism is a core component of the vastly better first 2 films and novel. Alain Delon is perhaps the sexiest actor of his generation, with his icy blue eyes and criminal undercurrent. Matt Damon brought the perfect blend of preppy golden boy with master manipulator. Jude Law is the best Dickie, and Gwyneth Paltrow the best Marge. Both nail the breezy, upper class marks critical to the story. The rest of the cast in the Damon classic is equally superlative.The question then is, what were they thinking with this latest cast? Almost everyone is miscast. The casting decisions make this version dull and drab, without any of the spark of the two classics. The actors are all fine, they are just wrong for this rehash. It's like remaking Cat On A Hot Tin Roof without actors that can match the beauty and talent of Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman.Anyway, why even try to attempt a remake of a classic? The audience is better served by watching the 2 outstanding originals. (And they're shorter!) Don't waste your precious time.
2	This excellent period piece is set mostly in Italy over a six month period beginning in late 1960. About 10 minutes into part 6 there appears a receipt dated 11 January, 1961 for a one week car rental until 18 January, and in the very next scene is featured a Jaguar E-type, a.k.a the famous XKE, parked on the street.There are two temporal problems here. The Jaguar E-type didn't debut until March, 1961 at the Geneva Auto Show, after which very few cars were released for public sale. So, there can be no way for it to have appeared in Italy two months earlier. Still more problematic, the featured car is clearly from the 1970 model year.But for the temporal disconnect I would rate this series at 10/10. Incredible cinematography, writing, acting, directing ...
1	So imagine you go into an ice cream shop and you order a sundae. They've got all kinds of nice stuff going on, beautiful delicious soft serve vanilla bean ice cream, some hot fudge, freshly cracked up peanuts, woah what is that?? A brownie? Some delicious house made whipped cream... Man this sundae is gonna be spectacular. Wow what more could you ask for? Cherry on top? Bring it on!!And then all of a sudden they put an anchovy on top, and then another, and then a couple more, and then squirt some Dijon mustard on for good measure.You don't even want the sundae anymore, in fact, you can't even look back on how nice that sundae used to be without thinking about all the stupid s*** they did at the very end just when it was going so well.That's essentially Game of Thrones. I tried to rewatch it, but as I got through the first season I began looking at where all the pieces land at the end it's literally impossible to go back to. There are just so many ruined character arcs, so much pointlessness, and every time I come back here I drop it one more star it seems like. Game of Thrones is a beautiful anchovy sundae.
0	I don t understand how so many are saying the storyline is accurate. IT IS NOT!Toranaga is skinny instead of fat. BlackThorn doesn t like like a sailer AT ALL not does he speak like one.Everything is fast forward...one event after another without a link between them.Nice they speak japanese but that s it.I love Shogun but somehow I m not having a good time watching this show. There many flaws.I also don t understand why my review has to be sooo long in order to be accepted.There are only 3 episodes out. What more can I say???Nebdjdjfjjfjfkcjjccdjxjxjxjcjcjcjjcjcjjdjsjdjjdjdjdjjdjdjdj.
2	Really enjoying this show! It achieves a good balance of portraying both serious and everyday issues. I appreciate that the characters develop with the experiences they encounter--they grow and change and learn about themselves. The acting is excellent across the board. The presentation is engaging without being unnecessarily dark or twisted. There is an appropriate level of action, and a realistic interaction amongst the characters. The show keeps your attention, challenges the viewer to reflect on the greyness of policing, and delivers comic moments naturally.An area of improvement would be long-term continuity. For instance, a romantic relationship at the series beginning is tossed away as if the writers had second thoughts about that line. Ok, fine, but the characters then go on as if nothing ever happened. Another example is the role of the Captain. At first she is actively engaged with the team. After a dramatic development, the team no longer interacts with a Captain. To be entertaining, the show doesn't have to be realistic in regard to the actual LAPD procedures, but it should be consistent within its own fictitious world.
1	"A series with lots of strengths a solid performances. Sticks reasonably close to the source material, not too significantly dumbed diwn. It is however utterly let down by some simply shocking casting choices. Most damagingly, Eiza González does not appear in a scene without acting as tho in a photoshoot for a fashion magazine cover. In every shot, even ones where she is portrayed as just waking up after a night binge drinking, she has supermodel, 2 hours worth of make up. The other characters continually comment ""you are beautiful"" to her, and she strikes another pose.This shatters any willing suspicion of disbelief and spoils what otherwise would have been a decent series.Watch the Chinese version instead. Sorry."
2	Well cast and written. Stellar performances from the core cast. Gets the tone and art style of the games almost perfect. Very good and watchable for fans and casuals alike. Some potential (but fixable with a season 2 or future game) game continuity problems, weird choice of arm rockets over the game beloved jet pack and slightly rough de-aging in one scene are the minor points that JUST hold the show back from perfection. Really does put almost all other video game adaptations to shame. If this level of quality is maintained, I really hope they make a season 2. 9/10 from both me (game fan) and my partner. (New to the franchise.)
0	"What are you doing??? This used to be a good show that I looked forward to. It's utterly unwatchable at this point.First, stop the crossovers! I don't want to watch Station 19. I can barely watch Grey's, which I've invested over a decade in. I'm definitely not starting another show considering how awful this season is.Second, what happened to Miranda? This is a show that called Miranda ""The Nazi""! Now, it's trying so hard to act like America's social conscience that it turned an intelligent, strong, capable woman of color into a sniveling mess, who is practically incapable of performing in any leadership capacity? Also, have we milked the Meredith storyline enough yet? Apparently, Link & Amelia don't really even work at all anymore. They just stay home and watch Meredith's children.I tried fast forwarding through the overblown social preaching, but this week's episode left me with about 3 minutes. I hope Shonda Rhimes intended to make people ready for a cancellation after this season. It's the only thing that makes any sense at this point."
0	"I've forced myself to watch two of the episodes before writing a review. Seriously, 8.7 , Gone with the Wind is 8.2! And like its famous ""I don't give a da*&"" line, episode 2, will create the long lasting ""He was screwing my chickens"", which I'm sure will go down in movie history. Why no mention of Demolition Man in the other reviews. The female character is S. Bullock, ditzy, naive but has the chutzpah underneath. And the exosuits have been used 10 times b4. No nose guy just made me think white Michael Jackson. All these gamers have put this in a rating it doesn't belong. Good special effects."
0	"It's intrinsically a gripping story and in this version this kicks in after a long, long time, when Scott and Flynn finally go on the boat trip. After that, the plot kept me watching. However - and it's a big however - the script is flat and the acting flatter. Andrew Scott barely moves a facial muscle throughout. Whatever makes Ripley of any interest to Greenleaf? He's a total bore. There is no sign even so much as lively conversation between them. Johnny Flynn is equally bland. He affects a semi-growling monotone. Playboy glamour? Next to none. As has been noted elsewhere, they are both far, far too old for their parts - in Scott's case by about 20 years! A 27-year-old actor might have prsented us with a ""hungrier"" and at least livelier Ripley. A very strange feature of the plot near the end is that the American detective correctly works out (guesses?) what's what and asks the key question (which I won't give away here) but promptly drops it. Why? It's not the only puzzling and convenient feature of the plot, but I won't say more."
2	"Remembrance of Earth's Past might be, if not my favorite book series, on the top three. When I've heard they were adapting it for Netflix, I was scared. When I've heard who was behind the project, I was even more scared. But, on the same time, I was... kind of hopeful? Sure, we had the Tecent adaptation... The news about the cast and and the teasers left me even more fearful.I did get hopeful from time to time, like when I heard they were calling the others ""San-Ti"" and now ""Treesolarians"", showing they went back to the original language books.I was right to be scared, and I was right to be hopeful.The adaptation if good, but good in a very different way the books are good.It is the same story (mostly), and they are being faithful to it (mostly). It can't compete with the books regarding the science, but it is good where the books are weak (character development).The casting works. Liam Cunningham is going a great job. Marlo Kelly is perfectly cast. Benedict Wong is spot on. Everyone else is going a competent job at the very least.The pacing is faster than the books but, then again, how could it not be. But not so fast that they don't take their time to show us the characters.Even having had the books and knowing the story, it is worth the watch. Not only as an adaptation but, mostly, by itself."
1	Really enjoyed the first two seasons. Season 3 is crap
0	As a woman and a non game fan I wouldn't recommend this show. It is made well but has nothing in it I want to see. It is essentially the game turned into a tv show... but that doesn't mean I will want to see any of it. Some examples from the first two shows... the main character, alleged to be a spoiled girl, essentially has sex with a raider (criminal) under false pretenses, has her father kidnapped, and her response... go out into the very scary world to get him back. Um... that is what a character in a game does... no girl has those reactions. Soon we are introduced to a character that has his foot taken clear off and dies from the bleeding and what does this girl do? Removes his head as he asked. Right, as you do? There is no humanity in this show, just game characters and thus no one to root for.
2	What's great about Fallout is that you can go completely blind into it, not having played the video games, and you'll still understand everything and be immersed in the world and story being told. For those who've played the games, it's real treat seeing the world and all the lore-related things come to life on the tv screen. The set designs are impressive, the CGI is solid and the attention to detail is on point. This is a show that does justice to the games while also telling it's own unique story. If you've played the games, you can tell they did their research and really tried to emulate the style and feel of the world. The aesthetic, the look, the feel, the tone - they nailed it all. It felt very surreal to watch a video game world come to life in live action so seamlessly. The cinematography and lighting is top notch and definitely elevates the whole experience. The music, done by the same guy who did the music for Game of Thrones (Ramin Djawadi), did a great job with the score.Walton Goggins is iconic and amazing as The Ghoul. His character's arc was really interesting to watch. Ella Purnell did a fantastic job playing Lucy. Lucy is the definition of how you write a strong female character. Woke Hollywood can learn a few things from this show. Her charm, her humor and those big pretty eyes really sell it. Lucy's character development was one of the best. Seeing her go through her tough journey, growing as a person and character, while also discovering the truth, was insanely satisfying to watch. It's not only how you write an interesting and compelling female character lead, but it's also how you write any great character arc. Everyone's a beautifully flawed character and it works especially in the world of Fallout. We get to see how far someone is willing to go in order to get what they want.The storytelling is probably one of the most compelling and amazing things about the show. It reminded me a lot of the way Pulp Fiction is told. The way it jumps around to different characters' stories and the way it goes back and forth from the present to the past and back again. Really great storytelling going here. The acting is top notch, never once did it feel corny, lame or phony. The one thing that can be a bit over the top at times is the blood and violence. It can be quite brutal. But you gotta remember, this show is based on a game where getting a perfectly placed headshot on an enemy makes their head explode into a million fleshy pieces. And you also gotta remember the post apocalyptic messed up world in which it takes place in. A lot of times they use these super violent moments as a way of injecting a bit of dark humor - and it works. The humor in this show reflects the dark humor in the game.Overall, I was unexpectedly impressed and satisfied by Fallout. I went into it with no expectations hoping that it would be great and it turned out to be something amazing. It's an incredibly well-made and put together show that's worth watching regardless if you've played the games or not. Highly highly recommend it.
1	"The pilot way heavy on the cliches & stereotypes (""he's old"" joke every 2 minutes, sometimes less). It's a recurring motif throw out the series. ABC played it safe casting Fillion as lead, if you are a Fillion fan you will most likely be watching. I was never a fan of his, so his presents it somewhat distracting, it would have been more entertaining to see a fresh face, an unknown actor in 40-50's for this. But here is the weird part: Fillion fans don't like it because he ""deserved better"" (come on people, he can't play the 35-ish charmer anymore) and as far as I concern- it's a decent casting for his age (being playful with the age issue). BUT- Fillion looks bloated. Too much nip and tucked, yes, Fillion is skinny again (he got fatter as Castle progressed) but looks bad.The show itself has decent action scenes but many plot holes or unbelievable things in it. There isn't much currently on TV that I like (The rookie comes on ABC's Forever time slot- now that was an unjustified cancellation!), this show is O.K-ish. Will I be watching an episode every week? no. Maybe keep track of it every couple of weeks."
0	The first 5 season were good but they stretched so much its boring now. I actually stopped watching after season 16 because it was just creating stretching stories.
2	Oh my friends; what else can we expect? it is certainly amazing in soo many ways.
1	I started watching this show because of Nathan Fillion and it turned out to be amazing. Season 3 got hit by the woke train and it's just appalling.
2	"Wow just literally binged it all in one sitting. Not sure what i was expecting but wasn't all that. So many things going on, themes and topics and feelings. Intense. This show likely hits so hard being based on S true story told by the person who experienced it, and so many others saying ""the main character makes bad decisions so I couldn't watch"" that's cause he's human and it's what us humans do. I don't know what to think or feel after watching this, mainly some sadness and empathy for him or others going through similar things, I can't imagine how much something like that can take over your life but this shows it fairly well... and the process on how to get help, if you can from like police, or how to mentally deal with it, is complicated to say the least."
2	If you thought this was about reindeer, you will be sorely mistaken. It's just a nickname given by the stalker to our protagonist. It will make sense, eventually. Although nothing else does.This was powerful. I found myself, as a woman who has had abusers and stalkers, very triggered in some parts. It flips the script on what is usually spoken about and shows us another side which doesn't get the same attention. Men can be victims too. Women can be harmful. Men are not automatically protected from other men.It rattled me to the core with familiarity; The way his friends joked about it, and encouraged it The way the police blew him off The way he was accused of leading her on The way his kindness was misread as attraction The way she managed to physically overcome him to cop a feel The way he was ignored while clearly expressing 'no' The way someone you trust can turn on you in an instant if they have a chance at you with lowered inhibitions, You'll not find a woman who has not had at least one of these things happen to her. I love that it's in the spotlight as happening to men, I don't wish to take away from that, let's just hear that same outrage for women.If you can get past that angst, it's pretty cooked. Worth the watch, but be prepared to be uncomfortable.
0	"I think it's my fault for believing the reviews before watching a Netflix series.Because it's a worse production than another, in every way: script, character development, plausibility of situations, etc... I know it's a science fiction series, but my god, the decision-making of some characters just isn't worse than the ""explanations"" for such decisions.Summary: it's a typical Netflix production: Reasonable premise, terrible execution (even though the photography is beautiful), unsympathetic characters (so much so that I couldn't care if they die or not).A consistencia da netflix em piorar quaisquer narrativa é impressionante."
1	After third episode Ive become very disappointed they cut out so much Blackthrone saving Toranaga was given small shift they didn't ever go into Blackthorne visiting the black ship and getting saved by the other pilot Why did they cut these out or charge the story. The 1989 Broadcast version followed the book better then this. I guess for a new generation but I would suggest watching the original tv showBy the same I mean its staying pretty clear to the 80's mini-series. You have to understand at the time this was not a normal tv thing. And the amount of sex and violence was big for the time at Primetime network. I like this version ok except for two main things. The music....is awful everyone should be fired from the music department. And whoever graded the color of the film and look its to dark to much at beginning I wish spend more time at the first couple days and how important his time in prison was especially as they have time to add this stuff bug guessing there keeping it for the big battles at the end.
0	I stopped watching this a few years ago, the storylines were beyond ridiculous and it felt like it was being forced on the world. I went back to it during lockdown because I felt like i had watched every tv show ever made. Nothing had changed really, still the same ridiculous storylines but now with added new characters that made me want to punch myself in the face. This sister house story is creepy and so unbelievable that the writers and producers must be wetting themselves that people are still wanting to watch it and for it to continue. It's about time they put the world and show out of its misery and end it.
2	I thought I was facing the first two boring episodes!After finishing two episodes, I realized that I was nailed to the ground, and after a long time, I am going to watch an attractive and shocking series. The story of the series continued beautifully and the characters were in their right place. The only point I had until this moment was why there was no more news about the crew of the ship and what fate has been decided for them until this moment?Using the Japanese language and showing the Japanese people with their own language and culture was another positive point that I was interested in.I hope that we will witness an attractive and stunning ending.
0	Thx for ruining my life D&D10 years for nothing just because D&D want to ruin Star Wars even more if it's even possible, If someone can it would be those two (censored)Season 1-6 is 9/10 Taking everything that made the show so greatSeason 7 ok? maybe a 4/10Whole Season 8 is -10/10It is so rushed and the character arcs are just gone, maybe they forgot about It. Well i hope they never forget how many fans they have disappointing. All character are blank slates nothing they were building up to do was blow away MUH KWHEEN!Now if some big series come out, i have to wait 10years to watch it because I'm afraid it will happen again. So they have absolutely ruined that part of my life WHEN I AM AFRAID TO WATCH ANOTHER SERIES. (sorry if the spelling is a bit of and the grammar to. English is my 2nd Language and i'm so angry whit this abomination of a ending to a masterpiece)
1	Perfect until Christina left after that it is a waste of time you will watch every single character you love leave season by season
0	Season 1 and two I rated as 7 or 8 stars. In season 2 it stop being less about cops catching bad guys and more about stuff happening to/between the characters giving it more of a soap opera feel.Then in season 3 came terrible camera as viewed from a body cam. Why they think watching video a from a body cam with extremely shakey video is cool is beyond me.Now in season 4, some gang banger must have taken over the music selection blasting really annoying music during action scenes.It's looking more and more like they are trying to kill the show off.
0	Some will love this, some won't. After 4 episodes I'm not sure if I want to revisit the remaining hours. In summary: I didn't like the black and white. The whole story is noir so contrasting with fabulous colours of Italy would have been good counterpoint. The B&W made it all rather drab.I thought the characterisations could have been more engaging.I thought the best player was the Postmaster. He actually seemed more sinister than Ripley.Dickie is living the most wonderful life in Italy with a beautiful woman in his bed and yet he seems so disengaged from everything.If you don't mind spending 8 hours of your life watching a slow B&W movie where you already know the plot..go ahead. I wish I could give it more stars.
0	Either write Maggie as a stronger, less self absorbed character or write her out. She is so self absorbed and whiny. I have been over her for years. Also, new residents same script. Stop trying to revive the first Grey's residents. Let the newbies have their own personalities instead of trying to be like the OGs. You have written them to be so self absorbed and whiny. Trying way too hard. So unbelievable. Who is writing these scripts. Also, what happened to Amelia's love interest? Altman? Let Winston move on and find a better love interest who is smart, compassionate, and a Dan good surgeon who accepts him for who he is...And April and Jackson...bring them back.
0	I've just had it with poor renditions of Sci-fi. Fallout is no different. It starts with promise, but unlike Silo it gets bogged down in constant technological and relationship distraction designed to keep your attention, much like The Walking Dead. It even borrows the mysterious Ed Harris character played by Walt Goggins from Westworld. But ultimately it's a story about a young woman's quest to rescue her father and the trials and tribulations she encounters along the way. The characters are uninteresting and contribute little to furthering the narrative with the exception of Walt Goggins. The sweet melodies of yesteryear soundtrack, a la Nat King Cole, The Ink Spots and Bing Crosby make little sense played to the vicious war scenes with Real Steel like robots and a ghoul. It's just so unsatisfying. But what do you expect when a production is based on a video game?Further: it checks all the Hollywood PC demands that are now standard policy or productions will not get made. This is the world we now live it. The actors' ethnicities and so on take precedent over writing, acting ability, and story telling. Meritocracy criteria for character choice is a thing of the past...
1	You have to know it would be an adaptation and not entirely faithful to the book. After all, it has to have contemporary woke elements, like gender and race-swapped characters, millennials pretending to be experts, and diverse casting for a story that originally has almost all Chinese characters. And since there aren't enough key characters for Benioff and Weis, a bunch has to be created to weave more complicated character arcs.Once you choke down the initial nausea and stick with it for a couple of episodes, the main story straightens out and stays mostly on track. The China-based flashbacks that tell Ye Wenjie's story that triggers the course of events are reasonably true to source and done well, even as the London-based invented mess meanders, while Benedict Wong's character and performance is initially buried and wasted.The VR simulated world of Three Body is very well done, high budget, and it shows. By the third episode, the show begins to take better shape and redeems itself, and, at least for me, allowed me to assimilate the changes that were made to the source, and becomes watchable. I might even be able to start a drinking game to call out actors brought over from GoT.Having previously watched Tencent's 30-episode adaptation (that's far more faithful to the book), I almost would have wished that version had the same budget and treatment. But for what it is, this appears to be a quality production worth watching.
2	I was about to quit on the show until I watched episode 4. I was getting annoyed as to why Donny was allowing Martha to get away with as much as he did. Call the police, tell her to f off. I wanted to shake Donny. Why would anyone allow this to go on. Then I saw episode 4. This show is not for the faint hearted. It will make you feel very Uneasy. The story being told is written and happened to the main actor. Real bravery to put this out there in a series like this. Great acting.( character limit filler here) I watched episode 4 as a download on a plane and I didn't notice we had landed for a good 5 minutes was my shock about what I had just watched.
0	"The first two episodes were promising but then it starts to fall apart. Too many unnecessary subplots, graphic violence and sex. Might as well be another Game of Thrones.For example in episode 6, there is war on the horizon between Lord Toranaga (Sanada) and the council led primarily by Lord Ishido (Hira) but the focus here is on the negotiation of the price for the courtesan Kiku (Kouri) to spend a night with Blackthorne (Jarvis) in what is supposedly a seductive scene hence the title of the episode ""Ladies of the Willow World."" This happens after a major earthquake; Mariko's (Sawai) flashbacks; Lady Ochiba No Kata (Nikaido) plotting war - which are all glazed over subplots. The Noh theatre scene even has more screen time than the major storyline.If it's not for Sanada, I would have stopped watching, even he seems bored. Another critic who read the book and watched the original 80's series commented that the writers must have skimped over the pages or didn't bother reading it altogether. This lack of research shows in the way the characters behave and talk as if they're in the 20th Century, not feudal Japan.The characters are under developed, no chemistry between Mariko and Blackthorne. The Portuguese priests are sidelined when they are crucial to the story. Half way through, we're now learning of the link between Mariko and Ochiba and the latter's vengeance for Toranaga. The editing slices and dice up the scenes which makes the story confusing to follow. With four episodes to go, I'm not having high hopes. Such a wasted opportunity, could have been a standout series based on a best selling book or the Japanese history which should have provided a lot of material to get inspiration from. But alas, it's the 21st Century and it's all about instant gratification, lazy writing where truth doesn't matter anymore."
0	Used to enjoy this show when it was about The Rookie Cop and his police struggles. After watching - S6. E2 The Hammer - I'm giving up on this show. That episode was more like Eastenders than a cop show. And looking at the next episode, predictably, it's more of the same.I'm used to these topic shows eventually turning into soaps but the writing and story here is so bad it's criminal itself.5 mins of a very poor cop show at the end and 40 mins of slapstick poorly scripted clowning around. A bad mix of very predictable concepts with the unbelievable.This show is done, bin it. It's lost it's way, to many poor relationship side stories which now domination and repeat time and again. And why does this firefighter girlfriend have be in every episode not doing every job of the medical to chemical spills. Are they trying for another spinoff with her?
1	I did watch this in one day and I was thinking throughout that it was a differerent and interesting story but many things did not make sense. I don't want to believe that this was based on a true story because of these disturbing things like, why didn't Donn talk to a therapist? Why didn't the police take more action given the fact they had a convicted person who had started doing the same actions for the ones she was convicted for? Why didn't Donn report his rapist? Why didn't Teri herself go to the police and report her beating from Martha? Why didn't Donn or his parents get the advise of a lawyer on how to act? And what was with the ending, him going to his rapist and accepting a job by him? I mean, it's a story out of the ordinary but it still doesn't make any sense. No person in 2024 should act like this. Or I hope that to be the case...
2	If you watched Castle you'll like it and if you didn't watch Castle you'll like it. > It far exceeded my expectations. It's a solid cop drama with suspenseful story lines and some comedy mixed in to keep it from being too heavy. if you like a good cop, detective show, definitely watch this one. > It's my favorite genre, so I've watched a ton of police/swat/CIA/FBI/NCIS/ special-ops/type shows, and this one is right up there with the best of them.
0	3 body problem is a book trilogy that details an advanced alien civilisations intent to conquer earth but far from being easily digestible; the original content is cerebral and nihilistic - def not fit for general tv consumption. Uou have to wonder why these 2 wouid choose to bring something like this to screen. I won't spoil the overall ending of rhe books but it goes nowhere fun. This adaption is mediocre; from the bad casting, bad acting, bad cgi and overall choices of what to include/exclude from the source material. The season ends with wel, a whimper. Get used to that.The script and pacing is off (Better than the Chinese one though) but the science and common sense (which wouid have made this tense and cool) quickly flies out the window at light speed.Overall, a pointless watch and a waste of yoir time. Thanks again GOT ruiners.
2	Glad to see Nathan Fillion back. Had a good mix of comedy and drama some technical errors but it's a dramedy, can't wait to see where they take us on this journey.
2	"At first I was skeptical of ""Grey's Anatomy"" and was hesitant to start watching the series. After all, the show had originally aired a full eleven seasons ago so why should I just pick it up now? This question was quickly answered the moment I clicked play. It is no wonder why the series continues to be such a hit well into its years of its original air-date. ""Grey's Anatomy"" pilots its series with a group of medical interns who befriend each other at Seattle Grace Hospital in Washington. The main character, Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), seems to have some inner-confliction and constantly trying to please her mother, who is an acclaimed ex-doctor and the equivalent to Beyoncé in the medicine world. Meredith immediately clicks with hard-core, overachieving, aspiring surgeon Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh). Soon after, lovable George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) and optimistic Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) move into Meredith's childhood home as her roommates. The formulating group also includes Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), who doesn't seem all too happy to be there but somehow always sticks around. All the while, relationships begin to take shape amongst the interns and attendees, the first being between Meredith and Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), who is also known as ""McSteamy"" throughout the hospital.The acting is great and proves to have very little to complain about. Oh hits the nail right on the head as she portrays Cristina as perfectly unpleasant at times but somehow you still want to be her best friend. Knight as George O'Malley depicts the character's struggle with his vulnerability exceptionally and Chambers makes you love and hate him all at the same time, which is precisely what makes Alex such a stick-out character. While the vast majority of acting is phenomenal, sometimes the story lines and characters are not up to par. Pompeo is charming and adorable but Meredith is increasingly frustrating, it seems the writers are constantly hitting her character with waves of bad luck (I'll refrain from spoiling anything). Consequently, every time Pompeo's lip quivers and tears begin to well up you can't help but think, ""Again?"" Since the series focuses on different patients and different cases every episode, it is easy just to jump to a random episode and have a general understanding of what is going on. This is convenient for a viewer who may not want to start from the beginning but over time, it becomes impersonal. While the sexual relations and friendships carry through from episode to episode, the constantly changing dynamics within Seattle Grace makes for an inconsistent flow throughout. This may not bother someone who is watching one episode a week. Their thoughts and feelings that were aroused during the last episode are separated from this week's episode by a full seven days. While for the most recent flood of ""Grey's"" junkies, this variation in tone is somewhat aggravating while watching episodes back-to-back. For instance, one episode may focus on a patient that is fighting a tragic terminal illness and the next episode focuses more on the personal lives of the doctors, making it more light hearted. Though the touches of comic relief and knowing the characters' personal lives like the back of our hands adds cushion to some sensitive subjects, ""Grey's Anatomy"" is a true drama. As the episodes pile up, so does the tension. There may be some technical flaws here and there. Being an intern in a hospital is not that glamorous or as eventful as many doctors to attest to. Most interns barely get to scrub in on surgeries while Meredith and her colleagues cut someone's chest open practically every other day. ""Grey's Anatomy"" actually made me consider being a surgeon is not all that bad, only for a split-second though. Another minor flaw, it seems unlikely that that many good looking people would all be in acquaintance and work within the same establishment. But hey, it's television. Despite its minor faults, ""Grey's Anatomy"" was not worth my skepticism but definitely worth my time, no matter how many hours I spend binge watching on Netflix. It's a perfect guilty- pleasure show due to its outstanding addictive abilities and its lack of realistic situations, plus its unfathomably attractive cast. From any perspective, the series is a sure crowd-pleaser with just the right amount surgery and sex."
0	I seem to remember this being a medical show with medical procedures/situations. Now just a cheesy soap opera.
1	"Netflix's adaptation has turned into a quintessential American TV series. Tired of the typical ""bookish"" genre, I was initially delighted by the change, only to find it to be just another mediocre American show. In this series, the character Zhi Zi resembles a supercomputer, capable of enveloping the entire Earth. However, in reality, Zhi Zi disrupts astronomical/physical observational phenomena, instilling a deeper fear in scientists-the fear of the unknown energy rather than the fear of established scientific prowess.This portrayal not only showcases the fear of the unknown but also highlights the unsettling notion that our understanding of the universe may be fragile in the face of such disruptive forces. It challenges the very fabric of our scientific certainty, plunging characters and viewers alike into a realm of existential dread."
1	Ive followed this show for years and years. It's highly addictive and became one of my comfort shows. I rewatched all of it and finally having watched the latest episodes I've got to say that I'm surprised. Yes, there are a lot of new characters but it seems like a new beginning since Meredith is gone now. I love that Owen, Teddy, Link, Bailey and Webber are still there. I live for that drama and this show is a good example of good story telling. It's got it all. Not to mention the music. The choice of songs is incredible. And I'm rooting for Dr. Skywalker. LIKE YESSS.I'm very curious and interested in how this new season will continue. Very happy with it so far!
0	I once gave this series rave reviews. It wasy favorite show on Television ever!! Season 8 has completely ruined this series for me. Lazy writing and a rush to finish is what this season turned out to be. D&D should never have a serious writing job again!!!
1	The entire series is very well written, casted , acted and produced , BUT .....I'm afraid virtually everything that happens to this guy throughout the entire series he pretty much bought on himself.Any normal sensible person could see what was going to happen from the very beginning and would have run a mile.Both sick abnormal individuals that he got involved with were clearly red lighted at the very start of his meeting them ..... but he still chose to continue on multiple occasions.I still sympathise with what ultimately happened to him, but how stupid was he?!?Silly .... SILLY man 😔 😟The entire series would have been so much more effective if he was a totally innocent person who did nothing wrong and yet this had all still happened to him.With 100% sympathy for the victim this would have been an awesome series.
2	I enjoyed this tremendously and look forward to the next season. I have read the book and loved it, and have been concerned that it would be very hard to put on screen, especially in 8 episodes. But they did a great job. There are many changes from the book. The show is centered in London. Some characters have been westernized and there is more relationship drama. Some plot points have been dropped and others added. These changes are reasonable, though some worked and some didn't. Overall though excellent job. I do think it will be hard to understand a lot of things without reading the book but not impossible if you pay attention.Benedict Wong is excellent as are John Bradley, Zine Tseng, Liam Cunningham, Alex Sharp and Jess HongMy criticisms are: the Auggie character is poorly written. Eiza Gonzalez is very bad in the role and grating. She almost ruins the show. The motivations of the cult people are not well explained. The show slows down in the middle with the Alex drama and all the relationship stuff and some of that time could have been used for more expository stuff and providing backstory as in the first few episodes. The early episodes were paced brilliantly.I have not read the second book. I started it and found it confusing. I will try again.
2	This is one of the best TV shows everrr All the medical drama and the love stories Make sure that you have some tissues around Trust me you will need it
2	I love Grey, I really do, Grey has been through my whole teenage life, this show is part of me. But i have to say that after season 12, everything seems so messy. I don't know why, maybe it's because they tried to get Meredith into a new relationship or they kicked off great characters like Calie, Arizona and April, this show is just not the same now. The latest episode that I really love is Mama Tried and that's season 12. Season 13 is a total mess and has no storyline. Season 14 focuses on Owen and Amelia. (The only episode I loved from that season is Personal Jesus) And now season 15 is all about Jo. I guess I just miss the old school Grey.
2	"Earlier today I finished watching an eight-episode series Ripley (Netflix, 2024). Did it in just two sittings. All eight hours of it. A testament to one of two things: (1) an engrossing storyline; or (2) I don't get out much. In fairness, it's probably a bit of both.On a personal note, all three screen adaptations of the 1955 crime thriller novel by Patricia Highsmith, The Talented Mr. Ripley, involved the actors I simply adore; hence my interest in the piece:1. Plein soleil (Purple Moon), filmed in 1960, starring Alain Delon (his big-screen debut);2. The Talented Mr. Ripley, released in 1999, starring Jude Law alongside Matt Damon; and3. Ripley, dropped by Netflix several days ago, starring Dakota Fanning in what seems like her first adult role (although she was more impactful as a child actor).In all three ""incarnations"" the set-up is quite similar. The victim - Dickie - a rich 20-something American expat has lost any zest for life and is trying to rediscover himself by getting immersed in the Italian culture, painting, architecture, language, etc., as stimuli of sorts. The villain - Tom - does not come from money and clearly does not belong in Dickie's circles. But his persistence, cunning, and staunch desire to attain this craved class transition make him more of a protagonist, rather than the villain.The 2024 version was filmed entirely in Italy (including Naples, Rome, Palermo, San Remo, and Venice) and features some of the greatest songs of the era, including the classic Il Cielo In Una Stanza by Mina (when in a couple of hundred years they introduce a university course on the anthology of European 20th-century pop ballads, this would be the reference song. It would also appear that the producers working on this recording had just discovered the reverb effect and clearly went to town with it. But the song is still lovely).8 out of 10 (9, if you like Caravaggio; 9.5, if you like both Caravaggio and Mina)."
0	I am starting to avoid tv shows that are affected by some public movements and minority agression. The 3d season is a complete mess.
2	I simply love this show. I love the fact that it takes place in my hometown of Seattle, Washington. Beautiful city with lots of places to see and do. I love the drama and all the actors and actresses as well as the writers. They keep me begging for more and more insight into their personal lifes. If i were only 30 years younger this show would inspire me to go into being a surgeon. There are plenty of role models on here and I hope the writer keeps up the good work with developing the characters. From Meredith to Derek; to Bailey and Chief and Owen and Christina; and now the drama with April and Jackson weddings galore and Callie and Arizona are my favorite couple on the show. You just can't help but tune in to see what happens every Thursday night. There is plenty of wrecking balls for everyone. You'll just have to tune in to see it for yourself. Warning though this show Grey's Anatomy does have a tendency to become addicting -- you'll love every minute of it. Here's to Shonda Rhimes and her pick of wonderful, colorful, and dynamic acting from a diverse group of stars!
0	This show could of been Great! The cast is really good the actors are really good but the writers just couldn't help themselves they have to push a political agenda. America is heavily divided and to push away half of your viewers is just foolish! Not only that it's the viewers who support and back law enforcement! So many good shows are doing this and it makes Zero sense! I love Nathan but I'm done with this show and all it's Wokeness!!!
1	"...before watching this series. I admit, I have read the book and therefore have a preconcieved opinion. The parts that is about the chinese in the 60s is pretty accurate and follows the heart of the book, but the other things is heavily massacred with so called ""inclusion"" (that usually is written in the contracts before anyone can make anything) that pretty much always breaks immersion on everything where it appears.I think I could live with that sign of the times if I hadnt read the book since that policy is implemented in everything nowadays. The book concentrates on the story, not to please people on what once was twitter.Thank god Benidoff and Weiss didnt have to bow for that ""propaganda"" when they created Game of Thrones. Unfortunately they had to adapt and by doing so they missed their opportunity to make another ground breaking show."
1	This show started slow, but it grew on you. Throughout the series you get invested in the story, and have some explosive (literally) moments that are thrilling! These big moments were unexpected so it was a treat every time they occurred. As the show headed towards season 7, you can tell the directing got a tad lazy, but it was still fun to watch. Then season 8 happened. Cinematography? Great. Story? Meh. There are some moments that have you confused. For example: Dany forgot about Euron's fleet? Grey worm teleports to where Dany is? The castle falls on Jamie and Cersei, which kills them, yet Tyrion can walk to their bodies? The lighting of the long night? Ultimately, Game of Thrones is still a fantastic show. It is a shame that the final season only had six episodes, and was rushed.
1	"The Three-Body Problem is one of my favorite sci-fi novels. I first read the trilogy 11 years ago during middle school, and it left me so shocked that I couldn't sleep at night. Over the years, there have been many adaptations of this novel, all of which have been controversial and somewhat disappointing in various aspects. Because of this, I had high hopes for Netflix's adaptation. Unfortunately, after watching the series this weekend on a trip, I can only say that my feelings are mixed, but I still recommend it.It's difficult to regard Netflix's ""3 Body Problem"" as the same entity as the novel, just as it's hard to consider Apple's version of ""Foundation"" as ""The Foundation Series."" If you're expecting something on the level of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, you're likely to find that it feels more like ""The Rings of Power"" instead. With a shell and some settings from the book, it drastically simplifies technology, logic, characters, and even the sociology and anthropology of power, individuals, and societies, opting instead for a timeless love story.From the perspective of the original work, I am greatly disappointed. However, when I think about it, it is, after all, a Netflix sci-fi series with good visual effects (in some parts), a tight plot, and innovative settings from ""The Three-Body Problem."" It's accessible for the average viewer and not bad by any means. If you haven't read the original book, this series will definitely be very interesting, and I hope it might inspire some interest in reading the original.I'm not a purist for the original work and I believe that adaptations should differ from the novel, but how to make these choices and how to present the essence of the novel in a different form is a question Denis Villeneuve answered in a unique way through what he left unsaid, but not what Benioff and Weiss has done in oversimplifying the plots and relationships."
0	My advice: first read the books and we'll see if you give it more than 4 stars. I don't think so... This is one of the best fantasy saga I've ever read. Can't say that about series - sorry. It's shallow and boring with no attention to the details, plain and simple. Nudity & gore is not enough to keep mature audience entertained. It's good for teenagers though. If you're true fan of the books - stay out of it! If you haven't read the books yet - do it now and learn the difference. I truly wanted this to be a great series, but it's not. Period. Saying it's true masterpiece and the best series of all times is just ludicrous and immature, unless you have no expectations at all.
2	"Amazing series. I did not know what to expect but ended up binge watching the entire series in one go.I did not see the twist coming, I thought it was just a ""normal"" stalking movie. Richard Gunn did a fantastic job at telling his story. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry and it makes you uncomfortable.The characters were insanely good and you could tell that he spent a lot of time hiring the right actors. Martha was crazy!The layers and layers of trauma were presented so well, each and every one, I did not see coming. How can one person live such a life in such a short amount of years?"
2	"Don't listen to the fanboy gatekeepers. This show wasn't perfect but it was awesome, and i expected far worse.Anybody with a brain knows it takes more than 1-2 episodes to have character development. Main character was likable, without being overpowered. Her luck stats were just high.She wasn't a Mary sue. She was the main character, the ""player character."" She starts off in basically a brainwashing cult, of course she's going to be naive. She grows and becomes more real. And remember it's only the first season, it takes time for people to change and break old habits.And god forbid a female actually have a sexual side without being criticized for it. I don't think it was necessary, but it was hardly interfering with the plot. I wasn't a fan of the romance aspect. But that's fine.That being said, max was awful. I kept rooting for him to die. I don't want redemption. They started his characters development far too late, and he's a psychopath.And of course everybody's favorite, Cooper. I could watch a whole show that just follows him around. He was such a fun morally gray character who was an over the top badass in the best ways. And I can't wait to see what they have in store for him. Give me the 200 years of backstory in a spinoff please.Lots of fun little Easter eggs and nods to the show, and actually having Matt berry show up was amazing."
1	I think this version of the Ripley story is more faithful to the book, but there is a lot in this series that simply copies the Anthony Minghella film from 1999. The way some of the scenes are shot are direct copies from the earlier film. The stairway view during the murder of Freddie, for example.Before I started watching the series, I had some major reservations about it from the trailer. I thought Tom and Dickie were too old for their characters, and I thought the black and white seemed too film school affectation. Black & White equals deep and thoughtful. Got it. I more or less was able to put both of these doubts behind me as I started watching, but I can't help but think that the series could have been better in color and with young lead actors.Why would Dickie's father care what his middle-aged son was up to? That ship has sailed, to put it politely.What is with the director and stairs? For a good portion of the series, we're forced to watch people walk up and down stairs. Elevators aren't working, porters can't be found, and so we go up and down and up and down. I'm sure there is symbolism in all this, but I don't care to figure it out as I'm too exhausted. As far as the photography, it mostly gets in the way instead of telling the story. It's too much like being forced to watch your neighbor's vacation slides.And how much of this series was spent showing Tom walking around? Walking up and down stairs? Being scrutinized by a hotel clerk? Answer: way too much.The sparse use of story made eight episodes unnecessary.Tom and the inspector were good, but none of the other actors took command of their roles. Freddie? What was that? For one thing, he-she-it wasn't in it long enough for us to care one way or other about the character where Philip Seymor Hoffman stole the show in the 1999 film. Marge? Ugh. Dickie? Weak, at best and he couldn't be murdered out of the movie fast enough for me.
2	"Very good freshman season for this show, based on true events, although I doubt the real guy faced this many bullets in his whole career, much less during his ""boot"" time! (I realize they do this for drama, people, just being funny!!)Great show, good writing, Nathan Fillion does a wonderful job allowing his genuine & warm self thru into this character.It's not your typical police procedural, and that's what's great about it.It's as much a subtle & witty comedy as it is a drama.It can get a little cheesy & predictable, but it's fun. They aren't serving us caviar, they are serving us grilled cheeses with nice warm soup on a snowy, raw day. Makes ya feel all warm & fuzzy inside.There is sexual, professional & personal tensions so the subplots keep the show from being stale & they aren't overused - well, most aren't - & they keep the show's gaps filled so we can care about our heroes in blue - and it works (but I am over the ""boot"" hazing at this point...even though I know it's a big part of it, especially in the fabled LAPD & I assume it will last the entirety of season 1, w/ exception of maybe last episode or 2).Now, go enjoy this fantastic show."
0	The story is naive and completely divorced from the original. Political correctness in the cloak of science fiction.The universe shines, ordinary people can't see it with the naked eye, but 3D eyeglassesAs the only one among billions of people, make an appointment every day.Be serious, okay?At the core of the story, China people create disasters and mexican american saves the world.Are you kidding?.What is the director afraid of? Or do you not understand Chinese?Xswl, I bet there can't be a second season. The plot is too rubbish. Anyone who has read the original will refuse to watch it a second time.
1	So I am almost through season 10 and I have to say that up till season 9 it was pretty great but due to the events in season 8 where some characters died. The new cast that is introduced in season 9 is no where near as interesting and neither is the actors. But the show is still watchable just not as enjoyable.
0	This is one show which would've benefited by being shot on location. The unmistakable evergreen forests of Canada immediately breaks a sense of immersion.The story feels low stakes, with boring subplots and meandering political machinations. Two ridiculous scenes in the pilot would give Tarantino an orgasm. A group of Japanese soldiers are almost overcome by a starving, weak pirate and in the same scene one of the said soldier has his sword taken from him by one of the weakened pirates. They had diversity behind the camera but still played the Western fantasy of overcoming Eastern might with ease.The show will probably do gangbuster numbers for the first few episodes but interest will fall if they don't pick up the slack. The characters at this stage are too thin, especially the Japanese who come across as one-dimensional and, in some cases, caricatures.
1	After I finished the first 4 episodes, I wanted to rate this show 9/10. As a fan of the books, I don't mind all the crazy changes, and I appreciated simplicity which makes it easy to understand.BUT, after episode 5, the pacing has changed. Episode 6, 7 and 8 are mostly dialogues and many of them are insignificant, boring and bad written! It feels like I'm watching a different show.I just don't understand why they have to cut off so many important info and many of the characters became boring and flat. Why can't they spend more time on Dr. Ye and Detective. Da Shi? Da Shi is so boring and useless in this show with no personality.
1	I have enjoyed this show since the beginning, and was sad to see some of the actors had to leave the show but that's TV. However in the beginning in my opinion the stories were crisp and well written and believeable. I really like the relationships between the characters and that tackled serious issues with a just a touch of humor. I enjoyed this show so much that i would always watch on the following day after the firts broadcast so i can watch it on streaming because i get to skip commercials. Lately though i have been skipping episodes, because I find the stories lacking. One of my pet peeves is the relationship between Chen and Bradford I don't see it, there is no chemistry and they don't gell. And Nolans relationship, nada!! In Castle it was better!!! And the stories are just not as compelliing.
0	Lazy writing trying to capitalize on the defund the police movement. Won't be watching it any more. I can just turn on CNN for same level of lowbrow entertainment.
0	As a longtime fan of the books, my expectations for this adaptation were high. However, I found that Saul and Auggie's portrayals significantly detracted from the series. Their characters seemed unnecessary and were particularly grating, which often pulled me out of the story. For example, Saul's constant pessimism didn't seem to add to the plot and could have been moderated for a more balanced character. Auggie's overly sarcastic tone and constant emotional instability felt out of place compared to the source material. If these characters had been either omitted or written with more depth and less annoyance, in a more realistic manner, the series could have been an 8 out of 10. Despite this, the adaptation did have its strengths, such as following the overall events of the series. By refining these characters, or just sticking to the source material, the series could better capture the essence of the beloved books.
1	After two very interesting episodes, this series completely derailed imo. Too rushed, big holes in the script. This was a big letdown in the end. Examples of what annoyed me (spoilers here!): With such advanced technology, the San-Ti could've disrupted much more than they did;The Panama canal scene: they really thought shredding the whole ship was the best solution? The shredding should have caused explosions and they couldn't have known it would prevent destroying the harddiscs with information;How on earth could 300 nuclear bombs be put in space in 2024 the way they did? There was no explanation at all and that felt rushed and not credible since humanity only has a couple of worthy spacecrafts in 2024;The nuclear explosions were very close to the vessel and sail. Another thing that you should take for granted as a viewer, although it was again implausible.I could go on and on. The acting was good, visually it was great, but what promised to be a fantastic tale, ended up being a bad representation of that tale.
0	This show started out great. In reality, I kind of lived it. Unfortunately, by the most recent season, it left reality and entered the twilight zone. Patrol officers doing everything except patrol and including politics. When they start toting political philosophies in law enforcement that have already been tried and failed miserably, it's time for this show to go away. Unfortunately, it's now hurting good actor's careers.
0	Season 3 is trash with all it's woke messages dominating the show. Why cant we just be entertained anymore with good stories and acting??? Why does everything have to send a social message anymore? When September 11th occurred, most of Hollywood TV/Movies ignored it like it never happened...very few even touched it with a ten foot pole. However, George Floyd/BLM must dominate every police show now??? Both are tragic events, but I dont believe it must be the messaging in every cop show forever and ever. Another example is the covid pandemic...very few shows right now even acknowledge being shot during it, like it hasn't happened, no masks/no mention of it. I really dont understand why one storyline must dominate our entertainment??? I am for shows OCCASIONALLY exploring social issues (an episode here or there). I hoped season 4 would start fresh, but I had to turn it off as this show apparently has reached the ridiculous point already. It's such as shame as I love Nathan Fillion. His work, especially Castle is typically top notch. But I dont think even he can salvage this show.
1	The show has become a victim of its own premise. When Fillion's character was a rookie in seasons one and two, it worked as he was fish out of water. Now he's no longer a rookie he is a very bland cop with a smug charm with little of dramatic interest in his character. The other characters who surround him - Bradford, Chen, Grey, Lopez - have far more interesting back stories and are potentially much more interesting in terms of their ongoing conflicts between their upbringing/beliefs and their roles as cops . But the show's premise now sidelines them as they revolve around the jolly Nolan whose story arc has run it's course.
2	"This is a police drama that has a sprinkling of humour to keep a semi light tone through most of the episodes.This makes it quite an easy watch, the characters are well done and the plots are normally pretty good.However, it has some episodes that are so bad I feel they are unwatchable.To date we have: two terrible ""documentary"" episodes and last weeks was some nonsense about hacking in an episode that started with a significantly better tone.I don't think it would be harsh to say the bad episodes feel like they were part of someone's school project. Why did the producers make a second documentary episode when the first one received by far the lowest rating of any episode?"
1	I enjoy this show. It's a fairly light-hearted police dramedy that is believable, but doesn't take itself as seriously as other cop drama's like Chicago PD, SVU or Blue Bloods, which I kind of appreciate. The acting is overall pretty good and the characters are likeable. Last season was the strongest season and had the strongest storyline with the serial killer so I wish they would have dragged that out to more episodes. Not as strong as Castle, but still a win for Nathan Fillion.
2	Baby Reindeer is one of the most compelling, thought provoking and genuinely insightful pieces of TV I have seen. But it's also really entertaining.Creator and actor Richard Gadd pulls no punches in dissecting his own autobiographical story, going warts and all into some very dark and challenging places. But he also tells it in a way that remains upbeat, often funny and consistently engaging.It's rare that a male character is allowed to be as psychologically stripped bare as Donny is. But it's unique to see a man dealing with abuse, sexuality, masculinity and self-doubt in a way that is not preachy, depressing, patronising or fake.The cast are all excellent. Jessica Gunning, who plays Martha, is a complete revelation. I hope we get to see a lot more of her in future shows. Nava Mau really glows in her role, and her contribution to the story is so well done.This is a series that will stay with me for a long time. So happy to have seen it.I am amused by those reviewers asking for a second season though. What more do you want this poor guy to go through?
1	... and then it lost me.Perhaps I wasn't paying close enough attention through the first three episodes to see what lay ahead? Or perhaps it's not a faithful adaptation of the novel(s) and the showrunners were engaged in some dastardly tomfoolery? Or perhaps the author knew at some point we'd be on a camping trip and run out of kindling and didn't want to saddle us with endless regret?Remember when Henry Winkler looked cool jumping a 🦈?This show is a stark reminder that not everyone should attempt jumping 🦈 🦈 🦈.Rosalind Chao was on M. A. S. H.?Bears.Beets.Battlestar Galactica.Michael...
2	A Great remake of The Talented Mr Ripley movie but you can't beat the original. Matt Damon is exceptional and makes the movie what it is. Jude Law was great eye candy lolI think Gywenth Paltrow also does a much better job of Character Margo and I dont understand why they made Freddie's character a female actress playing a male? I must've missed the reason why coz she was clearly female lol the hair & suits didn't fool anyone lolHowever, Andrew Scott does a phenomenal job too, great actor. Thoroughly enjoyed this Netflix mini series!! Anyone who hasn't yet seen the original movie, it is an absolute MUST!! 9/10.
1	First two series were a great combination of entertainment with some serious highs and lows.... Third series seems to be going for an undertone of lecturing us on the moral rights and wrongs that are topical right now....
1	It's time to stop do not destroy a great series with stupid time filling episodes
0	Season 1 and 2 were entertaining, but Season 3 has become too preachy; the cast overacts and their dialogue is dismal. It seems to have become a soap opera and a bad one at that. I'm not interested any longer.
0	Was a huge fan, rewatched every season, spent hours watching fan theories on youtube, was heavily invested in the show....Its actually devastating to see something that I loved so much get absolutely destroyed. I dont even understand how they managed to make it so bad.... what was once a thrilling and unpredictable series has become a hollywood marvel inspired show. Wish i could hop in a time machine and not watch s8.
0	I was looking forward to this, something that promised to be an interesting take on hard-science what iffery. Not having read the books, I don't have any axe to grind with how good or not the adaption is - I just want to be entertained with compelling characters, interesting ideas, and just maybe a Netflix show that delivers on its promise.What we have here is a failure to communicate anything of substance. Catwalk pretty scientists allude to wikisearch results with all the depth of a Mr Men episode - simply referencing the existence of hard science does not make it that kind of show. Good looking young people ramp their expositional acting all the way up to 3 by way of first-take it'll-do directing. It really does not help with the dialogue has everyone talk with the same voice; there is no nuance between any of the characters, except Liam Cunningham who drops the C bomb every so often because he's Irish and that worked well for him in GoT.Anyway: somewhere out there, there are God like beings far more advanced than we can imagine. They are coming. They may get here sooner than Jesus, they may not. Hopefully both arrive at the same time and there's a proper religion V science kick-off. Neither can come soon enough if this show is any barometer of the smarts humanity allegedly possesses.Rich people want to be best positioned to take advantage, and will do whatever it takes to make that happen while creating more plot-holes per minute than any other show in living memory.The special effects are Dr Whovian, circa 2005.That's pretty much it.Enjoy.
0	A tedious, stretched out remake no one asked for, with baffling production choices. I don't know how 'true' to the source material this version of Ripley is, but it is certainly different from the film version and not for the better. This is shot in black & white for no reason at all. Why this digital, CRISPY looking black & white? This does absolutely NOTHING to enhance the story. This is a solid F on all levels: Failure of casting (the entire ensemble feel so disjointed and out of place) failure of directing, poorly paced. Just rewatch the Matt Damon version and call it a day. This was not it.
1	Has the world been brainwashed? Where are all these 10/10 reviews coming from. It's got to be the U. S. Anyone who is from the UK knows that no one talks like the main character and never has. He is cringeworthy every time he opens his mouth. It's an embarrassment how Americans feel they have to portray English. I promise you- no one sounds like that.The characters are OK'ish- it's not like Game of Thrones were some of the characters are absolutely vile- it's all a bit tepid.The fighting scenes are predictably fake. You know the type- can you 30 bad guys form an orderly queue to kill the one lady with a stick please?It reminds me of a family friendly Disney programme- wait. What? Ah, may be it's aimed at kids then. That would make more sense.
0	Great series shows are my entertainment. When the show tries to ram politics down my throat, I can move on to something entertaining. In the past several years, I've watched show after show fail, once they start trying to make a political statement....just look at the awards' shows! Grey's Anatomy has had a great run but they should have left the news to the news shows.Bye-bye gang. I'll miss you.
0	Good amount of action, and Nolan is a good man. An example of what any cop should strive to be.However all other characters insist civilians are all crimainal or one step away from being one, while the cops are all self-righteous and imperious to any wrong doing, mortally, ethically or legally.Dont waste your time on this program.
1	Great characters in the beginning and the longer you go on the more insufferable and awful the characters and actors get. I wouldn't go behind season 7 with the exception of the Denzel Washington directed in season 12 ep 9. One of the best eps ever!!!
2	"As a Chinese audience who has read the novel ""Three Body Problem"" more than three times during high school, I must applaud Netflix's efforts. It's not because it restores the magnificent imagination in the novel, nor because its special effects and performances are amazing, but because it uses a sufficiently simplified form to allow every ordinary foreigner who has not read the Three Body Problem novel to understand the charm of this masterpiece, even if it is only a small part.In China, criticism of Netflix's ""Three Body Problem"" series focuses on its highly simplified and adapted character relationships and images. For audiences who are familiar with the original work (such as myself), this is indeed somewhat difficult to accept, not because of insufficient performance, but because of the deviation between the character image and the expression in the book. When Dune 2 was released, I also heard fans of Dune novels expressing dissatisfaction with Villeneuve's adaptation in the movie, but this did not prevent me from enjoying the Dune series and buying back the novel to read - this is the most important role that an IP series should play, allowing the IP audience to continuously spread to the outside world and attract more viewers. The Chinese TV series ""The Three Body Problem"" undoubtedly excels in restoring characters and scenery much better than Netflix, but its extensive efforts in restoring novels - I cannot bear to criticize - have made the series very long and sluggish. Apart from fans, no one likes to watch a few people chatting in the same room for thirty minutes. My parents persisted for ten minutes, and I persisted for eight episodes. The data does not lie. The Chinese TV series ""Three Body Problem"", which was launched on China Central Television and mainstream streaming media networks, saw a drop in viewership to only hover around 1% in the middle stage. Considering the great efforts of the creators, this cannot be said to be a huge failure. That's also why I have such a high tolerance for Netflix's ""Three Body Problem"" series - it's shallow, simple, and even somewhat flattering, but it makes ordinary audiences watch it, and that's its victory, that's the cruel mass media.In Journey to the West, Sun Wukong did not worship a turtle as his teacher, nor did he have a divine dragon and seven dragon balls that could fulfill human wishes. However, this did not prevent Mr. Akira Toriyama from creating the great Dragon Ball comic, and more people searched for ancient Chinese classics because of it. I hope Netflix's ""Three Body Problem"" can have the same effect and attract more foreign friends to appreciate our excellent science fiction works in China. ""Three Body Problem"" contains Eastern people's thoughts on human destiny and nature, which may not be correct, but in a certain direction.Love comes from China for you."
1	The COVID episodes went on way too long.> The non-Covid storylines involved: politics racism racist attacks racial profiling women's rights LGBTQ people marching people fighting Unprovoked attacks horrible dirty cops... ..jeezus ENOUGH ALREADY > I couldn't take any more. It's the first time since the show started- forever ago- that I didn't like it.> People watch tv and movies to relax and escape from the daily b.s. Of the world.>Give me back my O. G. Grey's, or end it, that's the only two options.
2	I really wanted to rate GOT a 10 but the last season was such a disappointment i couldn't. The problem with the last season is the writing there are lots of plots that either get ignored or a unsatisfying conclusion. Also some of the character arch's just seem stupid in the last season. However the first 7 seasons are contain some of the best writing and visuals that TV has to offer. No character on this show is safe and main characters get killed off all the time. I would defiantly recommend watching the first 7 seasons of this show and then maybe make up your own ending because it will almost definitely be better than the actual ending.
0	Season 1 and Season 2 were good. I don't know what happened in season 3. It was not entertaining anymore.There is too much wokeness in season 2. Giving message is okay but it cannot become whole show. What a waste!
0	The actor who plays Blackthorne in Shogun is terrible. Also, poor writing lets down the show. Once the naval crew is captured, they can't act like bosses. The most logical thing should have been to be respectful and stay calm. Since that time, Japan was trading with Europeans its highly unlikely that they wanted to kill the crew without validating their cause.Additionally, the writing struggles to maintain momentum after the initial capture, with the plot lacking depth and the characters falling into predictable archetypes.Also lack of respect to Portuguese language is a major concern. In positive note, costumes and inertial design are up to the standard. Also they use Japanese as primary language which is obvious thing to do.
1	Basically what I said in the title. Love the first 6 seasons, the 7th was a decision but okay, and the 8th was just flat out bad. Disappointing end to once great show.
1	This show was addicting, and I watch a few seasons. But I just could not handle the absolutely stupidity of the characters any longer. Stupid is forever. Ignorance can be fixed. They are all stupid. So, I stopped watching it.
1	It started out great in season 1, became a bit over the top in season 2 with rookies being involved in major crimes every day, then season 3 became a social lecture in race relations, gender issues, socio economic concerns, and other touchy feely stuff.I'm not against having these issues as center pieces in TV shows. Honestly, it's the only way American adults are educated these days, but c'mon. Let them just be cops for an episode or two.
2	Every single scene and thing serves a purpose here. You may argue that sometimes it feels too deliberate, but compared to many other films which simply put things together, thoughtlessly, this deliberateness is a plus.For some reason, the English-speaking characters, apart from Ripley - the real Greenleaf, Marge and Freddie - are less savory compared to the Italian ones? I'm not sure why (passivity - sensing Ripley is crooked but not doing anything? Hypocrisy? Nepo babies?), maybe it's intended that way, maybe it's the aura of self-importance.And the Italian cast, like Inspector Ravini (Maurizio Lombardi) left as big an imprint, if not more, as characters like the real Greenleaf, so in my opinion they should be given equal credit and accolades... even though, historically speaking, I know only the anglophones will be properly mentioned and remembered.
2	"If you're a fan of Liu Cixin's book, you'd appreciate the accurate thrill and fear of aliens, not only their plight, issues and the familiarity of another life form's struggle. But also lays bare the threat of the ""Dark Forest"" theory which outlines the potential danger of a highly advanced species finding out about a less primitive species.Much like how European colonizers treated less advanced people's they came across by oppressing and wiping them out. This point is also brought out by how we treat bugs or less intelligent species on our own planet, we never bat and eye about killing cockroaches or flies everyday, which is a perfect metaphor for how the aliens view us.Lastly not to reveal too much, I'm glad they tried to follow real science as much as possible."
2	I have to say I've really enjoyed The Rookie even more than I though I would. I've been a Nathan Fillan fan since Castle and he really shines here. He stars as John Nolan, a 40-something year rookie for the LAPD. After a life altering incident he chooses to pursue his dream of becoming a police officer. As the oldest rookie he has to persuade skeptics that he's cut out for the job and that this isn't some mid life crisis. These are several supporting characters in this and they all bring a sense of entertainment to the show. It's a really easy show to sit back and watch and even have on as background viewing. It's one of the better cop shows of the last few years.
0	Plus an actor in a leading role who never really learned acting (at least it seems like this).
0	This show is melodrama at its lowest and most manipulative. It rises to the level of a middling soap opera, but never above it. The voiceover narration is a stylistic choice I guess, but not a very good one since the narrator isn't very interesting or has anything interesting to say. I'm still early on in this blah blah blah and, reading all the one star review saying that it goes woke and political, I think I'll bail on this dreck now instead of investing any more time in it.
0	It started interesting but the plot deteriorated quickly. To name a few, 1. An entire high intelligence specie is invading earth because one in 7 billion people send them an invitation? I mean, what if no one answered, they would just die?2. We know for a fact and based on our basic technology that there is 40 billion planet like earth. Why a high intelligent species would choose a very problematic planet like earth.3. Since they monitor everything, they should know, by the time they arrive, we would have destroyed earth either by war, global warming ... etc. We are a self destructive specie, just give us time and we will do it for you.4. There is five known extinction on earth that wiped out life completely, how earth is still a viable option?5. A specie evolved in planet of three stars would definitely perish in a different environment. Humans are already struggling with few degrees increase of temperature due to global warming.6. If they were a high intelligence specie, they would have incited wars by recruiting agents and rest assure we will wipe ourselves out and earth will be ready for them when they arrive. By sending us warning, they actually united the human race against them and accelerated our development.7. Dont start with the lying thing. Even animals lies to hunt their preys. They claim to have studied our history, they should know better that our history was based on deception and lies since the beginning of time but they were shocked when they learn we lie from the red hood girl children story .. lol.8. The part where they refused to send swat team to infiltrate the oil tanker fearing a bloodbath but decide to use an unstable nano fiber technology to cut through the tanker killing everyone and destroying everything including the hard drives. The oil tanker was going to some harbor to fuel, it literally moves at a maximum speed of 30km per hour and it is in god damn canal !!! It is not going anywhere anytime soon. They had all the time in the world to plan their infiltration.9. The stupidest plan ever to send a spacecraft and accelerate it using 1000 explosives !!!!. Couldn't they just use planets gravity like voyager 1 and 2 to reach high speeds. And what was the purpose of it all ? They are already in communication with the alien race. Its like having a mandatory meeting at the office where was completely feasible via zoom.
1	"I was rating this show with 10 for the first 6 seasons. Than quality start to deteriorated. Season 8 episode 3, ""Long Night"" killed evil Dead King in dumb and rush manner, and the rest of show with him for me."
1	I have loved this show for years, even as each of the new characters became more annoying. This season is the worst and I am losing interest fast. Maggie's whining self-involvement ruins most scenes, Miranda's nasty personality, Richard's mopiness, Owen's self righteous attitude and Meredith's absence means there is no central character and frankly, nobody to like. I'm giving up on the show.
0	I've been with this show since the beginning; it was the best show I'd ever seen up until about season twelvish. Now, all these years later, they're just reusing old storylines on a new cast. Like it's some nighttime soap opera. And the way they had Meredith exit? THE SHOW HAS THE CHARACTER'S NAME IN IT. What a horrible send-off to the character the show's named after. Unfortunately I feel compelled to continue watching since I've been with the show for all this time, but it serves more as background noise than anything else. Do yourself a favor and carefully consider how much time you'll devote to binging this show if you've never seen it before, because it gets worse as the years go on. Maybe stop halfway through?
1	Arduously slow... Andrew Scott is ttoo old to be Tom Ripley...The only spot on casting was Dakota Fanning and Dickie's mom. The peripheral NYC and Italy casting were great.I really wanted to like this because I LOVED the books but , Good grief!!Skip this and watch the brilliant movie or reread the books.There are so many things that aren't good here. Unfortunately, they are not so bad, that it would be fun to watch... The cinematography great. As is the music... even the acting is top notch - it's just a giant yawn ESPECIALLY, if you've seen the movie or read the books.. The obsession with the elevator in Rome is beyond tiring as well as all the shots of the cat in the lobby.... Lucio, leave while you can ...
2	Always loved castle and so followed the rookie for nathan and dknr regret it
2	"It's nice to see a real sci fi show about science and ""what if,"" not just an adventure or horror movie with sci fi veneer. The plot had some real unexpected turns and original story elements. I also learned some history and science along the way.Some quibbles:It seemed illogical that in the later episodes the aliens just stopped blocking new tech, and that they didn't go after the people opposing them more.I felt episode 7 dragged a bit.I was disappointed the story it wasn't wrapped up in one season, but I don't know the books.I also have to take one point off for unnecessary R rated stuff - you can tell a story without showing awful things in detail of tons of f-words.But overall I enjoyed it, even if I had to use Vidangel with some additional fast forwarding over a couple slow parts or horrible parts."
0	The first 6 seasons are great but the horrible rush job to finish up the show screwed it up so bad for me. So sad i loved it but can't recommend any longer I dont want anyone else to be disappointed as much as i am. Nothing against the actors or the effects teams its all in the writing and directing.
0	Another show down the drain because of their hateful, intolerant, vile political agenda.
1	I never read the books, but I can already tell the amount of changes made to it to fit the taste of the western audience. I will say this though, the story is intriguing and the script well-adapted.However, I have issues with this adaptation, mainly what Hollywood unnecessarily dictates these days:--1 star for the almost total replacement of the Chinese elements.-1 star for the insistence of replacing all Chinese characters and replacing them with DEI people.-1 star for putting an Indian and a Chinese as a couple; in real life that is highly improbable.-1 star for not using better looking female lead.
0	Very boring and pretentious. Lots of light flaring on lenses, I guess this is supposed to be atmospheric. If you took a few classes on photography, you'd soon find it's largely considered amateurish. The music is louder than the dialogue making it difficult to understand anything. Seriously, it's not that hard to balance the audio levels. Complete fail. It's a mish mash of history & fantasy, sorry but that's what it is. Lots of sub titles, why? When Europeans speak, it's modern English so why bother with Japanese. So pretentious. Pick a language & stick with it. It's either a Japanese film or an English film... NEVER both!The costumes etc are great. I'd prefer consistency to nice costumes & sets but who cares about that these days. Better to be pretentious and pseudo multicultural.So, if you are looking for some pretentious crap, this is the one for you.
2	I've never been in love with a TV show before GOT, and it totally ruined other tv shows for me. It is the best thing to have happened to television, and it set benchmark for other tv shows. Unfortunately, towards the end, the show's quality dropped in so many unexpected and unforgivable ways. It is easily the Best Tv Show ever, if not for the the last two seasons. If you are new, and can't decide whether to watch it or not, I'd suggest give it a try. GOT has got his moments. You'll totally love it but yes, the last couple of seasons will disappoint you. But as a wise man said, It's not the destination it's the glory of the ride!!
2	"Firstly I rarely give anything more than an 8, this was 9 from me. This is one review that I don't want even a hint of a spoiler in, so I'm going to do my best to review without giving any of the story away because it's that good. I started this completely blind, because it's a rainy Saturday at home, and it was new on Netflix. I'm so happy I did because it was a great series. So good that I not only binged it but watched it without ever checking my phone or getting distracted by anything else. The pace is great, keeps you not only interested but just as you think you know what's happening, you're surprised again and again. Sometimes heartbreaking surprises, sometimes heartwarming surprises.This is not a typical ""stalker"" movie, it's so much more, that it is a disservice calling it that. It has so much depth from all the characters. Yet all the fat is trimmed, so it just makes the characters more complex but keeps the plot going.I really wasn't prepared for the diverse emotions from utter loneliness all the way to unconditional love and anything in between like anger, trauma etc. People are created by our experiences and where we take those experiences and what we choose to do with them. Maybe because I now know it's based on a true story that these people are so well developed and multifaceted. The acting is superb! It's a richly rewarding watch. I'm so glad I randomly chose to spend this rainy day with such a great find. I highly recommend!!"
1	First of all I didn't read the book so I will review what I saw without caring for the difference with the book. I really like it but there were some things in the last episodes that made me gave it a 7.Spoilers!!!!!What I didn't like: the fact that Greenleaf's girlfriend was too stupidthe inspector who at first seemed very intelligent it ends being a moroon. For example the scene where Ripley was disguised very poorly, the fact that he never asked for a picture of Greenleaf, the fact that the witness told him practically that Ripley carried an unconscious Freddie to the car exactly at the time of his death and didn't arrest him immediately. He didn't even asked the owner of the place what happened that night she could have told him that she heard a big noise on the stairs like someone carrying something heavy lol.and most importantly why they didn't informed USA embassy that 2 Americans are missing and one is dead.if the inspector would have checked Ripley prints he would have found out he was seek by the police in USA which again I think even in that period when prints system was quite ok and Interpol existed since 1920 WTH? They could at least have called NYPD.Yep there are many dumb things but overall was enjoyable.
0	I happened upon this series in season 1 Episode 1 and was hooked from S1-S4. This is a fantastic show rich with character growth and unforgettable world building. The introduction of magic & prophecies had me skeptical but the rich story and top notch acting kept me engaged.As the show grew, as did production values - yet still, even in seasons 5 & 6, the roots of the original 4 seasons showed through and still delivered good character interaction.However by season 5, the source material has dried up and the 'showrunners' must produce by cliffnotes. This is when dialogue turns to ash in your mouth and great leaps are made in storytelling to get characters where they need to be for the next plot point.By seasons 7 & 8 the show is clearly leapfrogging its way to the end game - making major plot compromises to create the conflict and storyline they are looking for.While the books remain to be published and redeem this storyline, perhaps providing some sensible storytelling - this show is amongst one of the most poorly concluded series of all time.
1	Her bug crazy bug eyes and yelling all the time ruins it, leave Shawn Ashmore alone, he's way too good for you. Now she's a super hormonal super cop mommy, barf, too involved in the story line. Why couldn't you have killed her off instead?
2	"What a show, it had everything. The story slowly clicks into place and you want, no, need to know more. This serie had my full attention, something not many series seem to achieve since I have my mobile phone to distract me. I love how the world is built I love how the characters don't play the cliche ""ohhh you lied to me now we can't be friends lines."" It was a journey, a great one and I long for more. Seems to be that series inspired by or made from videogames are a new wellgoing trend.I defintately would reccomend it, it makes you think how much power the people who rule us really have. And how much power money actually has."
1	"This show is entertaining and suprisingly wholesome. And no, season 3 isn't ""too woke"" or ""agenda""..... if this is too woke for you, you have some issues.. a show about the police without touching the topic of racism would be a joke, cmon guys, are you serious?"
2	Visually brilliant. Excellent acting. And of course, James Clavell's fabulous story as a basis. The acting is top notch across the board, but particular praise needs to be given to Hiroyuki Sanada.BUT....As an old man born in the Far East, of course I've read most of James Clavell's books. I also watched the 1980 version with Richard Chamberlain and Toshiro Mifune. And whilst as a spectacle this version is better (21st century production standards and technology, of course), at the point of writing (episode 3) this production falls short of true greatness. Why? Simply because they have rushed the story. The promotion of Blackthorn to Hatamoto, for example, appears out of nowhere. Blackthorn's respect for Toranaga seems to appear out of nowhere.
0	This show hasn't been that great since they killed off Barristan Selmy.It kind of exemplifies how the writers care more about satisfying the 'shock value crowd' with surprise character deaths, than maintaining character consistency or interesting dialogue. Whether it be a close up of a penis with warts, the half dead Mountain raping a nun, or an Ed Sheeran cameo, the show is just kinda 'meh' now.
1	The previews of this tell an autobiographical story of how an unsuspecting bar tender named Donny (Richard Gadd) fells somewhat sorry for an overweight, older woman who comes into his bar crying. He's nice to her and she instantly bonds to him in an unhealthy way. Ito goes on for quite some time before he reports it. The lag in time for his reporting is explained in the series so I won't go into it here.The things I liked about it.1. The acting of the leads. Richard Gadd was ok, but Jessica Gunning carried the movie.2. The first 4 episodes were good, then it sort of went from a dark comedy to just dark.3. I haven't seen someting quite like this before 4. The ending and not in a sarcastic way, it ended kind of nicely for me.The things I didn't like.1. The character of Donny. He makes stupid decisions and then when whines about why his life sucks. Hello!2. The actress who played Teri wasn't a very good actress.3. This didn't need to be a mini-series. The whole story could have been told in an hour and a half movie.If you're a member of the LGBTQ+ or a woman or identify as a woman, you may like this story better than those not in any of those communities. It's definitely not a family series so don't invite the kids.
0	When Grey's Anatomy first started it was a entertaining and enjoyable show. Over the last few years they have been interjecting politics and far left views into the show. This is another example of a good show that went woke.
1	This is my Favourite show ever, it makes the person forget every single thing in his life and makes him think all the time about what will happen in the next episode .I'm kind of people that hate medical shows whatever it was, it makes me hate everything in my body believe me or not ,but this show change every single thing in my life ,before this show comes out I never set against the T.V screen to watch a Drama series more 15 minutes ,because I thought it's so boring and useless.This show is really change my ideas about the drama series.Most of the times you think that nothing can change what you believe in ,I know it's so hard to do it and it makes you sometimes confuse ,but for the people around you and the people who you like Give It A Shot. Excellent acting from the cast with a beautiful stories and drama makes this show remembered by a lot of people.Love relationships with Shock endings like what happened in the end of season 1 between Patrick Dempsey and Ellen Pompeo,Justin Chambers and Katherine Heigl in the beginning of season 2 ,and between Sandra Oh and Isaiah Washington in season 3,and others happened in the 4 seasons.In my opinion, Grey's Anatomy is the best show in the century,so make a change and watch it ,because it worth it !Overall Score: 9.6/10
0	This is not fallout world. This is the Care Bears world. Characters without charisma. A colorful world not apocalyptic. The story is boring. Steel brother armors are made of polystyrene. LoL. Nothing is realistic. Everything is bland. Tasteless. This a serie created with the name fallout and fallout character, but not in the philosophy of a real fallout world. Not think for the old fans who made fallout known in the world.only references to fallout 4. As if bethesda wants to send a message (fallout 1, 2, new vegas do not exist). The pip boy it is also in polystyrene. This a fake world not apocalyptic world.
1	It goes without saying I suppose that the series is beautiful to watch. The acting is solid but the story and some characters are badly flawed. The largest gaping hole it seems to me is the San-Ti travel time vs Human's progress. The San-Ti are apparently much more advanced than humans but somehow, now that they have escaped their destructive world, their progress will go into stasis. Wut? Also, despite the fact that our entire world has looming extermination in our sights a few scientists have trouble disposing of the San-Ti's cohort here on Earth. Wut? There are other holes too that are irritating but you get the idea. If you want to watch a good movie (only an hour and a half long!) about quantum mechanics check out Coherence. It's far more advanced in science than 3 Body Problem.
2	Fallout was one of my first games ever and played every single one of them, i'm huge fanboy too and i can't believe those fanatics giving low ratings lol. I was expecting something worse to be honest but other than some minor setbacks that can surely be ignored, even newcomers can really enjoy this fun show. Yes for the newcomers this universe has a lot to take in and in the first glance it can be really really overwhelming and the show does not make a good job to ease you in, it does it later on but they should have just start with 'war, war never changes' and explain the state of the world for the viewers to digest it in. After a few episodes it really explains a lot expecially about the vault tec and the political, social, ethical spects about the universe but for an 8 episode series they should have done the explaining in 15 minutes and jump into the action. It's so goofy and cheesy and it doesnt take itself seriously like the games, acting is great even though i was prepared to hate Lucy but i didn't lol. Goggins is delight to watch as always, Maximus is an amazing character with a plenty of room to grow. Music is unbelievable, designs are Oscar worthy, great production really captures the life in the vaults but it comes a little bit short when it comes to westlands but it will become better in S2 i hope. Screw the fanatic fanboys really just enjoy this beauty..
1	This series is based on the game of the same name. I didn't play the game and the series was exciting and fun for me. The series shows the future when the world has been destroyed due to nuclear wars and the majority of its population has been destroyed and only a part of the earth's population who were previously in special shelters have been saved. The story starts with a certain excitement and this excitement continues throughout the story. The characterization of the main actors is done well. The struggle between the survivors for survival is well and excitingly shown. The future of the earth with these people will be very terrible.
2	This show was ...like awsome, i don't know what to say, all the emotions i felt throughout this cannot be put properly into words. From from the petty to the empathy to the disgust or to the thriving rage, the moment with his dad legit made me almost tear up, and i got so freaking mad when he went back to the writer , his breakdown was like super emotional i couldnt take my eyes off the screen, the dude who wrote this is just to good, i wish he and tara stayed together tough. Overall it was just amazing, and oh my god the way i hated Martha, im gon a like make everyone i know watch this i binged it in 1 day.
2	Seasons 1 to 6 were brilliant. Please remake season 7 and 8
1	Everything is great. The Japanese actors, the production design, the camera work (except for the missing lighting crew!) etc., but who picked the actor who plays Blackthorne? He is not up to the task and ruins this great show. This acting capabilities can much anyone around him. Not charismatic at all makes it hard to follow his story while everything else is just well executed. Sometimes good cast can lift up a show, here it does the opposite! Plus nobody believes that a character like Mariko falls in love with a character like Blackthorne. Absolutely no chemistry. Everything is great.

1	"Season 1 of The Rookie was some of the best police procedural of all time, both in terms of technical details and as entertainment. Since then it has been going downhill.The show used to be about -+ Struggles of a 40-year-old who had a midlife crisis and became a cop.+ The sharp contrast in attitude of a person who has attained maturity outside of the system compared to regular cops.+ Authentic (by TV show standards) nitty-gritty of police work and training, both good and bad.+ The massive impact on a newly minted cop of killing someone in the line of duty.+ Flawed relatable characters trying to do their best.+ Impact of a cop's job on their personal life.Now it is about -X Insufferable Mary Sue characters that have replaced many of the more complex and relatable original roster. Even characters originally worth rooting for like Lopez and Harper, have become insufferable and a distraction from the core subject matter.X Cops mowing down bad guys like 90s action heroes or video game characters. Completely bonkers off the rails nonsense like shootout in the desert, patrol cops (including a rookie) practically conducting CIA black ops on foreign soil.X Family drama and romantic comedy.X Detectives Cagney and Lacey having babies every few episodes. I mean, I am fine with them having babies, but does it have to involve a major story event every time?X The Fire Department, which apparently has only one insufferable employee assigned to every 911 call. From Sarah Shahi to Ali Larter to this one. What a downgrade, for Nolan and for the viewers.X Psychics.X The ""Dim and Juicy"" stuff.... It genuinely feels like a parody of the police procedural that this show used to be.The show is in danger of going from The Wire to Police Academy. My request to showrunners (not that anyone will care) is to cut down the rom-com family drama and go back to what made the first season so incredible. I understand and appreciate the need for characters to grow, but the show itself should maintains its original spirit and scope. Otherwise, it is bait and switch. Like, if Nolan has another epiphany and decided to join beauty school like he once joked, is that going to be new subject of the show?"
0	Disgusting use of extreme graphic violence that does not necessarily serve the plot. Hard to watch, I felt nauseous in the middle of the first episode and stopped watching it.It's like ruining a good restaurant dish with copious amounts of hot pepper and salt, a reasonable person wouldn't be able to enjoy it unless their senses are so dulled by past exposure to a great deal of violent content. In my opinion, it would have been possible to convey the same plot even without injecting quantities of fake blood at the very beginning. If you have a sensitive stomach, save yourself from watching this series.
1	Started excellently and got better but completely baffled by the final season. So much time and effort put into creating and building interesting and exciting characters only to see their stories end in the most unimaginable ways. If you've not watched game of thrones I would definitely recommend it but be prepared to be somewhat confused by the lackluster ending.
2	I used to love Grey's, I binged the first seasons multiple times and it was my favorite drama, but I stopped watch it a few seasons ago, my favorite carachters are basically dead and I don't think it's the Grey's I used to love anymore, maybe it's time to giving it a decent series finale and move on. I definitely recommend the first seasons, I loved 1/5 seasons, seasons 6/8 were okay I guess but then it started to get worse and worse.
1	The first 8 seasons are great, but then it slowly starts to get boring and way too repetitive, and I just don't care about the characters anymore. Literally the only reason I see some new episodes every now and then is to discover new songs, because the soundtrack is the only thing that continues to be awesome.
1	I never thought another show could replace Lord of the Rings or Breaking Bad as my favorite shows ever. However, GoT quickly replaced them and has been my greatest addiction ever since. And it is because I love(d)this show so much that it literally pains me to see how catastrophically they have botched and butchered its final season. It began with the Battle of Winterfell, and the show has been in a tailspin ever since. Others have already elaborated the reasons for why that is. I just think it very sad to so poorly end what had been such a great show for 7 seasons. I will not degrade my Seasons 1 through 7 Blu-Rays collection with those from this final season. They're not something I'd enjoy rewatching as I have the others...
2	"If art is meant to provoke, challenge your preconceived ideas, and make you think, this series is the definition of it. I can't remember the last time I was so moved, fascinated, horrified and uncomfortable watching a series. It was hard to watch and yet I couldn't look away. I turned it off at one point... but half an hour later went back to finish it. The events were presented in a way that made you question your own biases, choices, and preconceived beliefs about what you think constitutes a stalker, a victim, about the confusion and shame of people struggling with their sexual identity, as well as the dynamics of sexual coercion and men's mental health which is so often ridiculed and minimized. When it came time to rate it I couldn't decide between ""not for me"" and ""loved it."" As soon as I finished the series I had to get out of my head for a while and went for a hike but literally couldn't stop thinking about the show. I simultaneously want to watch it again - and also NEVER watch it again. Raw, vulnerable and shocking: it's art in every sense of the word."
2	Bar the final season and maybe S7, everything was amazing about this show. The cast, the story lines, the MUSIC. Ramin Djawadi is a genius. But at the end of the day, season 8 was horrible, and that's what will be remembered about GoT.
2	The series is quite good, it perfectly conveys the atmosphere. For those who played the game should like it. I love the post-apocalypse theme. There are not many films on this topic. What disappointed me was the casting for the role of Maximus. Where did they even find this actor? He's pretty uninteresting and uncharismatic, and he's mad throughout the series. The rest of the actors are well chosen. The soundtrack is cool. It's a pity that there are not many episodes, I would like more. Hopefully there will be many seasons and not many years to wait. Nuclear Coca-Cola to all. After the series, you will want to play the game again.
1	The sets and the vibe do a great job at capturing the essence of Fallout. The ghoul and Norm are carrying the show on their back in my opinion. The show has some great scenes. But there is room for improvement with writing, directing, acting and actor choices.A major gripe of mine is the pacing in many scenes. For example (one of many), the scene in episode eight between Lucy and her dad where he is asking her to go home with him, lasted way too long. We get it, she's devastated and isn't sure what to do. But the scene didn't need to be dragged out to get that point across. These awkwardly long scenes can cost the dramatic effect they are trying to achieve. Also timing between dialog and characters were bungled from time to time. For instance; all of Thaddeus's dialog felt awkward and it seemed as if the actor hasn't performed a day in his life. It was immersion breaking.Another immersion breaking constant was Aaron Moten (Maximus). This main character is given the least amount of backstory in this season and his character comes off childish and inept, in turn his scenes with Lucy and other character's are off putting. As if the actor is deciding scene to scene how he's going to play his character and it comes across as lacking consistency. I was unable to tell if Aaron is just a bad actor or the show needs better directors.Fight scenes were clunky at times, The injected humor in scenes didn't come across the way I think the show intended. But I can let that slide.However, overall I feel they did a good job and would like to see where they go in Season 2.
2	Having seen all the screen versions of the Ripley saga I think this was outstanding. Not many films or series work in black and white these days but the camera work and production result in an absolutely authentic work that shows Italy in a very different way.An excellent series based on the original gripping story which is more atmospheric than the earlier versions imo. Andrew Scott and Dakota Fanning are brilliant and the casting throughout is very good. It's one episode too long I think as it can drag in places but overall I'd highly recommend it and will watch it again at some point.A nice little nod to the past in having John Malkovich appear in the final episode.
0	"The concept of a mature, successful, blue-collar man reinventing himself as an urban police officer is an interesting concept for a movie, or even a miniseries. But, when he makes it past being a ""boot"", it becomes just another by-the-numbers cop show. And that's where ""The Rookie"" has stagnated since it's first season. So it's writers and producers have had to resort to improbable situations and romances to pad the script. And there are, of course, lots of thinly-veiled but profound messages regarding ""equity"", ""diversity"", and ""inclusion"". And then they tied it in to a show about an overweight, black, female FBI agent...! Give me a break!"
2	If you're a fan of the Fallout video game series, you'll likely enjoy this series and eagerly anticipate its continuation after watching. However, for those unfamiliar with the Fallout games, their reaction might be uncertain, as certain aspects may not be fully understood. It's recommended they approach it as a sci-fi or cyberpunk series. Despite being episodic, the first episode captivated me, leading to a binge-watch of the entire series. The storyline progressively improves, and the main characters are very engaging. Fans of conspiracy theories may find this series particularly appealing as I did.
2	Greatly disappointed in the last two seasons. Last season was freaking waste of time.
0	"***SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT***I'm reading the first book and I'm about 200 pages in, so all of this plot is still very fresh in my mind for what I just saw on Episode 1. I don't understand why this show has such high reviews...perhaps the obscene amounts of gore and nudity? I only watched Episode 1 of Season 1 and that is all I will watch, for reasons I will make known below. Before that, I would like to state that this series may reflect the book, but it taints the reputation of the book and the reflection is not accurate in the least bit.Characters: First of all, the ages of all the children are older than in the books...which I'm assuming will make nudity of the girls...more acceptable to the audience??? Jon Snow is not at ALL what I pictured him to be...I mean it gives a physical description of him in the book...so there's no excuse for that. However, most other characters do look a lot like I would have imagined (esp. Arya and Ned), just not Jon.When the show began it completely butchered the scene of the Night Watch men who encountered the Others. The wildlings on the ground were not butchered and the man who deserted after the encounter only survived because he climbed up a tree. I know that seems like a small deviation, but for a series that claims to be so close to the book, the opening scene was screwed up. The execution of the deserter was handled well, but what about Bran's big question? Following the execution, the dire wolves scene was mishandled as well. The actor playing Jon did not look as though he was caught off guard by finding the runt. Speaking of that, all of the plot was rushed much too much. The actors failed at capturing the nuances, pauses, and facial expressions that these characters make. I was frustrated throughout the whole episode because it seemed to rush to the nudity, which is FAR LESS IMPORTANT than, say, the scene where Ned and Robert were underground paying respects to the dead. That scene deserved more than it was given. They didn't bring Robert and Ned's relationship to life, instead they make Robert look like a man-whore and they made him look soft (as in fat is whole life). The king should be hardened, but with a softness that only Ned can bring out in him...Mark Addy is NOT Robert Baratheon. No, no, no. I'm so mad at myself for watching this because now all of the faces of the characters will be associated with the actors...Boo!The sex scene with the Imp and all of the whores was completely fabricated...I mean that was just completely unnecessary. So many people are stating that this series handles sex maturely, but it takes something sacred and makes it absolutely disgusting. The book did not handle sex this way at all! Also, Daenerys is supposed to be a 13 year old virgin and the show had the actress who played her take part in two obscenely long nude scenes. I'm sorry (not really), but that actress does not act very innocent or afraid and I don't think she can because she is too willing to pull her drawers down. The sex scene between her and Drogo was not handled well either because it made Drogo seem way more barbaric than he actually is in the book (according to that specific scene in the book). They didn't have time to throw in the fact that he tenderly asked her for permission? I mean, really? That scene in the book ended in mutual agreement...(well as much as possible considering the circumstances). Now, the sex scene of Cersai and her brother was pretty much dead on for the book...I will admit that much. Pros: The costumes, props, and scenery are somewhat nice. That's it. You can't build up a show on nice backdrops and cool clothing though. Overall impression:-The necessary scenes were rushed. -Important details were completely neglected. -Some characters are all wrong and the ages of the children are fudged. -Sex has devolved into a barbaric act of overpowering women. -Most of the nudity is unnecessary and is OVERWHELMINGLY uneven (all full-on naked women) -Props and scenery are nice. -Whorehouse scene completely fabricated.PLEASE READ THE BOOK. You'll understand why so many of the people who read the book are angry. Now I'm off to read the book some more, but I think I've made it quite obvious that this show has dragged down my overall ""A Game of Thrones"" experience. I don't even know if I'll finish it now, but I definitely won't be back to watch this ridiculous adaptation of it.Last words: The actress playing Daenerys is so beyond wrong. I actually feel bad for the made-up character in the book!BLEH! >:("
2	It was a great viewing experience if you exclude the last season.
2	I'll be the first to admit that I was expecting a let down. Especially with Hollywood's recent track record of going ballistic on any IP they get their hands on.This then being a video-game adaptation, which are usually ranging from utter failure to let downs, the stage was set to this being just another one of the bunch.But apparently someone's been doing their homework, because they actually managed to create a pretty decent story in the Fallout lore, and also deliver a visually authentic experience to go hand in hand with the writing.Now this isn't the greatest show ever conceived by all means, but what it set out to deliver, it delivered it well.All the actors had done great job with their roles, special shout out to Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins as the stand-outs.The music was absolutely spot on, simply due to them being literally ripped out of the games, so the nostalgia hits any fan instantly.And last but not least, to avoid spoilers, the show full of a vault worth easter eggs for the fans to find.If they can keep this momentum and attention to detail for a few more seasons, this could actually go down as the best video-game adaptation to date.
2	Game of Thrones Where should one start? I can basically say that the series is well done. Great acting and casting.However, I must say that it can seem a bit long-winded. But if you keep watching the series, you will feel joy, and pain, and frustration.1 good thing about Game of Thrones is that the series goes almost like the real world, except for Dragons, which makes you mysteriously love dragons like that after a while.I'm a big fan of the characters, the way all the younger actors and older actors grow with age.I am especially a fan of the execution of effects and the music that is played together.I definitely also thought that the history and execution of the forged weapons, such as swords, daggers and axes/hammers, plus also has a great effect on the story and the character.The series is a must see, if you are a fan of fantasy and magical creatures.
0	It starts OK, quite interesting at the beginning, degrades to bad, uninteresting, even banal very fast. At some point it doesn't even make sense anymore, it's just jiberis and clichés and special effects.I'm sure they could have done a better job out of the base material.It gets 4 stars only because I think some of the actors play their roles very well.I guess that unexpectedly killing some of your main characters doesn't always lead to a good show.And, BTW, I don't think it's OK to brutally kill children, or anyone for that matter, just because they happen to believe in aliens, as the creators of this show seem to believe.
0	Really poor writing,clichéd plots and characters that are so bad at acting it's untrue....add entry of BLM garbage and you've got the most woke show on TV.Season 4 finale was the worst episode of a lot of bad episodes, the whole time and dim thing was so bad the show is becoming unwatchable...I've had enough of Bailey being in every branch of the services there is and the annoying FBI woman but this takes the biscuit unfortunately judging by John Nolans belly and moobs he's taking more than just the one biscuit...
0	Politics and agenda! This is very awful! You just became an agent for this agenda!
0	I rarely take the time to write a review, but this was so bad despite all the positive reviews it's getting, I just had to present a different point of view.The main character is a victim, true, but he pretty much has it coming to him for indulging someone who's obviously deranged. He might have the excuse of past trauma, but even that was partially his fault for getting high and getting himself into a situation to be abused.I still have two episodes left to watch and I'm only going to watch them because I dislike leaving things unfinished, but this was a complete waste of my time and I really hope that no one else gets tricked into investing their precious time in watching this absolute abomination of a series.
0	One is a bad person who relies on betrayal, theft, and gambling in life, and the other is a lucky girl whose brain is controlled by hormones. The excessively disgusting male and female protagonists make people indifferent to their future development, and thus the entire drama is not worth caring about. To put it bluntly, that dog is more charming than the male and female protagonists. Not to mention the disgusting plot and setting, abandoning the plot of Fallout New Vegas and declaring Fallout 4 as the victory of the Brotherhood, a militaristic organization. But it has to be said that B's fans are really loyal, halo is fiercely criticized, radiation is praised, humorous.
0	"Imagine spending hundreds of millions of dollars and man hours to adapt a world wide best selling book. And then treating the music and score as an afterthought. The ""theme"" that plays in the opening and in every episode sounds like the composer forgot to write the score and had AI do it the night before.Do you realize how many composers would KILL to write music for an end of the world, science heavy sci fi show? The possibilities are endless. The theme should be haunting, yet captivating. And it bored me to tears everytime.Also the plot holes are endless and so easy to point out. Especially with the Wallfacer program.1.) If you're trying to keep your plan of world planetary defense secret, maybe DONT announce to the entire world who the 3 people chosen are 2.) We've already seen.the Sofons are capable of entering your mind and placing images in your head. It would be so incredibly easy to kill people at will. Saul could have a million soldiers protecting him, what could they do to stop an invisible force capable of getting in your mind?3.) If the aliens want to kill humanity, they could literally do it with the Sofons. Literally kill all power to the world. All communication. That'll kill half of us in 5 years. Then release every poison gas to kill the rest. There's a million ways they could do it 4.) Why was Eliza Gonzalez's character so bent out of shape over destroying that boat? Those people literally want to bring about the extinction of the human race. And are responsible for bringing them here in the first place. Surely she is smart enough to know 6 billion is greater than 100.They never gave proper motivation to why the ""Judgment day"" people wanted the San-Ti's to come. They're aware they would likely wipe us out. Constantly saying ""They will save us from ourselves"" makes no sense. What does that mean?"
2	"I think the producers made a mistake in going monochrome with this series. I often like black and white films and shows from the early years of TV and cinema. Those were lit with that in mind. It does not work for this show.Italy of the era was meant to be beautiful and had a reputation for magical light. The characters talk about the beauty compared to New York. So why miss it out. This is not a radio show.The pace is very slow at first. Almost travelogue speed. The dialogue would have done a lot of cutting. Too many silences in the conversations as if they are meant to mean something. I kept wanting to shout ""get on with it""That said.... Silence... Once it gets going this a thrilling ride. Scott is great as Ripley. For such an unlikable character, I was rooting for him. Dakota Fanning was OK.Moritzo Lombardi as the Inspector in Rome was stunning to watch. Elliot Sumner brought a whole new character to Freddie Miled."
2	From epic to a trash... a master series turn to a joke.. d & d destroy the saga
0	"The sci-fi elements are not primary, not secondary, not tertiary but quaternary to the plot.The primary element of the show is melodrama, poorly acted ESG-friendly melodrama. The vast majority of actors are rigid and diverse, except in China. In the Chinese settings they are portrayed to be Chinese and convey some emotions, but in the British settings they are portrayed to be ""diverse"" with the applicable current-day tropes.What else is there: rigid acting, long stares, nihilism and magic thinking.The story in itself makes no sense, no civilization would have flourished to reach the stage of interstellar travel on an unstable planet subject to pseudo-random cataclysms.If such a civilization could achieve interstellar travel, which requires them to travel 400 years, they should be able to seed the universe with a myriad of ships. The same myriad we were showed they would invade earth with.As for a chinese traitor being able to move freely on her own without repercussion on a top secret base in communist china and doom a whole planet on a few words... then recruiting followers to create a doomsday cult. Well, it's just fantasy.If the aliens are capable of some elements of mind control and control cameras on land but not satellites, then it makes no sense they would not have probed the minds of the population. So the reaction of the ""lord"" makes no sense.Let's also pass on the concept of the VR headset, ridiculous. There's more garbage in there like the converted tanker with an unprotected satellite dish, or the magical nanofibers that can cut anything without sustaining any damage. The scenes following the chopping of the ship are ridiculous on so many levels, better not think about it if you intend to like this type of production.This show is really tedious to watch."
0	"Fallout (S01, 8eps, 45-min, Amzn Prime) is a video game adaptation apparently, never played it, so my review isn't dependent on that. I wanted to like this, I came to it with eager eyes. And yet, once again, Amazon Studios continues their onslaught of cultural re-engineering instead of producing quality, independent entertainment. This is another mighty-woman first series that will appeal to 5% of a cry-baby population and turn-off the 95% that should be enjoying it. The first episode was just so ridiculously stupid in too many ways to count including the stupid '50s musical soundtrack that was so displaced I thought I was imagining it. So I thought, alright, that's a throwaway episode, maybe the second will be better. No. Now add to all that crud, racial retribution, and even more incongruent 50s musicalia. I am SOOOOO tired of ""progressive"" studios absolutely ruining entertainment! I don't even want a new tv anymore! I'm watching less and less because of all this @#@#@# they're throwing at us!"
2	It's a pretty great show no doubt but the women in this show, you will hate them for sure.Everything else is great except for this one particular recurring thing.The women, firstly it's Ye, she does something that jeopardizes the entire world and virtually dooms the future generation and somehow she is the victim and somehow she did it foe the greater good.Then Jin, she is basically responsible for the death of her best friend and yet she doesn't even stop or show any remorse in her actions to keep going, it's like she is desperate for some purpose.Then Auggie, where do I even begin with this one, yeash, she is responsible for the death of a 1000 people and she acts like she is concerned or cares but still she has all the power to stop it but she won't and soon after she wants to act like she cares and tries to blame some guy who knows exactly his mission and juat doing his job, from the moment her character gets the spotlight, she is just a roller coaster of hypocrisyThe women characters in this show do the most heavy wait but they also are responsible for the problems create from the beginning, and yet we must endure their hypocrisy and ridiculousness.
2	Game of Thrones is undoubtly the biggest TV show project to it's date. It has the quality of a blockbuster movie FX, CGI and acting-wise, and even a better scenario and story telling because it's based on a very well-written books series, A Song of Ice and Fire.But everything changed after the show catched up to the book series it's based on, and producers started to write their own scenario. The quality of writing gradually declined after season 5 when this happened and hit rock bottom at the and of the show. The ending was terrificily dissapointing for most of the fans, and made literally no sense in my own opinion.It could be a show worth of 9 or even 10. But last seasons made the show a cliche-hub and even ridicilous sometimes. I'm sorry for the wasted opportunity.
2	"I haven't read the original book (now it's on my reading list). I haven't watched the Tencent adaptation. I understand it's dumbed down, ""streamlined"", and given a ""General Tso's chicken treatment"".It is still good though. The world-building is great, the cinematography is spectacular, the plot is engaging. The explanation of scientific ideas and concepts is easy to digest even to the audience not familiar with them.The scientist bunch, however... Dear scriptwriters, it's 2024. The general consensus today is that the scientists and nerds are not all insecure super geniuses who insert the F-word in every sentence to sound cool. (Thanks for not calling them ""boffins"" though.) The cast is OK but there is not much for them to play with.The cast that is given less cardboard characters like Rosalind Chao, Liam Cunningham, and in particular, Benedict Wong really shine. Especially Benedict Wong with his grizzled, chain-smoking cynical detective whom every other character unsuccessfully tries to provoke. Give this man a medal.Worth watching and I welcome the trend of adapting classic sci fi instead of dragging infinite decade-long franchises."
2	I'm currently re-watching this on Stan from the first season and it's even better the second time.
2	Although the series starts with a very good tempo at the beginning, it connects a lot after a certain time, and the change of the cast reduces the interest in looking at the screen. Still, I don't know how much it would be right to criticize the series, which has watched countless seasons and so many episodes. DETAIL: Since the tempo of relationship triangles is very supportive to a certain extent in the functioning of the series, a great deficiency begins when the squad changes. Then I think the biggest problem is that mass injuries, adrenaline in the hospital is missing, and the biggest shortcomings and worst intrigues do not suit the series so well that they drive people away and cause the series to end after all these seasons.
1	The build up through the first 4-5 episodes lines this series up for a great tale that leaves one expecting more than it delivers.The story relies on flashbacks and jumps to present to build a very good narrative. This narrative builds to a few interesting twists and flashpoints that becomes slower towards the ending episodes.Some epic and stunning scenes however make this a worthwhile watch. Casting is very good, performances are believable and the entire story leaves one hoping to see more of this story to be made by the end.Definitely a great Sci Fi offering mixed with mystery and fantasy with a dose of factual and even historical context. *(referencing the WOW! Signal, and starting during the cultural revolution in China).Obviously targeted towards nerds and sci fi geeks with heavy references to Nano tech, particle physics and astronomical science fields interwoven with dimensional theoretic research and Virtual reality gaming. Well made and at times intensely interesting, while having long moments of slow dialogue. Overall worth a 7/10.
1	This is supposed to be a medical show like House, St Elsewhere, Trapper John , Etc. But it is really a soap opera based on the intertwined love affairs of all the resident and intern doctors who just are so horny they love each other long time.They constantly compromise each others lives by having unprofessional and unwise relationships that would make most alley cats jealous. The very first show starts the viewer down the path of unholy sex romps with our lovely starlet the harlot hooking up with a total stranger who quickly becomes her main fixation and unshakable love drug. The other cast members quickly fall in to the bed'em don't wed'em routine and this becomes a little too much of the focus.That being said, the show is still riveting with tremendous periods of intense drama that leaves you needing more, just like the sex starved cast members. The shoot from the hips diagnosis, and exploratory surgeries, are often a little under researched and casual compared to House and his crew's 58 minute workups. Still in many ways the show is more believable than House, and Merideth Grey is much easier to take in large doses than Greg House.The first two seasons are on DVD and I would recommend anyone wanting to give the show an honest chance, rent or buy them and start in order. There is a tremendous amount of character development that should not be missed.Despite my feelings about the loose sex and love interest, I think the show is a hit well worthy of all the accolades it has received. I also think the cast is about as talented as any show ever put together when you examine them as a whole.
0	"I have read only the first book, it is a work of art. I had not been so thrilled since I read Neuromancer back in '84. So, to the Nettflix series, fingers crossed, waiting, until I could watch it. I came with mixed expectations. After all, Netflix did a fairly good job with Altered Carbon, right? Ok NOOOOO... I am sorely dissapointed, to put it politely. Just no respect with the source material, it is not enough to keep some plot points, it is the overall concept, the beauty of the narration, the science, everything!. To convert it to a soap opear is just a capita sin. In a previous review I read ""Just enough changes to make it more digestible for a TV audience"". Translation: ""just dumbed down for a stupider audience"", like it is a good thing. Since when a TV audience is less intelligent than book readers? You are making a TV series, you have all the time in the world to explain everything! And of course, the mandatory changes in genders and races, so the appropiate equality quota is fulfilled. ""Men bad, women good"". PC trash again. I think we were lucky that this was not directed by Jerry Bruckheimer... Now, I have ZERO hopes for the upcoming Neuromancer adaptation in Apple+. Thanks for nothing, Netflix."
1	Excellent acting, very good story lines, almost as good as E.R.. Not as hyper nor hectic as theirs, which is why I thought I would like it. I've always liked medical dramas.However, these good story lines are muddled with so much sex I can't remember who slept with whom. If I thought for a minute that anyone carving me up was that distracted by their sex life, I'd find another surgeon. Thank goodness this is just TV and not reality.Add to that the director's decision to incorporate the most inane, distracting, really loud muzak in almost every scene and you have a show that really isn't worth watching. I can't hear the dialog for the muzak.Note to director: CUT THE MUZAK. If you'll just do that one thing I'll keep watching.
2	Being a huge fan of Castle/Nathan Fillion, I've looked forward to this show since the first commercial. My biggest worry is people will compare it to Castle and not give it a chance.None of these cop shows are realistic and are barely believable. They're just tv. Relax and enjoy the show. It's a good one. If you like this type of show (I do).
0	I stopped watching after the 10th season as it was getting boring repetitive. So many good characters left the show though they kept on going with Elien Pompeo who should have left and find something new to pursue her career. It could've been legendary if they stopped at the right moment of time.
2	Some Americans are complaining about the use of English to describe discussions in Portuguese. This is the norm for many period shows. English in an English accent is typically used.The show obviously needs to skip parts, but the tension is really described in both books much better, , Clavels Shogun and the original Pilot's Samurai William (a must read). Almost 500,000 Japanese had converted to Christianity and the Portuguese had been wrecking homogeneity of Japanese culture. Almost 30% of the Daimiyos had converted and had dual loyalties. They were causing havoc in Japan.In Samurai William the politics were even better described even between Spanish and Portuguese. The pope had given Japan to Portugal but the Spanish using the earlier Tordesilas treaty onsidered Japan theirs too.Lastly the show does miss the mastery of languages William/ John is described as knowing in the book. Fluent in English, Dutch, Portuguese and later mastery of Japanese.The acting of the Japanese characters is top notch , the European characters well seems to be a bit over the top.
2	The environment, characters, music - everything is there.It's hard to complain about the show, because it is essentially a fallout game moved to a Tv-show.Having said that, in a game I can have more patience with some parts of the storytelling not matching up to others. There is so much more to a game than the script that plays in.But in a Tv-show, it doesn't work to have part of the show feel unengaging or questionable at times. Every minute counts.The truth is that most of the time I am loving the show. Others I cringe, or want to skip, because frankly they aren't keeping my interest, or I'm not feeling the writing.So far it also lacks moments that are truly inspiring that will stay with me for years to come.It is a great addition to the latest trend of games turned shows being good. But it doesn't belong with the greats so far.A solid 8.
0	Seasons 1-4: 10/10. Incredible.Seasons 5-8: 1/1000. Only the DB twins could make me grateful that George is taking a decade to get the books done. They could have used that patience and attention to detail. George chose wrong when he selected showrunners.
2	Created by Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner and its cast includes Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, Walton Goggins, Kyle MacLachlan and Moises Arias.SynopsisBased on one of the most important video game sagas of all time, it is the story of the haves and the have-nots in a world where there is practically nothing left to have. 200 years after the apocalypse, the peaceful inhabitants of the luxury lodges are forced to return to the irradiated hell left behind by their ancestors and are shocked to discover that an incredibly complex, joyfully strange and very violent universe awaits them.If The Last Us gave us some hope that video game adaptations would finally manage to be faithful to their origin, today Amazon Studios is present with its spectacular adaptation of the popular game Fallout. The studio takes all the laurels under the eaves of its two creators, Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner, who faithfully and satisfactorily adapt this entire post-apocalyptic world that represents the complexity in which the entire story takes place after Fallout.A careful and well-thought-out work so as not to lose any of the blood that made the video game so popular, but also without forgetting that it is a television adaptation and that it must also capture a neutral audience. That work is done correctly where both fans of the game and viewers who connect with the story for the first time can enjoy a forceful, concise and well-written series, which makes you glued to the screen chapter after chapter without never lose the emotion of what we are seeing and the sensations that everything is increasing in satisfaction.The affection with which its creators take the series is essential for us to have a result that lives up to the satisfaction it generates. The dose with which they offer us humor, drama, war, survival and many more details in which the series surprises is a perfect cocktail to have a result that at times comes to surprise with its own ability to end up conquering known and unknown alike.Each chapter generates a successful journey through the action, social reflections and constant plot twists that in the hands of its inspired directors we obtain refined and notable entertainment from Amazon. The series is very intelligent when it comes to measuring each substance to be delivered so as not to exceed the formulas that end up turning the series into something meaningless. It is a series well measured in every detail and in each new option to be delivered, which means that it always remains even and never falters in pace, entertainment and emotion.A perfectly chosen cast where no one clashes and each one gives their stamp to their already popular characters. Having Walton Goggins with his Western attitude is the greatest possible pleasure, but also having a charming Ella Purnell as the great protagonist is also a delight, reflecting that her casting was totally a success in each of her performers.A series that clearly becomes one of the best so far in 2024 and without a doubt earns its place in the royalty of great video game adaptations to the small screen. Both the most fanatical and those looking for novelty will be totally pleased with a powerful proposal that makes use of their entire budget and their creative minds behind it. It is a series that you should see even if you do not know the game or are not a fan, because the series works from beginning to end with a forcefulness that does not give you room to doubt it at any moment and that is being faced with a great job that deserves to be appreciated by everyone.The Fallout universe is welcome to adaptation royalty.
2	I was more than happy to see a modern adaptation of the famous books by Patricia Highsmith. The 2 movies of the past can't complete these story and i hope that more cinematographers accept the challenge and adapt this wonderful character. The photography is superb, it makes you want to stop the tv and watch the scene, music is melancholic and moody, casting is very smart and performances are beautiful. For me, if you have read the books you know that Tom Ripley isn't queer but for some reason nowadays he HAS to be. The first movie chose to present Tom as a homosexual mostly because it lacked the patience and will to present correctly his infatuation with Dickie and now this series is flirting with the term 'queer', mentioned at least 35 times but I suppose it's ok because ...Netflix. Read the books if you liked this, the depth of this characters is beyond this presentation for 'modern audiences'.
1	This series had the potential to become something truly great by the end and open a new chapter in the world of television. Sadly, the eighth season completely ruined the whole series, including its characters, its world and its story.I won't mention any spoilers here, but if you really want to watch this series, be prepared for a gigantic disappointment at the journey's end. You'll watch one of the greatest series burn down in huge flames.If I have to rate each seasons individually, here's how I would rank them:Season 1-4: These are definitely the most complex, most layered seasons with the highest level of scriptwriting. Excellent dialogues, pacing, character developments, narrative twists, etc. Mainly because at this time the writer of the books was still involved in the making of the series and the series were heavily build upon the books. The absolute best is Season 4 because it had the best character interactions and story arcs and it also had some of the most memorable moments in the series.Season 5 is a mixed bag. It has the heavily disliked Dorne plotline and overall, most episodes in it while are okay, they don't move the story forward in any meaningful way, they often just feel like fillers. But at the same time, the last four episodes are extremely good and interesting, mainly Hardhome, which is arguably one of the best episodes in the series (and also my personal favourite along with the ninth episode of the sixth season).Season 6 is fantastic and in some ways, it's maybe the best along with Season 4. But it's hard to properly judge it, because despite some of its darker moments, it feels rather optimistic and uplifting, and maybe because of it, for some people, it won't really feel like Game of Thrones. But everything that happens in this season happens for a reason and everything is earned, twists and moments don't feel cheap or forced, they feel natural, there are no filler episodes and the overall pacing is great.Season 7 is a mixed bag, similarly to Season 5. One half of it is great, the other half is not so much. But as opposed to Season 5, in this case, the first half (first three episodes) are the good ones, and the later episodes are the bad ones. The first three episodes are very dialogue-heavy and character-centric and they feel very well written and satisfying, they feel a natural continuation of the story and quality of Season 6. But after that, the logic gets completely thrown out of the window, everything starts to happen so fast and basically, Game of Thrones' real downfall starts from here.Season 8 is a monumental disappointment. It subverts your expectations in the worst possible ways, things happen purely for shock value instead of happening because of the natural progression of the story. Character arcs get thrown completely out of the window, there are tons of deus ex machina moments, main characters wear plot armor and they are practically invincible. Things happen way too fast therefore there isn't enough time to really build up certain scenes in an intelligent and beleivable manner and scenes that are supposed evoke a certain feeling from the viewers (for example, sadness) evoke a totally different feeling instead (they make the viewers laugh). There are a lot of forced and artificial drama, the episodes are extremely inconsistent in a lot of ways, not just compared to the previous' seasons episodes, but compared only to other Season 8 episodes too. The biggest victim of Season 8 is Game of Thrones itself.
2	Not an exact copy of the book. The program has more space for the interpersonal relationships adding depth to the characters that together look like a scene from Friends.I also liked the scientific accuracy, the mix of fast and slow pace, and perhaps the most important of all is that they don't assume the viewer is stupid.On the downside there are a lot of graphic scenes, the alien (ai) behavior reminded me very much of behavior of people on the spectrum. And I feel insulted from the association with bad/evil/scare.This is a surprise because otherwise they have put so much effort to make the cast diverse.
0	It's incredibly confounding how such a run of the mill show -- that repeats and repeats and repeats the SAME, tired, storylines, and just combines them with different backstories -- has now been on for years and years and years.I give the writers some credit for getting away with this repetitive nonsense (hence the three stars) but still -- how can people waste YEARS of their lives watching this unoriginal pablum?I guess the answer can be found in some of the higher-rated reviews, where brain-dead viewers refer to the actor's characters by NAME, as if they're real people. Newflash, they're NOT.Reminds me of stories Larry Hagman used to tell, about how viewers of Dallas used to actually attack him in airports, asking him why he left SUE-ELLEN? :)Sigh...
0	I feel like everyone saw the feelings Lucy had for Tim from the beginning and it pisses me off that they dragged it on as long as they did just for them to end up with each other like EVERYONE knew they would 🙄 Lucy's role became all about Bradford and that's annoying. There's not a episode that goes by where lucy is not hung up on Bradford any time they showed her is was basically all about him🙄 which I feel diminished her character, because she worked so hard to become a P2. Lucy literally makes me hate the show! And aside from all that the slow is VERY predictable. Makes me not want to watch.
0	Good show. Very bad Fallout show. The show doesn't adhere to Fallout lore and they don't understand how the world works. The characters have a very obvious amount of makeup. Why would people with a finite amount of resources use them for makeup to make themselves look pretty. The power armor very obviously had no weight to them which made the added sounds even more jarring. They put fat people in the vault where they have regimented food. The raiders blow up a bomb with remote tech. The outfits are aways clean. Its the same with the locations they go to. Everyone and everywhere is too clean. They seem have forgotten this is post apocalypse. The world and people in the show doesn't look or act like atomic fallout has happened, they really mention rads and they don't encounter any radiation in the irradiated wasteland.
0	This was a great show for 6 seasons. Then the budget went up and the plot down in season 7. Season 8 it all falls apart, where did the time go. Utter trash, worse ending than Lost! All that great dialogue, character building thrown in the bin and replaced with non sensical cgi rubbish. If you haven't started watching this already, don't bother.
0	"This has to be the worst adaptation I've ever laid eyes on, if one could even call it that. Quite literally, everything is changed for the worse, even the simplest details that did not need a change. I'm not even talking about ""westernization"" of the plot, like changing the character names, the place that the story takes place etc. Think about any scene in the series and it's either completely different in the books, or it doesn't even exist. The whole concept of ""countdown"" is way too simplified and the entire suspense of it is gone. It wasn't long ago that we had 24 episode per season series, and a lot of the plot that's cut doesn't even require any CGI. Ye Wenjie has almost completely different personality. Everything that makes Shi Qiang, Da Shi is competely gone, well other than the fact that he smokes a lot. I suppose our brilliant producers thought that smoking a lot is enough personality trait. There are so many things I could write just from the first episode alone but what's the point.I strongly suggest everyone to not watch this piece of garbage, either read the books or just spend your time on something else altogether.Finally, remember these names: David Benioff, D. B. Weiss.Do not ever forget them, and avoid everything like a plague with their name on it. They are the masters of alchemy, except instead of transmuting common metals to gold, they transmute gold to a pile of worthless dust. They must be the worst producers of this century."
0	All I ever wanted was to get a series of one of my most beloved sci-fi Novels. Is that to much to ask? The characters are very two dimensional and unfortunately, careless. You don't feel like they actually understand the gravity of the situation they are in. This, however, is not due to poor acting, no, it is thanks to terrible writing on behalf of the directors. Thomas Wade as well has been ruined even though the casting wasn't to far of with what I could imagine him looking like. On one hand the series tries to stick to the novels while on the other it actively rebels against them. I guess it had a few good moments. For example the talks between the Trisolarans (I refuse to call them anything else than that) and Evans were very tense and made them seem more threatening. I don't know what else to say really, this is sad.
2	"The show is beautifully shot and the story is very compelling. The Japanese cast includes some truly heavy hitters (Hiroyuki Sanada and Tadanobu Asano are legends, imo).The only thing that brings it down slightly for me is the terrible, hammy overacting of Cosmo Jarvis. I don't know if it's the script that was written for him or what, but his performance just comes off as so...unwatchable. It's like he's trying to do a third-rate channeling of Tom Hardy (who by the way would have been fantastic in this role, in my opinion). Every time Blackthorne opens his mouth I just want to cringe.Shogun is still very much worth watching because thankfully, Blackthorne is just one small part of an otherwise excellent ensemble cast. This show runs laps around ""House of the Dragon"" or any other recent period limited drama."
0	Nathan did his thing and was one of the few positive things about the show. However, the show lacked pace as it jumped from scene to scene with a lack of continuity. I could watch future episodes but won't because the characters are such prototypes that you can't possibly care about them, Like the tough cop who becomes instantly weepy at the sight of his wife who he hasn't seen in a year. Um, okay but there is no why. Totally unrealistic but not more than a petite cop getting the best of a big guy in a sidewalk tussle. Really? A complete disappointment filled with cliches you've seen many times before.
0	The new series take a lot of liberty in the story telling unlike the book or the original 80s series. As I have read and seen those, I can explain to my spouse and kids what is happening. Although the first episodes did follow the book closely, more and more it deviates on important events. As if the budget would not allow further elaboration. Without me explaining to my family what is happening, I doubt whether they can actually understand what is exactly going on and who is who. Also the bad guys are not so devious as in the book or the original series. The scenes, costumes, sword dueling and so on are very good and give a nice view of feudal Japan. It is a good series to watch but not as epic as the original series. As such I do not understand the very high rating.
1	I liked watching for the first 2-3 seasons, without knowing I was in season 3. But once I look at it there are a lot episodes in each season, and there are a lot of seasons too. I felt kind of bored, may be because I binge watched like 5 seasons in 3 weeks, but also it is getting too emotional for a series which I expected more medical things.... I am usually strong heart and minded, but watching lot of grey's anatomy built depression during nights and in the sleep. Do not watch a lot episodes in a day.... That's my recommendation... I stopped watching after season 5, may be someday I watch others....
0	My rating of this show is low as found boring. I have read the book and loved it and series does not grasp even a fraction of that. The korean dramas are so popular because they show the content with emotions in details and keep you involved. Don't know why they had to run a bullet train here, many more episodes could had been added. Missed many important events like Yabushige's suicide and the events leading upto it. They did go in depth of Mariko and Pilot's emotional relationship. Did not show Toranaga decision of burning Anjin ships. Missed out on showing the inter personal relations between characters, also missed out on showing the real political issues and role of religion in that era and lastly forget to mention the conclusion, result of the war which was mentioned in the book.
0	I'm a big fan of this genre but this show is just not it.Pros: 1)amazing sceneries. Video is high level, no doubt 2)that's itCons: 1)plain boring. Endless dialogues, maybe 10min of actual action each episodes. I was fast forwarding all the time and...what's the point to watch it then?2)I'm sorry but I don't wanna read subtitles for 45-50 minutes each episode(reminder: it's all dialogues non stop, mostly in Japanese) 3)Actors aren't the best, mediocre play 4)probably most of people aren't familiar with Japanese history so explanation would be nice. They just throw random words like Shogun, Ronin, Samurai etc expecting wow effect? Guys nobody knows who ronins areOverall huge waste of time, I stopped mid 4th episode with no plans to continue.
0	I started hating Meredith's character since the middle of season 2.since season 3 session 22 I hated her even more.her mother died a few sessions ago.It was as if nothing has happened.She started calling her 'my dead mother' with such lack of emotion.this session her father's wife dies and she bursts into tears!this is ridiculous!she is such a stranger worshiper.And I detest these people as unfortunately my aunt is a one herself. Secondly,in the previous season she called her mother a whore,though this is she herself who sleeps with every man she feels like and hurts every body's feelings and ruins others lives.And after all she justifies herself!she thinks she's a saint!she's the most promiscuous character I've ever seen in my life. It's really a pity that such an invidious character is the leading role of this really good movie. I hope that Ellen Pompeo herself,doesn't resemble Meredith at all!
0	I absolutely despise this last season. If I wanted to watch or hear about COVID I would turn on the news. I don't need to be watching it on one of my favorite shows that I view to get away from reality. Also I get that they're trying to make people aware of what goes on in the world but literally you don't need to shove it down our throats and try to squeeze legit every political view in at all times. This show used to be my favorite but this latest season has tanked all good memories it holds. Absolute trash. Ellen needs to step back from producing/directing and let Shonda do her thing.
0	Dumb and dumber ruined the whole series in only 1 season, that's a great achievement..
1	I liked it enough to binge watch it. The premise is great and interesting. I think by the end I had a lot of questions about how this show laid out. A lot of the charcters especially the oxford 5 made little sense and seemed just to be there to somehow ground us, I guess. Just bored me. All these scientist are supposed to be the best in the world and there all in their late 20's? I never read the book so cant comment on how well it follows it. Im suprised how much information seems left out though. Half way through I was like, they going to need several more series of this to draw it together hopefully.
0	I do not understand all the hype for this show. The first season is more about porn than anything else. Later that kinda fades away, and when characters are not walking naked it's actually s decent show. But that's it, i don't see anything special about it.EDIT: Last season ruined the few things that the show had going for it. It did not get one star simply because there were interesting episodes in a few seasons so i couldn't get muself to do it. But it deserves one star. Writing in last few seasons is simply horrible.
1	Season 8 ruined everything. It was the best tv series until s08e03
2	"Good show with a good role for ""Castle"" Nathan Fillion. Not that the other actors are any less... Looking forward to season 2."
2	Probably one of the best TV series I've ever watched.Amazing story and writing (at least the first 7 seasons), great acting, phenomenal soundtrack.It could have been a 10/10, and perhaps the best TV series of all time were it not for the 8th season.For those who still have not watched the series - go watch it! It may be a frustrating ending, as you've all probably heard, but it's still worth your time.
0	When I started watching this, it seemed like it would be a really good show. Is each episode went on I got more and more frustrated with the writing and the actual storyline. If this was actually based on a real story and a person was an accused stalker of multiple people and started stalking you the cops would definitely be all over this but instead they ignore the situation they ignore the guy having the problem and even after he is physically assaulted by her nothing happens. It seems completely unrealistic. The main character is also frustrating in his weird obsession with his stalker and his laziness to do anything about it. I don't feel anything for this main character except apathy after watching every episode of this show. It also makes the police department in any country, look useless. For me this storyline while entertaining, is so unrealistic in this day and age.
2	I played all the Fallout games and had a great time watching it! There are references to every game in the series, so people who have played at least one game will get their share of the nostalgia cake.The only thing that bothered me was the typical American-racial convention of the series, which in itself doesn't bother me, there is and must be this American vibe throughout Fallout because that's what this game is based on, BUT that makes it easy to guess what's going to happen, e.g. In the first episode, the husband is white, so I already knew it was going to be bad, although when I saw him, I thought he was either a drug addict or a violent person. But then the frame showed that everyone was dirty and cut up and I already knew who they were, because people from the crypt don't look like that, maybe they were subjected to some kind of experiment.Apart from this small stumble, the series is very well made, the set designers did a great job looking at the locations and their filling, although they were probably afraid to play more aggressively with the light. The actors played well, where Moises Arias, Walton Goggins and Jon Daly, definitely the best.Overall, a very good series!
1	"8 for the first two seasons, 6 for the third one (more are not available in my country at the moment).This is the story of three rookies in the LAPD. Being in his fourties, officer Nolan is the oldest one. This role was the reason I started to watch the series. I am above 50 and I just began a ""new life"" as a paramedic, so I somehow felt connected to another old rookie.I did not expect this series to be so funny, but it is. To be honest, in the beginning it is quite silly. It stays funny, but the longer it goes, the more serious approaches will develop.I think that the lead character would have been perfect for Jason Bateman, but Nathan Fillian does his job well. For me the star of this series is Melissa O'Neill though. She plays rookie officer Chen in such a charming and irresistible way, you are forced to feel with her (and she's having a rough ride)."
1	It is the ancient and feudal Japan in the era of the Discoveries. There was a huge effort on having the show speaking Japanese, with Japanese actors and sets that turn the story very authentic. However, as Portuguese, I was expecting to see the same effort, since in the show the Japanese are trading with the Portuguese; but no, not even a Portuguese word is spoken even though they are supposedly speaking Portuguese. So, since the protagonist is English and speaks Portuguese, all those dialogs are in English or Japanese, affecting the comprehension of the story. They should have done the same as in Vikings, an excellent reference they should have followed: at least some dialogs should start in Portuguese so that the story could be better understood. Also, there are some twists and details that make the understanding of the whole plot a little hard. Even though it is a show worth watching.
0	"The first two seasons were good, but the over-the-top heroics in season 3 have become comical, reminds me of the old 60's Batman show. POW! ZAP! ZOWIE! The scene where Nila single handedly delivers her own baby, cuts the cord, cleans it, wraps it in a blankie while disarming/overpowering/arresting the armed bad guy (all within the space of a few of minutes), then says ""by the way, its a girl."" We laughed until we had tears. Show is becoming rediculous. The new rookie girl is becoming tedious with her nonstop supposed spiritual hoodoo. I believe a real police TO would be fired for allowing this little twit to do the stuff she has done because of her ""spirituality"" or whatever it is supposed to be. Its not interesting or inspiring, its just stupid. I hope the writers will improve the current downward trajectory before it completely crashes and burns, make The Rookie watchable again. They proved in season 2 that they can deftly handle social issues without resorting to these nonstop cliches and super hero cops."
2	This is so far my favourite TV series where medicine is involved. There's a lot of drama in lives of doctors. You can learn so much and maybe become braver like me if you ever need to go on some surgery.
2	This show was brilliant. It tells a story in which we see two severely wounded souls build a strange and damaging relationship, yet it's so much more than that. All the characters were very complex and interesting, with the help of the extremely talented actors, who really did their characters justice and managed to portrait mentall illness and trauma excellently. It's a very intense series with various sensitive and untouchable topics and it really makes the viewer feel deeply and gives a very sour aftertaste. The show keeps you at the edge of your seat and makes you feel a whirlwind of emotions. I enjoyed every second of this series and loved everything down to the fantastic choice of music, the shocking twists, and obviously the show-stopping ending. The show affectes you and is definitely that impactful that it alters the way you view life and makes you realize the power of the human mind. This was definitely a hard watch but we rarely get Television content as good as this, so if you can handle tough scenes, you definitely need to watch this.
2	I am a Chinese and I read the novels in my college years about 15 years ago. Well let's be straight this is not for you if you can't stand any deviations being made in a TV show adapted from books. However, I found myself quite enjoying the watching although at the very two episodes it was a bit challenging to know who is WHO, which became clear after 3 episodes.Let's admit it there would be no way to properly make someone feel exactly how they felt the first time they read a great novel (TLOTR is one great exception here, Long Live Saint Peter). This Netflix version, however, is NOT BAD. The way it connects the characters can be a little bit too intentional but it's not a bad adoption. I like seeing how they improved the chemistry between Chen Xin and Yun Tian Ming and their story in season one here is one of the highlights.All I want to say is I am OK with adaption so long it make sense logically. In this case, Netflix version did a good job.
0	Seriously, a nineteenth season?? This should have ended 4 or 5 years ago, it used to be good but it has turned into an awful show that i don't watch anymore and don't want to watch, they let it go on way too long.
2	This was a pleasant surprise! I really liked this adaptation, which I watched over the weekend. Much better than most science fiction series. The visuals are captivating and the characters are convincingly portrayed with deep emotions. Yes, the movie diverges from the book. The book was written from a Chinese point of view, and most of this series takes place in England, with different characters. But that doesn't affect the story at all.The nice thing about Cixin Liu, the book's author, is his exploration of ideas about our future and possible encounters with alien life, that has a level of technology far exceeding ours. His work shows he's a great admirer of the grandmaster of SF, Isaac Asimov, and he gives us completely new visions about scientific theories and technology we can hardly imagine. That is the essence of good science fiction.I can recommend this series to anyone, the sf-lovers as well as anyone else. See how contact is made with an alien civilization on a planet lightyears away, and see our society reacting when the aliens are setting out to invade earth in 400 years.Given the quality of these episodes, I cannot wait for the other two books to be adapted to the screen. There are some crazy new ideas about dark forest theories and the end of stars and civilisations.
0	They obviously spent a lot of money on new sets but that did not add much to the show. The acting is worse. The writing is terrible. The plot is juvenile. The medical content is quite unbelievable. Hopefully things improve in episode two and beyond or we are witnessing the last season.
0	"I wrote an Amazon review when I finally got around to watching GoT and ended up with crazed fans coming out of the woodwork to tell me how wrong I was to not like GoT. After watching more episodes because - as GoT fans insisted - I needed to see MORE to understand/like the show - I decided that the GoT is not for me - even if the beatings will continue 'till morale will improve.. Watching more didn't improve my opinion really - it only made me feel nauseated. I felt I was only stating the obvious in saying that there is a lot of pointless gratuitous sex and graphic violence on GoT. For some - that's what they like about the show. For me - it's a needless distraction to what could have been a compelling story.Here is my original review of GoT:As a lifelong geek, I've been hearing a lot about GoT for a while now and had high hopes of it filling the much-needed niche for satisfying story-telling that I came to know and love in such shows as Firefly and the Lord of the Rings trilogy - or at least something intelligent, interesting, creative and well thought out. Visually, Game of Thrones is gorgeous - at least in the initial snow speckled scenes, where you see a group of heavily bundled up guys in a very stark snow scape. Just one look at the costuming and the beautiful filming really sparks any geek to say, ""Hey- this might be really good."" Knowing that the guy who was Boromir in LoTR is playing a major role also gives hopes and expectations of something really great.The initial scenes where one of the riders stumbles upon a truly grisly scene of carnage is difficult to watch - but at least you get the sense that there is something going on, some kind of mystery - that needs to be solved and the question of just who the White Walkers are is intriguing. So despite the gore, I was initially very much taken in.And that's about where my interest stopped as the first episode devolved into pointless scenes of violence, sex, nudity, more sex - still more sex - to the point where it became a bit absurd and almost dull. So sad to ruin something that could have been epic with a lot of sex scenes that weren't even in the original books. The gore and grisly scenes of beheadings and splatter porn also painfully reminded me of the really horrible rendition of the Hobbit, where something that was written as a kid's story (talking about the Hobbit here) was made into a gory display of constant sword fights and beheadings. It kind of reduces all of human existence to one that is animalistic and somewhat mundane: animals are born, they hunt for and/or find food, they have sex, make other little animals, fight each other for territory (possibly) and die. Fine. But a fantasy that makes it seem like all of human existence boils down to this common denominator (and nothing more) is not only uninteresting and uninspired - it's dead depressing. It also seems such a waste of excellent casting, costuming, cinematographic excellence and a story that might capture my interest - if the makers of the series wasn't so insistent and determined to fill every scene with sex of every sort and violence. All the flying offal and swinging tits really distract from what might have been an interesting story.The first episode of GoT was the most graphic thing I've ever seen - including that time when some college housemates rented a porn movie and that other time when some other friends had a halloween horror movie marathon. At least the gore in those movies had a point and made sense in the progress of the story, whatever story that was and the sex scenes actually were important in the plot - or at least vaguely important for the plot. (It's saying something when the sex and gore in the average horror flick is more meaningful than the sex and gore in GoT.) All the sex and blood splattered scenes of GoT just seem to make the whole thing less believable. It's hard to really get lost in the story and really imagine being there - when every scene is a blood-soaked and sex-filled rampage to the point of being ridiculous. The sex seems less real - because there's so much of it. The gore seems less important - because there's too much of it. The actual story is completely overwhelmed by the heavy-handedness all the sex and violence.If a fellow geek friend were to ask me about Game of Thrones - I would comment that the opening credits were really nicely done - with a sort of steampunk, nanotechnology and clever clockwork building of the map, castles, houses and landscape with these interesting ladders connecting various areas of the map. The opening credits was awesome - far more inspired than the series itself. The music is well done. The casting is brilliant (and would have been amazing - or could have been, if such talent wasn't wasted and drowned out by all the other stuff.) Visually (when every scene isn't blood soaked and/or crammed from end to end with pointless sex and violence) - Game of Thrones is really beautiful - with its gorgeous period costuming and sets and great cinematography. The actual story - the one that I might have been more interested in learning more about, if it weren't for all the gore, guts and grunts - is something I'm sad that I won't get a chance to know without reading a plot synopsis somewhere else. But the actual series just comes off as a porn flick with lots and lots of violence that happens to be set in the middle ages."
1	"What had to be expected from Bethesda. As a long time fan of 1 and 2 I was already well aware Bethesda never understood Fallout. Fallout isn't about some 1950s retro future, that world got nuked and is gone! All that remains of that time are uncanny relics of the past. Bethesda Fallout looks and feels like the bombs fell 20 years ago and we're bearly making a comeback, not 200 years later.Also the ""Ghouls are Zombies"" thing is a hill Bethesda is apparently willing to die on.Costumes and settings look quite nice, the female lead is convincing. Turning the whole message to ""capitalism bad"" is laughable coming from Amazon. Also way too light hearted. Has vibes of Suicide Squad but without being funny. Also retcons a lot of Fallout 1,2 and New Vegas. Mediocre show at best."
0	The Rookie really is very enjoyable to watch. The acting, humour, moral stories with here and there some action and drama, it all fits nicely together.. well, until season 3 that is. From that moment on it turned into some woke PC travesty of a TV-show, that tries to push some political agenda down your throat. For me this became too painful to watch, such a shame. One star.
2	I loved how they castigated the true nature of sexual shift and how people out of nowhere declare that there sexual preferences have changed. Especially in Hollywood! It's a food for thought. It makes you wonder why people seem so confused about their identities these days. As shown in the series one always force such dark incidents in their hindbrain. This is the way one survives traumatic experiences. Such series leave me thinking that still there are people in the west who believe in natural course of things. That's the beauty of literature, you don't have to directly state what you want to state.
2	I have faithfully watched Greys since the beginning. I have rewatched it at least twice. I like the characters and their interactions and the medical part is interesting too. It's one downfall is that lately I feel like the writers are preaching their politics at me. Several episodes were very close to turning me off of one of my favorite shows.
2	"The Netflix series, Ripley, might be appreciated more by those unfamiliar with the 1999 Matt Damon film, The Talented Mr. Ripley. Both are adaptations of Patricia Highsmith's novel. Frankly, I like both versions. However, Some may enjoy this production more without knowing the story in advance.The characters' ages in this version are more in line with the book, and the performances are solid. Dakota Fanning's performance was ok, but I couldn't help but wonder if another actress might have brought more to the role.This new 8-episode series is a more faithful adaptation of the novel. It captures the psychological thriller essence of the novel, delving deeper into the moral ambiguity of Tom Ripley's psyche. In addition, the Italian locations chosen here create a feel closer to the novel than in the 1999 movie. So does ""the look"" of this production, thanks to the choice of Cinematographer Robert Elswit. He has created a gorgeous black-and-white masterpiece. Like any painting, photography is all about the lighting. It's no coincidence that this production exhibits the same strong artistic qualities as the Caravaggio paintings that Greenleaf and then Ripley become obsessed with.I really enjoyed all eight episodes, but I believe it would have been even better if the footage had been cut down to a seven-episode series. In other words, I think some tightening would have improved it. I suspect the creators were as impressed by the cinematography as I was, making it difficult to trim it down. I believe tighter editing would have increased the tension and suspense, which are already intense in several scenes. I also appreciated the dark humor injected occasionally. It's very Hitchcockian."
2	I really enjoy Gray's Anatomy so much that I binged watch the first seasons on Netflix. So all the way up to season 13 I really felt the emotional highs and lows from every episode. Or Almost all. I love all the complicated but pretty real situations that are portrayed. I expect this when I'm watching. I just started watching season 14 on Netflix and have to say episode 5, where Amelia has a brain tumor was like an after thought. I thought it would of been the main focus. Maybe since my sister has gone through 3 brain surgeries and having Amelia bouncing back so quickly, especially with the size of her tumor in the show was a disappointment. Episode 4 had your jaw drop when you found out but it lost its momentum. I think Shondra Rimes is excellent at capturing her audience attention. Episode 5 tho felt like a quickie.
1	I've been a super fan to chase this drama for days on Netflix, episode after episode, deeply touched by many plots. However, I suddenly felt tired and had enough at the end of season 8 when the plane crash happened. I mean, do you have to kill people in order to carry the series forward?! No: Grey can live with sister forever, Slone can marry Lexie, Shepherd doesn't have to die...It's too much of a drama, I can't stand it anymore.
0	Even with such a high budget, the special effects are mediocre at best. Regarding Ye Wenjie's spiritual core and the complexity of the characters, the screenwriter and producers only scratch the surface. The entire series is filled with Western society's stereotypes and arrogant disrespect towards Eastern countries. I felt deeply offended and uncomfortable. It's regrettable that my first IMDb review is for The Three-Body Problem, the Netflix version. What's even more disappointing is that many of the highlights from the original work are either deleted or drastically altered in the TV series. The actors clearly haven't read the original work and lack a basic understanding of their characters.
2	It's a good show but as a european watcher i feel like every single historical tv show nowadays depicts the English under a good light. It becomes tiresome, and it is biaised, so would be nice if the studios hear that voice one time, that it would have been a good opportunity to have a more unusuale and international vibe and to know more about the portugal / japan partnership gor example rather than involving these perpetual English characters. Make english the spoken language, that's not the point, the point is to show something different historically speaking. Apart from that the show is enjoyable, thank you for producing it.
0	Sorry for my time waste it (10 YEARS) I feel scared about Chernobil of HBO
0	Game Of Thrones went from best series of all time to a video game of action with a bad script. The depth of it all disappeared between idiotic romances and beautiful war scenes. The biggest disappointment.
1	Hard to express how disappointed I am about the post-season development of the show. Writers after George R.R. Martin destroyed all the principles that made the show so great - that distinguished GoT among all the sweet heroic fairy tales.The episode 3 of season 8 gave the final mortal blow to this epic saga, thanks to such an under-developed evil (night king) character and backstory development.Such a poor cheap illogical writing. So many plot holes... So many cheap tricks just to entertain the audience...
2	(Disclaimer, fan of the book and original series) I feel like it has been slightly rushed, you don't really get a sense of time passing. Some of the story has been glossed over a bit and some of the side characters have become relegated to a cameo. They kinda just jump right into it. It's not necessarily a bad thing but I feel it's paced a bit quick and could be confusing to people new to the series. Perhaps a narrator would've helped? Some of the dialogue has been dumbed down a little and shortened. The prison scene should've also done a better job showing him being taught a little of the language and politics. Still, overall I'm hooked and can't wait to watch the rest :)
1	"While there is certainly a lot to praise in this rendition of the Fallout universe, I still can't really call myself a fan of this show.Beginning with the praise, this show was beautiful to look at. The cinematography was strong, the costumes were great, the production design was absolutely fantastic, and the visual effects were well done. Basically every technical aspect of the show was very well done and often times exceptionally so.The makeup for the ghouls was excellent, the designs for the creatures and world were stylish and interesting, and the action sequences were well choreographed and well executed.Beyond the technicals, the show's cartoonish tone and sense of humor was sometimes very effective. There were a few times that it made me chuckle, no doubt. And I was genuinely impressed with the setup of the story. The initial scene that established the Nuclear Fallout was excellent, and Lucy's introduction was very well done. You get a real sense of who she is almost immediately and are drawn into her perspective effortlessly.Part of that is the lead actress' talent. In fact, nearly every member of the cast performed their roles quite well (with a few notable exceptions).And overall, despite my criticisms (which I'll get into), there were definitely moments in the story that were entertaining and engaging. I was curious about the mysteries the show introduced and was interested enough to follow it to the conclusion.But that's all the praise I have to offer. Now, I'm afraid, is the time to discuss my criticisms.For one thing, the story's cartoonish tone and sardonic attitude made it hard for me to really get invested in the dramatic aspects of the story. And the show definitely wanted me to be invested and really care for the big dramatic revelations during the finale, but I just wasn't buying into it. The final episode was full of big twists that I saw coming a mile away (partly because they were very unsubtle in setting them up) but also because it's actually such a cliche trope at this point. The father character, who the protagonist idealized, is actually a bad man... SO SHOCKING!I found the introduction for Lucy's story to be interesting but as it went on it just repetitive and less and less engaging as it went on. Her disillusionment felt forced. It was driven by a series of reveals where things she admired or cared about were systematically deconstructed and shown to be evil all along, just like her dad. And over and over that just kept happening, and it just became trite and predictable before long. I didn't feel any emotion for her story in the final episode.The Ghoul (who's also the cowboy actor, I'm forgetting his name) also had the same arc and his character was a symbol of the deconstructionist mentality of the entire script. His false cowboy identity is the perfect metaphor for what this story is saying overall. The ""cowboy"" is a myth that's just a nice looking mask for bad men who were violent and what not. That heroic ideal isn't real, it's just a mask. Just like the Ghoul's wife isn't really a good woman, she's a cartoonishly evil corporate monster who pretends to be good. The one thing I actually like though about the cowboy angle is how it's a reversal of Lucy's role in the story. The cowboy tames the wilderness, Lucy is made wild by the wilderness. That was pretty cool.Easily the worst character in the story was Maximus. His contribution was so bland and poorly executed, I wondered why they even included it. He was a character I really felt nothing for. They didn't stress what his attachment or investment in anything was. I never felt his motivations properly. I observed that he was unhappy with being bullied, I guess. But his murderous lying attitude made him fundamentally unlikable and stopped my from pittying him like I think the script wanted me to. His plotlines are overly driven by convenience and contrivance, and he's ultimately given a redemption arc that feels entirely unearned. He also has a very thin and emotionless romance with the lead that I felt absolutely nothing for. His friendship with the nonbinary brother was emotionless as well. I just felt like every scene with him was a waste of screen time.Oh and did I mention that not all the humor is funny? And that when it isn't funny, it's actually fairly annoying? A mismatch between silly Ned Flanders like performance and brutal violence or dialogue is only funny so many times before it gets old...And I don't know, in general this show is so cynical and mean sprited. It takes every opportunity to claim that wholesomeness or reciprocity is little more than a mask for selfishness. It makes sure to try and ""disillusion"" the viewers of the idea of ""good guys"" as nothing more than naivete but then it has cartoonishly evil ""bad guys"" who are greedy illuminati types that have nothing but selfish/bad intentions for their actions. If believing in fundamentally good guys is naive, then isn't believing in fundamentally bad guys? Because ultimately that's the same thing. It just shifts a good guy into meaning ""not as bad as the really bad guys"".The whole show mocks and insults the naivete of the vault dwellers and seems to suggest that their reciprocal ideal is old fashioned and just a cynical lie, but I don't buy that. I also don't think the story earns that as a conclusion, I think it contrives that conclusion. Lucy's story reminds me of the classic ""small town girl moves to the big city"" story. She's from this small, sheltered community and heads out to the ""real world"" and is forced to adapt and become less ""small town"" in order to make it. I think that's where this whole show's philosophy comes from. It's city dwellers who have internalized the ""only look out for yourself"" ethic as universal and then cynically insist that everyone secretly feels the same way deep down. And projecting that mentality onto an Apocalypse suggests that it's human nature to feel this way.But again, that feels like a contrivance. I'm certainly convinced that there's genuine value in those ethics that the show failed to confront, and that failure made it hard for me to get invested in Lucy's character turn because I didn't feel ""disillusioned"" along with her. I just felt like ""well they just decided to make everyone with that point of view a liar, that feels totally contrived. It doesn't prove or convince me of anything"".Perhaps you're an extremely cynical person. Or perhaps you're just not keen to interpret themes so intently. If you read it at merely a surface level, I could see enjoying it just for the jokes and the spectacle.Before the end of the review I must also point out the irony of the ""anti capitalist"" messaging in the show. Coming from Amazon of all places, that's totally rich.But yeah, not the worst show ever. Not by a long shot. In fact, it has many redeeming aspects. And depending on how deeply you intend to read into the story or your worldview this could be more or less enjoyable. I personally found the messaging to be a roadblock but I can see that hasn't been an issue for many others. But I am having a hard time understanding why other people seem to think it's well written as a narrative. I just don't find it to be engaging or emotionally effective. Lucy is the only character I care about and the rest feel like 1-2 dimensional cartoons and little more. The drama lacked drama, so to speak. But that's just how I felt.It's worth checking out regardless. If you're not sold by episode 3, then turn it off."
0	How is this show entertaining? All I see on this show is doctors making out and not doing what doctors do.This show is probably the most overrated show on television. Like I just said, all it shows is doctors and nurses making out during shifts. Hell, usually when they do have a patient, it dies because they are too busy having sex in the operation room.Now we have to suffer Private Practice? This show is unrealistic and is stupid. Try watching ER instead. Now that's a good show other then this piece of $hit.2/10
2	Good music (it's nice that they got some of the songs from the fallout games), good atmosphere, nice setting with an new story set in the fallout universe but that Maximus character has got to be the dumbest guy ever portrayed and I've seen Home Alone. Maybe they tried to make it funny but it isn't. It's cringe. The main character is a dits but it's normal because she grew up in a vault with everyone following that 1950s atomic attitude. All smiles and all rigid but that's how it should be. Also too bad we don't enough scavenging and looting of weapons and armour as in the games but that's ok.
0	The ending ruined it. No heart in that episode. Hollow ending
2	I wanted to give the series 10 stars, but Johnny Flynn's portrayal of Richard Greenleaf just didn't have the charisma that was needed.Jude Law's Greenleaf was good-looking, unpredictable, fun, etc. A person with magnetism. Whereas, this one seem tired and settled. The only rise out of him was about how many ice cube trays the refrigerator should have.Dakota Fanning does a great job, and shows that there was no need for the film to have two female characters. Eliot Sumner isn't who I had in mind for the character of Freddie Miles. When he first appeared, I thought it was a boyish-looking woman. Sumner did the job well, but even though the actor is in his 30s, he looked like a teenager.Having said all that. The cinematography was beautiful and it was great to see how Ripley not just evolved, but also his reactions after murdering someone. The getting rid of the bodies, and other evidence, the cleaning up afterwards, creating alibis, trying to outwit everyone day after day. It's not just physically tiring but mentally as well.
0	This is a great series Sanada and Sawai are absolutely stunning. But this series should not be called Shogun. It is so far removed form the source material that I am at a loss as to understand why the Clavell estate didn't put their legal foot down and stop production. The story vaguely follows the timeliness of the book but places so much emphasis on the development of the characters of Toranaga and Mariko that it does a severe disservice to the essential element of the book. Which is Blackthorne's slow and inexorable assimilation into the Japanese culture. It also glosses over the basic antagonistic relationship between the Catholic and Protestant Characters in the novel. A really rousing series but it is so different from the novel as to be almost unrecognizable.
2	"As a fan of Nathan Fillion through his ""Firefly"" and ""Castle"" series, I happily anticipated this new series. Having watched the pilot, I am not disappointed. Once again, his affable personality is a highlight. Fortunately, this series has much more going for it, especially a stellar cast.The basic story is about a 40-year-old police rookie, John Nolan, who is trying to find himself after major life changes. As it turns out, this rookie has an uncanny ability to engage suspects on a personal level. But that might not be enough to keep him on the force. His watch sergeant plans to harass him until he quits.There are actually three rookies and the series follows all of them and their training officers. The pilot takes them through their first days of on-the-job training. The show demonstrates many of the technical issues officers have to master and the personal issues that can result from this demanding occupation.The pilot has plenty of action and a good mix of interesting challenges for the rookie officer Nolan.Update 1-18-21: This review applies to the first two seasons only because I did not watch the third."
0	I felt like I was watching a rerun of the final season of Game of Thrones. Did the series have something to do with the books? Yes, sort of, but everything was extremely rushed, particularly the most important and wonderful parts of the books, the mind-blowing ideas. Instead, Benioff and Weiss added a whole bunch of extraneous characters and storylines, which have nothing to do with the book and which didn't add to the story in any way, but only proved how politically correct they could be. The environmental message was completely lost. The author's fascinating views and ideas of how a human society would be transformed by the knowledge that they were going to be attacked by aliens with vastly superior technology- also lost in favor of producing Disney-like storylines instead. I hated how much everything was dumbed down. All of the Chinese locations were changed to Oxford, England of all places and names were Anglicized. Clearly Americans are too dumb to remember Chinese names. The wonderful physics puzzles which gradually unfold in the books were glossed over with lightning speed in favor of hot chicks with swords. The video game was totally ruined imo. Again, clearly Benioff and Weiss think that Americans are too dumb to understand physics, even when explained by someone as amazing as Cixin Liu. And I'm no physics genius. I was always terrible at physics in school, but the author explains it so well that even I can understand it. Overall, this felt like yet another ho-humm marvel movie. If you really want to know what the book was about, read it. If reading is not your thing, then watch the Chinese series, which is currently airing on prime. It has its flaws: it's too drawn out and has the most god-awful soundtrack, but it's very faithful to the source material and overall an excellent film adaptation with a very genuine feel to it. If you want to see a movie series, in which the source material was completely transformed to make the story more exciting and interesting while preserving the author's original ideas, watch Foundation. I won't be watching any more garbage by Benioff and Weiss.
0	Loved the show. It was different enough from the other cop dramas to make it interesting + the Nathan is amazing everywhere he plays. First 2 seasons were very enjoyable, but the last one went full BLM. Most people don't watch TV shows for political commentery, they watch it to be entertained (I'm one of them). Still, will keep an eye on this show. But unless they get politics out of here, I'm done with it.
0	"It feels like they've stretched a good film into a mini-series unnecessarily. The black and white cinematography feels like a gimmick, and the inclusion of irrelevant clips adds to the confusion. While it does offer some insight into Ripley's backstory, the performances come across as lackluster and fail to breathe life into the characters. Overall, it's a lackluster experience that struggles to hold the audience's attention or leave a lasting impact. The series downfall lies in the director's excessive creative freedom, which detracts from the original's brilliance. By attempting to inject artistic flair, they've instead diluted the essence of what made the original so captivating. Particularly disappointing is the mishandling of Freddy's character, stripping away the complexity that defined him. The casting choices for the ""show"" feel off, especially considering the nostalgic journey they aimed to take viewers on. Additionally, the CGI depicting the boat burning is egregiously poor, serving as a glaring reminder of the film's shortcomings. Overall, it's a letdown for fans who expected more from a beloved classic."
1	In a normal wold, a series like that should have been discontinued after the first season. If it did not, it means that it is subsidised, like The Young and the restless. A rich family is probably paying big money to keep it going. They should however hire a real actress for the maim role.
1	Used to be a good show. Showing the positive of law enforcement. Now it went Hollywood liberal anti cop. Sad because they had the opportunity to show the good law enforcement can do in a community and just went with the false leftist narrative instead.
1	Extremely deformed version of the book that evacuates most the philosophical and scientific elements that made the book win the Nebula Prize.It isnt a complete waste of time though, but This is not HBO. The quality of the acting, the CG and the teleplay is on par with B level sf series the likes of Salvation or Manifest. The styling and the cliches are often unbearable, for example, the 3 piece suit wearing Intelligence officer stting by himself in an office looking like a trendy manahattan bar,. (Facepalm) And i will not discuss the DEI washing that took the story out of China like where it's supposed to be.Fun but dont expact too much.
0	a. lacking cohesion : loose. b. lacking orderly continuity, arrangement, or relevance : inconsistent (an incoherent essay) c. lacking normal clarity or intelligibility in speech or thought.Because this fault appears to have been deliberately built in by the screen writers and producers, possibly in order to extend the number of seasons over which the story is to be run, I can only rate this 3/10. Without the built in incoherence, this could have lived up to it's 9+ rating.Certainly the actors deserve as much, as I believe the acting to be superb.
0	"First of all let me start by saying I just rewatched Twin Peaks. To watch another TV show after that is sort of like eating a big ice cream sundae right before dinner.But, it really helps to put it into perspective how bad this production is. Let's start from the first scenes of pre fallout world. There is no time to feel suspense at all about impending doom. We have no feelings for any of the characters. We have five minutes of slow mo at a children's birthday party. It's like the writers of the show are just saying ""how can we get there fastest?"" and things are tossed into the script to serve a purpose for the writers. A good writer could make an entire season about pre fallout world.Why am I mentioning this? Because the entire show is like this. This is the dialogue between writers: "" people need to die. "" "" who?"" "" I don't know, write them into the script so that they CAN die. It serves a function to get us to X""""bombs need to fall"" ""how?"" ""who cares, just make bombs happen. We need them to get to X""We don't care about the deaths. And the violence is endless. Just be prepared to watch people you don't care about and know nothing about die constantly.The show skips from one scene to the next like a baboon with ADD. And that is the major difference between a good show like Twin Peaks and a waste of time like Fallout. We aren't forced to deal with ANY unwanted or uneasy emotions for any significant period of time in Fallout. Just think about that for a minute because part of that is the exact reason why people watch TV. It's called catharsis! The concept has been around for millennia.Its not the first or best show to do anything it attempts. The humor falls flat. The ghoul is cliché. The dialogue is not memorable.. It's a blood bath. This show will make you stupid."
1	Show is good but it just feels dragged on its time for it to get canceled.
1	"Why lazy writing? Because I'm only halfway through episode 2, and half the characters (the so-called ""Oxford Five"") seem to have to decorate every sentence with the f-word. I'm no prude, but this to me is just lazy writing. Yes, you could argue it's an attempt to bring some ""reality"" to the work, but this is meant to be an epic tale of hard science and cosmic survival.The British scenes, with the Oxford Five (who are all portrayed by very self-consciously ""actorly"" types), are incredibly irritating. This typical BBC Doctor Who cheap TV dialogue, acting and directing style clashes with the more cinematic Chinese scenes set during the Cultural Revolution (which they do manage to get right).And though the source material helps carry the show (please read the books if you haven't), there's very little tension or sense of wonder generated. The Chinese show, despite being slow (or perhaps because of it) managed this much better.I'll keep watching, since I was excited when I heard about this remake, but unfortunately right from the first few minutes I knew it would be a disappointment."
1	"Candidates with tattoos who are subsequently hired must ensure that the tattoos are not visible to the public while on-duty. {LAPD Dress Code. Lapdhabbos.weebly.com/code-of-conduct.html.Granted, all cop shows are a farce when it comes to reality, but ""Lucy Chen"" would not be allowed to have unconcealed tats showing."
1	I'm happy to give 10 stars for sets, lighting, costumes, hair, sound and nature. That excited me from the start and kept me going. The world that they have visually created is very extraordinary and that's why it's worth watching the show. I don't remember the original series. However, after initial enthusiasm, I found the story more like a telenovela. There's not much of Japanese martial arts to be seen, more tiresome political dialogues. For me, most of the actors are convincing and charismatic. Unfortunately, the main actor doesn't convince me in the role. He is strangely wooden and stiff. In this respect, I have very conflicting feelings. But I'll keep watching it in the hope that the storytelling will convince me at some point.
1	The most recent season is so boring. There nothing that makes this show great anymore. Also, there isn't a good relationship in this show either.
2	"In the array of shows on Netflix, ""Baby Reindeer"" stands out as a miniseries that's hard to pin down. It goes beyond being a stalker-based series; it delves into the intricacies of trauma, isolation, and the impact of abuse on a person's mind.Throughout its duration, ""Baby Reindeer"" presents unsettling moments and discomfort, which surprisingly turns out to be the show's strengths. The show boldly ventures into the realm of psychological drama, tearing apart the facade of comfort TV to expose the side of human suffering. This miniseries is an experience that pushes viewers to confront their limits when it comes to their own thresholds for discomfort and empathy.Right from the start, ""Baby Reindeer"" throws viewers into Donny's world portrayed by the real-life Donny---Richard Gadd.The first episode introduces Donny in all his complexity laying the groundwork for what seems like a story of decisions and questionable actions at first glance. However as the series progresses layers of Donny's character are gradually unveiled, revealing a grappling with a profound deep-seated trauma. The show doesn't shy away, from immersing its audience in an exploration of its character. The narrative structure, which is both immediate and relentless, refuses to coddle its viewers, instead opting for a raw portrayal of its characters. This approach creates an impact; it's alienating yet strangely captivating, immersing viewers in a world where characters feel both authentic and flawed. The brilliance of the show shines through its exploration of trauma and its lasting effects.As the series unfolds, the protagonist, initially portrayed as someone testing our patience with their choices, gradually reveals layers of his complexity. What once irked viewers now sparks curiosity as each episode delves deeper into the characters' psyche unveiling past traumas that shape their actions. By the 4th episode, Donny's hidden pain resurfaces, shedding light on his puzzling decisions. The show sensitively navigates the aftermath of abuse, depicting the burden of guilt and shame that the survivors experienced. Donny's vulnerability becomes palpable forcing audiences to confront how abuse can distort one's self-identity. What starts as subtle tension erupts into an exploration of the protagonist's struggles. The way trauma is shown in the story is subtle and integrated naturally becoming a part of the character's journey.Richard Gadd's performance as Donny is truly remarkable. He skillfully combines heartbreak and humor bringing a depth to the character that stays with you even after the movie ends. It's quite remarkable to see someone relive their trauma like Richard Gadd did; it was his experience and his bravery, in sharing and retelling it is admirable. Gadd's nuanced acting ensures that there's a touch of humanity shining through in Donny's questionable moments. His ability to bring lightness into situations speaks volumes about resilience even when faced with immense pain. On the other hand, Jessica Gunning steals the spotlight with her portrayal of Martha. Playing a stalker and compulsive liar, Martha evokes a mix of emotions from the audience. Gunning delivers a performance that triggers both sympathy and frustration towards Martha. Her character's unsettling presence serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities of mental illness and obsession. Martha's character is designed to get under your skin and Gunning pulls this off with such precision.The last two episodes of the show are truly outstanding, as the narrative threads that have been carefully laid out come together in a poignant and cathartic climax. The audience's understanding of Donny's choices and the slow reveal of his deep-seated trauma culminate in a realization of the gravity of his situation. His hesitation to report Martha, a choice that may have seemed unjustifiable before, is put to light leaving viewers with a sense of understanding of his predicament. The final two episodes provide a glimpse into each character's motivations and the enduring impacts of Donny's trauma. When Donny's vulnerabilities are exposed, it creates a gut-wrenching moment that compels viewers to face the extent of his suffering.At its heart, ""Baby Reindeer"" contemplates the repercussions of loneliness and abuse and through Donny's journey, the show delves into the isolation that often accompanies trauma. It goes beyond stalking; it delves into the wounds that persist long after physical injuries have healed. Watching ""Baby Reindeer"" is an experience, to say the least.It's a show that might make you cringe, feel uncomfortable, and even experience secondhand embarrassment, however, beneath its exterior, it delves into the emotional and harrowing exploration of human thoughts and emotions. This miniseries moves beyond the stalker storyline to focus on the effects of abuse and the isolating impact of solitude. The show's strength lies in how it handles topics with care and doesn't shy away from portraying the darker sides of its themes. What sets the show apart is the unflinching commitment to exposing social realities. The show holds up a mirror to society's often simplistic understanding of trauma and its aftermath. It challenges the notion that strength is an antidote to pain, instead presenting a more nuanced view of the human condition-one filled with layers of guilt, shame, and vulnerability.In summary, ""Baby Reindeer"" is an addition to Netflix's collection of thought-provoking dramas. It demands attention not for its daring storytelling but for the conversations it ignites about the invisible struggles many people endure. It leaves an indelible mark on viewers, serving as a powerful reminder of the complexities of trauma and the resilience required to confront it. This series goes beyond entertaining; it teaches, empathizes, and raises the bar for storytelling. Its portrayal of trauma, isolation, and the impact of abuse is honest and intense. Richard Gadd and Jessica Gunning deliver performances that bring their characters to life. If you're willing to confront the uncomfortable and delve into the depths of human emotion, ""Baby Reindeer"" is a journey worth taking."
0	I have managed to watch almost 4 seasons so far. I really don't know if should I watch it more, because I can't stand Meredith. She is main actress in show and she is so damn annoying, ridiculous, spoiled, childish, annoying, annoying, ANNOYING! There is not a single thing that is good about her. She's always complaining and she thinks she is the only person that matters and that she is the only one with problems. She loves to rant about her problems more then anything else. She is braking up with Derek for the most impossible stupid ridiculous reasons. And then she's telling him he must not date other women, because some day after decade maybe she will be ready to have something more with him. WHAT THE HELL!?Also, if I would decide to watch all seasons I'm pretty sure I would see everyone in the hospital sleeping with each other at some point. In season 8 there are probably patients screwing each other.
2	It has been proven in the past that the high potential of Japanese culture has made its way to the cinema and television of the worlds, and this series has reminded us of this just one more time what this culture has to offer.I've been waiting to see this series since I saw the trailer, which I think was worth the wait. In the first episode, saplings were planted, but the fruits of those saplings weren't seen in the final episode. At first, the viewer's expectations were very high; As much as the Japanese version of Game of Thrones, but at end it was not like that.In spite of the fact that media advertisements exceeded our expectations, it was a pleasant experience. Thanks for all.
0	Will all the wonderful equipment available which could have enhanced the story, the cinematography is wasted or even lack there off.Why on earth shot in black and white? The forceful performances fail to captivate and engage.There's no allure not enraging visuals, why make a series like this? Is best to listen to an audiobook.I suppose some will say it's gutsy and avant-garde to film this way. Sorry thanks but no thanks. With all the choices available this series fails miserably and would imagine fans of the book and movie, will no doubt be utterly disappointed. Put your attention elsewhere, this series is a lemon.
2	The last four seasons were a great downgrade to what otherwise might have become the greatest show of all time. Coincidentally, it's all around the same they ran out of book material haha
0	The CGI is decent, same for the fight scenes. However, the plot is quite weak, the pacing was very slow, after a while I had to start skipping some scenes.I was really excited when this show was announced given the success of Halo series, I was expecting something similar. This really fell short.I want to believe all the positive reviews are from people who have played the games and are already aware of the backstory. For people like me who haven't played the game yet, the show doesn't do anything to explain the characters or to make you care about anything.Just a dull drawn out movie, with lousy characters. Except the ghoul guy, he really tried to bring life to the movie.
0	No one in this show seems like an actual person. Every single character is a bad parody with unbelievable, and not uncommonly nonsensical, dialogue.The casting is hit or miss. I like some of the actors for their roles but others seem out of place.Production value is quite good. Even the more mundane scenes are well shot. The way scenes are framed, the lighting, the cgi all look great. Whoever handled the filming deserves major props.The plot seems poorly portrayed. I haven't read the book but can't imagine that the show gets anywhere close. There's a series of clumsy pop culture references. The weight of scenes and decisions isn't properly conveyed. The progression isn't clean or comprehensive. The dynamics aren't well established.Overall, the show is not good. The source material seemed extremely interesting to me and the production value is great. The writing and characters are unfortunately...objectionable. I would have stopped after the first episode if I wasn't so invested. It didn't get easier to watch as the season went on and I won't watch any future seasons and this saddens me. =(
2	I read the books and watched one episode of the 'Three-Body Problem'. The Netflix series is quite good. Is it political? Yes, the book/show criticizes the Cultural Revolution (CR). Did the CR deserve the criticism? Yes, all the criticism it gets and more. Is the book/show anti-Chinese? No.Is Cixin Liu the greatest science fiction writer of our time? Yes, he is. By far. The books are good and the Netflix series is good. Am I a fan of Netflix? Not really. Netflix has done some really awful work. However, this series is rather good.The CR was a Chinese tragedy. It is rather sad that China's tragedy is gone from China, but all too apparent in the US.
1	Put it out if it's misery please. It's was a great show one of the best, but now it's awful. Boring boring boring!
0	In their rush to pursue other projects and their arrogance and selfishness in not handing the series over to other show runners and better writers, they ruined it.We can forgive the fact that there were so many continuity errors and stupid mistakes like coffee cups and water bottles left in scenes. I understand that things were chaotic and crew members can be forgiven.What is unforgivable is the unnecessarily furious pace, abandonment of plot points and lack of progress in key characters' arcs.Having Dany turn into the mad queen was pointless, there was no hero's redemption for Jamie, Jon Snow's revelation that he's both a Targaryen and a Stark...and then Bran the Useless becoming King?So much wasted potential.I wish these guys would never get another job in Hollywood again.
0	Dragon flew to the rescue too Quickly, Jon Snow and Daenerys sex/love happened too Quickly, Everything in the show goes too Quickly! What, they have no Money to continue GOT in a usual speed? Or actors are Tired? Or rating fell?
2	Reading the plot was enough to pull me into it but what really kept me going was Martha. Jessica Gunning nailed every bit of raw emotion and craziness of character beautifully with her eyes and expressions so as so whenever she was on screen I was awstruck. Seeing it was enough creepy but knowing that it really happened to someone leaves u thrilled. Richard Gadd also played his leading part well along with the supporting cast but I just can't appreciate Gunning enough through words. Storytelling was good and episodes were of decent length to keep you going. Background scores have all been my favourite at different times. Show has a very poetic ending, all in all its a Must Watch!!
0	Whilst the story mostly held my attention and I watched most of the episodes, I came away from watching Baby Reindeer feeling conned. Whilst I appreciate that the making of this series may have been somewhat cathartic for the narcissistic protagonist, actor, and writer, it was so self indulgent as to feel offensive to the viewer.Follow along as Donny Dun (Richard Gadd) makes every possible wrong move and bad decision in EVERY SINGLE situation, largely due to his rampant self-absorbed narcissism, and then wonders why his life is so screwed up.It comes to something when the 'victim' of one of the most bonkers stalkers you could imagine is MORE mentally unhinged than the perpetrator.Overall - some good acting, but too long, too self indulgent and not a single likeable or sympathetic character to be found.(Oh, and in this series Richard Gadd uses the term 'heteronormative' unironically....make of that what you will).
2	I've watched all eight episodes of Fallout and I have been pleasantly surprised. This show does a really good job of nailing the feel of the games, with it's mix of gore and wacky humour.All three protaganists are interesting to watch but I particularly liked The Ghoul, who had a strong backstory, and the Vault Dweller, who's naivety made for quite a few laughs.The locations in the show were styled on the game and were true to the game. Although, they were all smaller locations. There were no wanderings in large, destroyed cities. I guess that would have meant a bigger CGi budget, so it's understandable.Also, it would have been nice if there was more danger in the wasteland created by the multitude of creatures from the game. This felt a bit neglected in the show. Again, I suspect this would have added to the budget. Perhaps these small quibbles could be rectified in Season 2. Surely there will be a Season 2 as this first season is surely going to be a success.I absolutely loved the way the plot threads came together in the last episode. It was really satisfying and leaves room for the story to continue.One last point. I've played and been a fan of all the games over the past few decades and find the 1-star reviews from fans of the game to be very strange. What are your expectations? You have to give the writers the chance to tell a story about characters in the Fallout World and they've done that very well. The set designers, costume artists, etc have nailed the style too, so how can this be a 1-star show? Insanity!
1	The show is honestly a good watch if you want something light hearted. But after season 2 the show just falls of so hard, and by season 4 i couldnt watch more. Why am i watching patrol cops trying to rescue a kidnapped police officer in another country, its just to surrealistic and there is many times in all seasons it feels kinda silly. Like why are rookie patrol cops leading cia house break ins, etc.. i also just wanna point out that at times i feel like the show is just to political correct. The head of the patrol cops is just so perfect no matter whats happen'd or the tookies as doing and towards the end its kinda sickening.
1	She adds no value. She's a terrible actress. And I am just over her.
1	Everything in this serial is portrayed under a woman's fantasy. All men behave as most women ideally imagine behaving in similar situations. Usually the bad guy or the unstable is a man. All the woman are strong independent young and beautiful and have friendly relationships with other womens strong and meaningful for many many years. Also the sexual and ethnicity diversity is so abnormal and completely fictional even with the standard of United States. Maybe because of all the both reasons this serial is so popular.
0	Do something better with your instead of watching this show. Bad acting worse storyline
1	The show started out good for seasons 1 and 2. Season 3 got too woke and political... and season 4 has improved a little but don't get me started on the character of Bailey Noonan (Fillions characters girlfriend) Lack of chemistry and credibility of all the things this woman is supposed to be ( firefighter, national reserve etc) is too stupid. This actress (Jenna Dewan) can't act to save her life! Absolutely hate her!Fillions acting is nothing new. He's the same persona in most of his work. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved his character and show Castle!The storylines and acting of the supporting actor are so much better.And they keep inviting really unlikable guest stars in very implausible roles! Like Niecy Nash! Jeez she is so annoying! The 2 episodes she was in were really excruciating to watch! This is what ruins the show for me!
1	"Final Episode:If these producers and their production team is going to take on Star Wars for Disney, expect hope filled promos and absolutely saccharin fulfillment. After Jon Snow kills off Daenerys at the simple behest of Tyrion and the dragon burns the evil throne, I had had enough. The dragon took out it's angst by burning a chair? Pleeeeeease! These writers and producers should be fined and jailed for misappropriation of creativity under the guise of story telling. JRR must be fuming as are all who followed what turned out to be a mass of misdirection, bad writing and sophomoric plot lines that mostly went nowhere.Here are a couple of glaring examples: Arya Stark is on a mission to kill the queen. Plot line forgotten. Jon Snow is really a Targarian. Plot line forgotten. Bram, who can't be a ruler because he's the 3-eyed crow and can see everything, suddenly becomes the ruler because he can't have kids? Plot line forgotten and twisted to get an ending that didn't lead people to expect anything more. There are other Starks but Sansa is queen of the north? Horrible outcome. Arya goes on an adventure to the West just because no one has ever gone there before? In Westros, the world must be as flat as the flat-earther's say it is because one would suspect she's going to fall off the edge. What happened to the Citadel? They were the only guys to get it right: They had been there for thousands of years and had survived the Ice Walkers before. Why would Samwell ever think the world would end if they didn't do something? Indeed, the Ice Walkers went down rather easily at the hands of a young girl who had a great character stripped from her by absolutely stupid, egotistical producers and writers who were looking to get out of this thing while leaving the prospects for spin-offs. What a colossal joke on what could have been a real theatrical and artistic statement.The show ends with Jon going off with the Wildlings who he had befriended and saved for the most part, from the Ice Walkers. Here's how the show should have ended:Sansa Stark heads north with soldiers she brought. Arya killed Daenarys and is exiled so she is sent to the West where supposedly boogy-men and monsters exist. Jon goes back to the wreck of Ft. Black, discovers it's a total mess and heads off with the Wildlings.Then Tyrion and the others sit down at a boring meeting and try to figure out how to rebuild Kings Landing and manage crops, what's left of the military and how to run the day-in-day-out operations of a large society of people interdependent on each other. Somebody is going to have to clean up and get rid of all the bodies and restore a semblance of sanity so people can repopulate. Food has to come from somewhere and it's important to get those brothels going again. That would have been fitting. Forty-five minutes of a tedious business meeting to cap off two seasons where no creativity took place and where producers and writers were so out of their league that a 13-year old middle school student could have done better.I'm going to take a segue here to the battle with the Ice Walkers. Here is the beginning of the battle. Daenarys has allowed the Dothraki (sp) to be in the front lines. They are going to charge at the Army of the Dead estimated to be some 500K strong. Nobody thinks to have any kind of strategy. They rush off into battle with creatures who can't be killed and if they get killed themselves, come back as soldiers in the Dead Army. So let them rush headlong into the fight as if this is going to accomplish the ultimate goal of getting the Ice Walker King in front of Bram who is bait that the Ice Walker King can't resist because he touched him once?The only thing affirmed by this battle and many of the others fought was the absolute superiority of Air Power agains light infantry of any kind. Overall, whoever stages those battles should be fined for misrepresentation of skill.Penultimate Episode:I don't have any idea what the writers and producers were thinking. It must have been something like this: ""Hey, we've made a lot of money so far so let's pull the plug on any creative idea or concept of conflict resolution, pocket our cash and get out of Dodge before the stupid audience figures out that we are totally ripping them off.Somehow, the creative side of this series managed to take a compelling story with some minor episodic flaws that left me groaning and turned the series into a woman's year memorial into how insipid are men around powerful women.This series has turned into a colossal joke and parody of itself. One striking moment had Brothers fighting it out similar to the light saber scenes from ""Revenge of the Sith.""They somehow managed to turn one of the more compelling female roles, that of Arya Stark into a weak screaming little girl faced with her own mortality. Gone is the revenge-seeking heroine who slayed the Ice Walker King and Walter Frey and all his kind and survived the ego-bruising initiation into the so-called ""league"" of assassins and who survived endless situations that would have driven most people mad, like loosing her sight and the beheading of her own father. Now we find that the creative non-geniuses in charge of character development have managed to stick her into the Devolvement machine from ""Mario Bros."" and eliminate all her life experience and reduce her to a sniveling little girl running for her life. It's not only bad conceptually but insulting.Forget that there is not one whit of military strategy that could win any battle and people survive in situations they shouldn't. Jaime should have died several times and dead come back to life in Westros but that's episodic TV. It's medieval ""Supernatural"" in the foolish plot contrivances. But that can be forgiven.What can't be forgiven is turning a good, compelling story into a ""Dungeons and Dragons"" remake without the humor of the original. I watched with some degree of expectation that the developers of such characters as Samwell and the Lanisters could resolve the potential final battles with some degree of sophistication. But, alas, they didn't and they have played a colossal joke on a pretty devoted audience.I rate this five starts because before these last two seasons, a pretty good story was unfolding and that kept me and a lot of people watching. All I can ask is: ""What the hell happened?"""
2	Grey's anatomy is, maybe, the best program about doctors that I have seen. It has an agile and very entertaining pace. It is incredible since the rarest cases of the medicine happen inside the hospital. The dialogues also are intelligent with a fabulous dose of humor to enjoy during a complete hour the program.The better thing is the personal drama of the protagonists, headed by Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), his relation with Shepherd; but, in my personal taste, I prefer the pretty Izzie (KatherineHeighl) that can be so charming as unbearable.Brilliant!
2	"At the beginning, I didn't think I would like this show. I've been a daytime (and night-time, in the 80's) soap fan of long standing, and was getting off on Desperate Housewives, when GA came on the screen. At first glance, it seemed like yet another lame attempt at ""diversity"" for diversity's sake and besides, who needed yet another medical drama?But.Like a train wreck, I couldn't take my eyes off the scene. The acting seemed competent, as did the directing, yet there was clearly something more at work here. It took a few weeks before I actually watched an entire episode from start to finish, and soon after, GA joined the must-see list and was added to my weekly DVR rotation.Simply put, this show brings out nearly every emotion that television is capable of conjuring up. It's been described as a medical soap, and yes, that is accurate, but it goes beyond that. As with a soap, we start to care more and more about the characters, and each one is well fleshed out. Even newcomers can join the cast and are quickly grafted onto the whole. The level of drama has reached some incredible heights, what with the ""code black"" double episode of a few weeks back. You start to wonder if they can top themselves. Somehow, I think they will. The season finale promises to do just that. If you are new to GA, I suggest you record this show before viewing. The dialog and action sometimes moves at a frenetic pace and you will miss key elements if your mind wanders even for ten seconds.At this point, I cannot imagine my television viewing without Meredith, Yang, Burke, Shepard, O'Malley, Bailey, et al. Far beyond merely competent actors, they seem like old friends after less than a year. ABC has created something wonderful here. I just hope it can last."
0	It had a slow start, after 10 min it kicked in.I love it. New exciting mix of police series genres like buddy cop, hard boiled, even romcom.Likeable characters. Comeback of the good policeman we knew from the past and got lost....
2	Awesome show throughout. Liked all the seasons equally although nudity was not needed as much as it's shown. Otherwise everything in show was good. Good action, good graphics, good location and good acting by all the actors. Please don't make a sequel or spin off and spoil the original
2	This series captures a man with his own demons and internal struggles who meets a woman in a bar who he pity's and because he is a true empath he is kind to her, she saw that kindness and was immediately drawn to him, due to her own mental illness she became so fixated on him.Later on he realises that he understands her because he has similar pain to her, they were both troubled souls, although he doesn't love her and feels anger for what she's done to his life, he somehow feels a strange connection that he is surprised at himself and doesn't understand.There is so much depth and emotion under the pain. Such a great show.
2	Good at the beginning  Amazing around season 4-5 until season 11-12 after it's just boring and just for money  Also in the last seasons there are just too many characters so there are not anymore special relationships between them because they focus like on 2-3 characters each episode
1	As a fan of the game's the first thing I want to say the story was better than Fallout 4, but the characters did not leave much of an impression they were too bland except for The Ghoul and Lucy the rest were very forgettable, but The Ghoul really left an impression like he was a veteran from the games and Lucy was like someone first time playing but in a good way.They captured the feel of the world of Fallout exceptionally well, even the weapons which I wished to see more from the games but what they didn't capture very well were the monsters of fallout that felt lacking to me at least also the lack of a deathclaw was very disappointing to me.The Last Episode was kind a weird to me with the whole revelation stuff and the part with who dropped the bombs just felt like stupid writing to me and wished they just stuck to the lore.
2	Loved everything about it! Ella Purnell is brilliant and carries the show. Her fellow cast supports her in the amazing performance that she gives as they too feed off of her energy and give an amazing view into this enthralling story. I couldn't wait for her scenes, as Lucy made every moment a life changing step in her journey. Great story. Captivated at the very beginning. The characters instantly draw you in making the series that much more intense. I've never played the video game (I'm 49) but I see the appeal and would love to try and play. I love when Lucy keeps getting called Goosey. Such a great comedic relief to the intensity of the action packed scenes. I've already recommended to all my friends, who replied that they too had started watching the incredible new series. I can't wait to see what happens next.
0	This looks and feels like a parody or comedy, but it is really boring and lame. The non-stop songs from the 1940s makes it painful to listen to this garbage.I fast-forward through most of it, since it is one of those shows that fills up time by showing you someone walking every step from one place to another, so you can fast-forward a minute or two so they can get where they are going faster.Looking at the big eyes and goofy face of Vaultgirl is another downer. There used to be a TV series that featured a mongoloid kid. He could make that look work.A lot of the characters are just dysfunctional and pointless. There is not much going for this show, except the Ghoul, and he is just a standard chaos character.Whenever the annoying 1940s songs start playing, I put it on mute. Most of the dialogue is lame. This show is based on a video game, so dialogue is not a priority. You can guess most of it from just watching, and thus avoid listening to the horrible music.The music is all cheerful love songs and other cheerful stuff from the 1940s, so I guess it is meant to be sarcastic or cynical view of the post-Apocalypse. I guess most of that music is in the public domain, and that is why it is being used (for free). There are lots of cheerful songs from the 1970s, 1980s, etc. That would not be so annoying, but those are not free.
1	Idk how to describe it properly, but since the original casts were gone, the show was getting worse. The storyline is boring. There's nothing new like the old seasons. I remember very excited watching every new episode, I miss that feeling. You need to get Christina, Izzie, Arizona, Kepner, Callie back on the show. Or new casts. and hopefully their characters are being developed. Btw, Link and Shepherd relationship is probably the most boring thing I've ever seen in a movie.
0	Season 8 is terrible! I hated it! I can't believe we waited for this!
1	"The first few years were AMAZING! It has sort of trickled down to OK and now I watch it more out of curiosity than anything else. To NOT give anything away, the main character, Meridith Grey, went from being this very dynamic believable flawed sort of a person that you could relate to and you wanted to see succeed. Now, she is this perfect surreal person that everyone idolizes that spews hokey nonsense and has somehow become extremely annoying in that she is blah and dull and boring. She lost all of her quirk and uniqueness and you long for the days when she seemed human and flawed and likeable.In the first few seasons, there were main characters that, while a bit stereotypical, had these flaws that made you sort of root for them to succeed.Now, you want the characters to FAIL because they are no longer likeable...they have become annoying and either so boringly predictable or SO unrealistic that it has become very hard to watch.Medically, you will CRINGE as the show does a HUGE disservice to people with actual illnesses like Traumatic Brain Injuries as it makes it appear as though people heal miraculously, setting the expectation that I REAL life, that can happen, too. I would really like to see a show address what it is like to have to deal with the REAL long term effects of some of these illnesses so the world at large stops thinking that actual people are supposed to also miraculously heal and the real world will stop getting annoyed at people who can't have these fake recoveries like they do on TV. Mis-setting expectations on what is supposed to be a ""real"" medical drama makes it difficult for actual real people sometimes."
0	"Although I appreciated learning about Japanese culture, traditions, and beautiful lands, this fell short of any of the early high rave reviews. I've given this a generous ""2"" because the writers used the word ""realm"" many times and that is my favorite word ever. Otherwise I would've rated a 1. Kudos!Now that we've watched all 10 episodes, we are let down. Throughout the season it was difficult to understand what the strategy of the end game. And in the end it didn't seem like we had an ending or even a cliffhanger. There is absolutely nothing that intrigues me to watch a Season 2. Nothing. Which is really disappointing given the amount of time we've spent watching each week."
0	Loved the 1980 adaptation. But I really struggled to watch this version. I am not a fan of subtitles as I find that too many give me a headache I also find that by having to read the subtitles that I am unable to properly view the scenes on the screen so because of this I will not be watching any more episodes.Many people have rated this program excellent but it's not for me unfortunately.I was looking forward to watching this so I am disappointed that it has not met my expectations.In fact it's an hour of my life I will not back.This is just the opinion of myself and my husband I hope that anyone watching it will come to their own conclusions.
0	I was enjoying this shows actors and storylines until the show started shoving anti gun rhetoric down my throat by portraying legal gun owners as unhinged bigots. Shame on you
1	This is beautifully shot and an interesting storey, what I cannot get over though constant stair shots. Man walks up man walks down man walks back up man walks down. This could have been an amazing 4 part re telling of an amazing story. But my word it was dragged out.Whilst there are no real shockers the acting is good and real tension is built and you enjoy the story unfolding. But the repetitive shots or back and forth and back and forth gets tiresome.I think you'd be better off watching the Matt Damon version and savings 8 hours of your life.you find your self wanting to skip chunks to get to the end.
0	"Let me tell you something. I've never read the books and I don't intend until GRRM finish all this damn books, If one day he will do it. I watched all the seasons up to now, and I intend to finish it, but even much I enjoy the show, I can't deny that the story taken certain directions that disappointed and displeased me.In the first half of show, the story had great twists and episodes really memorable and awesome as Ned's death, the battle of BlackWater, the Red Wedding and all the exciting fourth season. Unfortunately, there was a decline of certain characters in lasts seasons. Daenerys was an incredible character in beginning as a conqueror, but after she took power in Meeren, she's simply annoying now. All plot in Meereen was boring. And what about Tyrion? After he fled from Casterly Rock, his story seems to have lost its charm. The hard truth is that he's now just the shadow of the man he was. He was terribly wasted in the last seasons having been reduced to a mere comic relief. Arya, in particular, what the hell she did in the last two seasons, I cannot say. Her excellent and entertaining interaction with The Hound gave way to a boring and wtf training in Braavos, and the show lost a lot with that. About Dorne, I don't even need to comment. Was ridiculously ridiculous.As for the end of Stannis, I don't know what to comment either. The character had one of the worst plot outcomes I've ever seen. And Rickon Stark? He died as he lived: being totally useless. And even when the show was at its best, there have always been some freaking stupid and bizarre things that sound too exaggerated and out of place in story, which has a more crude and realistic tone in itself. I can easely accept the dragons and the ""mediumistic"" Bran Stark abilities why they fit into a medieval universe. But I can't stand Melisandre giving birth a freaking shadow that killed a Guy and then disappears like smoke. What? And there are the Zumbies and the arrival of the white walkers, that I never give a damn.This army of Ice Zumbies often feels shifted from realistic political universe in GoT. Seriously, this plot sucks.The positive points is that stories of Jon Snow, Sansa and Bran became much more interesting in the last seasons by far. It's cool to see Jon Snow standing in his rightful position and Sansa finally standing up for herself. Bran's character, by the way, has finally gained some meaning for me now. I hated him until season six, now I really like him. Hodor's death was touching and surprising. The Battle of the Bastards was epic. So, not everything displeased me.I don't know if season seven and eight will be able to lift the fun and surprises that were the first half of Game Of Thrones. The show feels somewhat lost amid so many changes, and seems to feel the weight of having lost so many interesting characters along the way."
1	Anything after season 6 is just bad. Season 8 was a waste and lack of anything remotely cathartic. It's one thing to try to subvert expectations but you have to have to writing to back it up. But hey I guess it doesn't matter when you get tapped for a Disney project right?
1	Having started watching this, it didn't start off too badly. But got worse.The original premise of Nathan Fillion's character being older and getting his head round to eventually becoming a fully fledged officer sounded good and his character's ability to being somewhat a 'people's person' able to to sympathise and clearly has an instinct for seeing trouble as shown in the opening episode seemed like a good start.Issues with characters and writing: Alyssa Diaz's playing the typical angry latina and constantly pouting with her lips looked worse, especially now she's older. Titus Makin jnr was another person always pouting at every opportunity.Have you noticed in these modern shows it's always the same line being used 'I'm so sorry...' or 'I'm so sorry...' which sounds boring as hell, when seen many times across multiple tv shows etc.By the time you get to S3, you can see the dumb pairing a mile off. The way they wrote Melissa O'Neil's character where she's clearly playing a younger ditzy type with the playful cute nonsense got tiresome especially during more serious situations - her character's psychology and chemistry knowledge wasn't utilised enough and constantly looking for validation, just got boring and as others have pointed out during the episodes where her character is kidnapped there's weird writing choices with her trying to escape...All the female characters are written as bad ass, where as, unless they are snr or commanding officers, males are written as dimwits.Good Stuff: Some of the music during the more serious scenes with the low thumping synth/bass were pretty good, but just these parts.Some of the tactical stuff for a modern police show wasn't bad, specifically the weapons usage and movement was good to see, however there were odd choices with cover (coming out of cover that were strange.Episode 8 was great as examination of Nathan Fillion's character's mindset (yes, maybe not following all the correct details as some have pointed out, but gave enough feel from a filmic point of view).The veteran guest stars were great too see (not always about young pretty people); Matthew Glave as the sneaky offender alway looking for a deal or favours, his voice and supporting character acting are solid in the episodes he's in. Annie Wersching was really standout as the serial killer and her cat and mouse games with Nolan and team.Couldn't be bothered with it by S4, stopped watching.
1	Shogun is one of my all-time-favourite novels, but this is so wildly divergent from the original text that it can barely claim to be an adaptation. With all the money that Disney have thrown at it, which is undoubtably visible in the lush production values, it is a shame that they didn't spend more on a better scriptwriter. All the nuance of the original source has been lost. I can accept that TV is different from literature and that some elements need to be cut or curtailed, but here they have excised huge, vital swathes of the original; they kill off major characters who aren't supposed to die at all, and have imbued others with personalities entirely at odds with who they should be. I cannot lay any blame at the feet of the generally excellent cast (except the woefully miscast Cosmo Jarvis), but this is so confusingly and shamefully at odds with the source that it makes me almost yearn for the Richard Chamberlain version. If you want to see feudal Japan done better/properly watch 'The Last Samurai' or, better still, the sublime 'The Seven Samurai'. This is a disgracefully inaccurate adaptation of a vast, sweeping novel. Disney should be shamed.
2	When I started watching I fell in love with all the characters but once they start leaving, I just feel it's so heartbreaking, yeah they have a life outside the cast but I really hope they could freeze world wide time and let all the casts continue. From the beginning of the show to the grey Sloan 6 was the most amazing episodes of the movie for me. Really wish all characters that exist the show do not die but rather instead relocate to a different city which would be great. A big thanks to grey's anatomy mermer, mcdreamy, Yang, karev, little grey, sloan, Amelia, lizzy, Weber, kepner, Avery, Catherine, O'Malley, Miranda, Torres, robbins., Addison, Burke, bokhee.
0	Not only did the book suck, but so too does the series.The most convoluted and nonsense stuff happens.It really writes science from a perspective of not actually knowing science, so I don't understand why people love that aspect.It has some great scenes, done really well. Some interesting concepts, as with the books. But again, drops the ball with convoluted characters, poor understanding of science by thinking of itself smarter than what it is (the books were nauseating with this), and most annoyingly putting people forward as either smart or highly capable in their own right, then systematically making them act like a stupidest person to ever exist.Both wanting to paint 'intellectuals' as the best we have, but needing them to be drooling levels of dumb so that the plot can even continue in the first place.Benedict Wong is great. Honestly he was perfect casting, and nails my favourite character from the book at least. It's a Hollywood cast, and he is great.So too is Liam Cunningham. The two of them work really well, and are great when they come into their own.Side note, the Kiwi girl playing Jin Cheng mumbles so much, I'm so happy we have subtitles on.
1	No doubt this is the best tv show with the worst end ever !! Really was disappointing for all audiences
0	Game of thrones spent all the time creating character arcs, building up the white walkers and world building, only for season 8 to come along and render all of that for nothing. For example they spent all this time building up Jon Snows secret birthright as a Targaryen, only to have it be for nothing. Dany, protector of the weak suddenly (and I do mean suddenly) hears some bells and a switch flips in her head. Oh and Bran can warg but he does nothing with it. But ends up becoming king. There's way too much and the writers clearly wanted to finish up this show in a hurry so that they could go work on star wars. Congrats, you ruined your cash cow. There is absolutely no reason to rewatch this series now.
1	In that it's totally unbelievable, but very enjoyable.There is almost zero corruption, they don't shoot dogs for no reason, they don't constantly claim to be in fear for their lives, 2-3 gun fights every episode, they are not obese, and they don't try to escalate every interaction.But it's very watchable. The Ebola scare in episode 20 was a bit much tho IMO.7.5/10
1	The quality of this show is much better than expected. I have always loved Nathan Fillion in whatever he is in but this casting I'd superb in many ways. I want me a Tim Bradford but to be honest from the first couple of seasons. They have softened his character too much, in my opinion, and I am not entirely in love with his Romance with Chen. I think they delayed it at the wrong times and in more recent episodes it seems more forced. I believe the West family was done a grave disservice. I know the actor didn't want to come back but his reasons were unfounded in that his whole character build was about him being a black cop and changing the system, so it made no sense. He wasn't my favorite character but to kill him off so passively just did not seem right. I didn't even get to feel the heart break or cry. Just breezed right past it, then I guess because of the actor choice another terrific actor lost his job. I mean where is Captain West, IA isn't as important now or what? I also feel like there is no real fighting in the relationships, even your badass detectives get over a fight so quickly. Relationships aren't that easy and people aren't that forgiving. Smitty is a Gem of laziness and I am here for it. The newer cast are good but I almost feel like they went one direction with them and did a 180 and not necessarily in a good way, I hope the writers see this. I am not a fan of Fillions romance per say, it's hit and miss for me, I think its the chemistry is there one shot and gone the next. I can't wait to see what happens next. Overall I think the show is a winner. It's funny and dynamic, but can also bring a tear to your eye. I hope it continues with this formula and doesn't go completely left, maybe more drama with the relationships and how well people do the job. Well done to the show.
2	"Andrew Scott give another remarkable performance in this very fleshed out remake of the Talented Mr. Ripley. It's shot in glorious Black and White and you will see some remarkable shots and some cinematography that will make you say ""Wow"". Watching this I could not help but feel like Zaillian was going after an Alfred Hitchcock vibe and he has done it perhaps as good as I've ever seen it be done before. The supporting cast also shines. I think Dakota Fanning almost always does a great job and this is no exception. This series just looks and feels great. This is perhaps the very best adaptation of this great novel to date. I Know a lot of folks liked the Matt Damon version, but this surpasses that one by quire a bit."
0	The show has become so fake and ridiculous its frustrating. I can't even watch it anymore, I wish they would consult some physicians or somthing because they say and do things that are not real or used the wrong way and would never work. Like the other day a doctor said the ABC's are clear lol the airway breathing and circulation is clear like okay.
0	This show started off great. I was impressed with the uniqueness, plots, excitement that kept me on the edge of my seat, and the character development. Seasons 1 and 2 were great, season 3 was meh and season 4 is terrible. For some reason the show decided to dump the quality content and replace it with every political, and woke theme it could. I'm tired of shows shoving political views down our throats at every turn. Season 4 will be my last, I'm only hanging on for Lucy and Bradford and it is barely tolerable.
0	I can't exactly enjoy the scenes when I'm too busy looking at the bottom of the screen 60% of the time. The trailer was not like this.Other than that that it's fine. I love the protestant and catholic rift. I like the costumes and architecture. And I feel like I'm learning about japenese culture. I like fact checking after every episode. I learn a lot but it's just too much to digest. This show is too complicated and has too much talking in it for me to enjoy it with subtitles. Maybe if it was an action packed anime or a movie, but 10 hours of reading. Might as well just read the book! Too bad I was looking forward to it too.
0	How David Benioff and D. B. Weiss continue to get jobs is both fascinating and beyond the pale.It takes a special kind of mediocrity to be given the unique opportunity to adapt one of the greatest sci-fi books of our generation and reduce it to this quintessential, mindless Hollywood garbage.Character development? Zero. Western adaptation? Sophomoric, clumsy and cringeworthy. Script? Mundane and uninspired. Pacing? Rushed to no end (you basically get half of the first book in 30 minutes).Look, there already is a Three-Body Problem TV show. Granted, it's from China, so there are many stylistic differences that aren't going to work for everyone, but it honors the source material, it gives both characters and story time to breathe and room to grow with the audience. It's a little slow and it doesn't have the panache or photography of a Hollywood production, but it's light years better than this.Do yourself a favor and do not watch this travesty.
0	Fallout is based on a video game that I have not played, and know nothing about, so I am probably not the target audience for this show. However, I do like scifi, and the premises sounded interesting, and it is, taking place in a post-apocalyptic world.The show is decently done, and visually it looks good, the budget must be substantial. The acting is decent, and the show is a mixture of three themes, the 50s, cowboys and future-esque. It is interesting to see these mixed together, but at the same time they don't really properly mix, but just co-exist mostly separately.The storytelling is very much from the school of video games, in the way that the characters are sort of introduced separately, then a lot of information is listed, and then they go on a quest. It didn't particularly appeal to me nor capture my attention, as a person who does not play a lot of video games. (Though The Last of Us was able to do this very successfully for non-gamers in my opinion.)The characters are flat. The main character, Lucy, is kind of annoying and unrelatable, with her completely unrealistic naivite and blind optimism. She doesn't really feel like a whole character, but just some form of male fantasy. Maximus is even worse, he's so flat and without any character trades that he doesn't even manage to be annoying. The Ghoul has charisma, and is interesting, but doesn't get enough screentime to hold up the show on his own.There are no interpersonal relationships formed really, in the first episodes of the show. It's just three separate characters, occasionally meeting but mostly just interacting and fighting with various NPCs, which is very boring to me, as a non-gamer. So it is very difficult to keep the attention.Finally, for me, the absolute worst part is the soundtrack. It feels very forced, deliberate and pretencious. 50s songs are forced onto scenes where most of the time they make no sense, preventing me from falling into the story. Then the songs suddenly stop and the feel of the scene instantly changes (because it never fitted with the 50s music to begin with), making the storytelling very discontinuous, especially in relation to the feel of the story, and emotions conveyed in each scenes. The future-esque music that is used for fighting scenes and exciting storypoints is very slow and depressing, and does the opposite of making me engaged in this story. So overall the soundtrack is just very annoying and/or boring to me, overbearing to the point that it rips my attention away from the story. (An exception of this is Johnny Cash, obviously, as Johnny Cash is almost always a good choice). From what I hear, though, this is a fundamental part of the Fallout-verse, and the music has so much of a presence, and its own character (peraps too) independent from the tv show that I am sure some people will love it.I admit this is written after only watching three episodes, so maybe it does get better. I just can't watch more of this show to find out.Overall, this is not a bad show. It was just not for me (which is Ok) and is probably more catered to fans of Fallout, and video games in general.
2	"I don't think I've ever reviewed anything on IMDB before (though it said I had a login so it's possible I created one and never went through with a review for something years ago), but I was compelled to write a review for Ripley. It is one of the most beautifully filmed shows or movies I have ever seen, and the acting is just about as good. You honestly don't even notice it's in black and white, there's such richness and thought behind what is shown. I could end this review with that, but I'll continue. If I had started it earlier in the day, I would have finished all of the episodes the same day, but I took two days. After the first few episodes, I was asked if it was any good, and just about all I could do was slowly nod my head up and down; I found the scenery, the music, the acting so beautiful, and I kept half-expecting the other shoe to drop and it to go downhill...It did not. I am an Andrew Scott fan, having enjoyed him in Sherlock and Fleabag (I haven't gotten to All of Us Strangers yet), but not an uber-""stan"" like many online, so I was pleased with his full embodiment of the role. His casting is absolutely spot-on; his shark-like eyes--big black pools that betray no real emotion--contain the multitude of lies that Ripley must balance. It's a master class in ""modern"" noir. I've only given it a 9 of 10 instead of a 10 for the sole reason that I fear other users will discount a 10 for being too effusive."
2	Apple TV keeps putting out great television shows and Sugar is no different. It kept me entertained the entire way through and Colin Farrell is as terrific as always as the lead. He plays John Sugar, a kind of loner who gets hired by rich people to find missing people. He's hired to find the missing granddaughter of a big time movie producer (James Cromwell) which leads him into a lot of danger and mysteries. There are plenty of good twists and mysteries to see if you can solve along the way. I'll be shocked if Farrell isn't nominated for a bunch of awards for his role in this. I don't think this is a limited series so I hope they plan on doing several seasons of this because I'm in.
1	10 out of 10 when they had the books and were just doing adaptations. Season 1-46 out of 10 when they passed the books had to depend on their own ideas which were not at all in the same league as the source material but still tried to follow it in spirit... somewhat (no Lady Stoneheart should have been a warning to the audience). Seasons 5-6.1 out of 10 when they decided it was time to wrap up the series and realized they had no idea how to resolve the characters' stories so just turned everyone into one dimensional cartoons and threw in a lot of explosions to try and distract the audience. Seasons 7-8.Sorry Star Wars fans but these are the guys you get for the next trilogy. With no one to tell them what story they are supposed to be telling.
2	Discussing how to improve policing in the US should be welcome... and it is. Thank you for making an intelligent show where nuance matters, and you don't grossly oversimplify complex issues just to make it more palatable to the unintelligent. The thinking aspect of this show is greatly appreciated.
0	"Being a real ""scientist"" I was hoping for some solid Science Fiction with a realistic story and realistic characters. When I heard people who were supposed to be scientists saying ""science is broken"" I thought this sounds like some political dig at the king of genetic mutations Dr F. But no they were idiots pretending to be scientists and speaking like drunken navvies in a whorehouse, which I find pretty insulting. So far a complete absence of science and no pretend scientist seems to have done their foundation course in metaphysics. The flashy CGI and crystal clear photography does not make up for confused mess of nothing."
0	If you are looking for erotica, watch this title. If you are looking for something meaningful, this is not worth your time. Science fiction at its ludicrous, unwatchable worst. The casting also felt suited to a work of porn. Advanced civilizations, no matter how advanced, cannot defy fundamentals laws of mechanics.The hilarious title points to the maker's utter lack of common sense or scientific acumen. It is surprising a book serves as source material for this series. I now know the book is no good. There is one character worth mentioning though - the black scientist - who seems to be the only one who talks sense.
1	I like the series and think the Japanese actors are decent but Jarvis playing the lead role has no charisma and seems lost in himself all the time.Historical errors as others already said.Why the didn't cast a better lead? I understand the maybe want a unfamiliar face but why pick one without any charisma or acting skills? The didn't have a casting? This destroys the whole serie. Why not have a lead like Colin Farrell or Robert Pattison?Except the poor leadrole the other actors try but the story is many times both rushed or felt misguided. An exemple is when the look at the sunrise and we as spectators only see the actors and no sunrise. Many things in the story is actors telling instead of showing with places and views. Could be done bettter but I gonna see it through for I like samurais.Why should You give up 10 hours of your life with these serie? I don't know really and I hope Jarvis acting gets better or I'm putting the lid om this serie.
0	I highly recommend the first few seasons. However, in later seasons the show took a departure from the medical- mystery solving and relatable characters that made it worthwhile and introduced a ridiculous amount of drama to the point where it can't be taken seriously. The death count among the staff of Seattle Grace is unbelievably high and the number of major incidents occurring each week just became laughable. The characters became annoying self- absorbed jerks, and the show became painful to watch. The later seasons completely destroyed the image of what was once a respectable medical drama series.
0	The show focused on solid plotlines that had tangible character development. Now for the third season there's a complete disconnect between the already established characters and the new preaching of Intersectionalist ideals shoehorned into the plot.I feel there's a ratio for an acceptable amount of propaganda and at this point id put this show on the same level as Veggie Tales. Sad, really.
1	The series had some solide first seasons, even though the most recent ones were not as good. The characters were solide and the medical cases were entertaining and some of them heartwarming.
1	*Written after watching the season 19 finale* Grey's Anatomy started as such an incredible show. It had heart, was clever, and really got you invested in the lives of each character. Each season got better and better for years as a world was created around our favorite hospital and cast members moved in and out of our lives. Watching an episode makes you feel that you are in the hospital, working alongside your friends. This was truly a treat to watch and I wish I could continue saying that about the current seasons. Around season 10, there became a drastic dip in quality. Many of the original cast had since left the show and were replaced with characters that had no character, just 1 or 2 qualities that ruled their existence. The writing tanked, the acting became subpar, and the characters all became shells of who they once were. It saddens me to continue watching this show as it now feels like your group of friends have all lost their minds in a disappointing manner. Each season brings my opinion on this show lower and lower and I yearn for the days before it went downhill. I would love for this show to get cancelled, just to finally put these characters to rest and stop desecrating their near decade long dead corpses. That is the most respectable thing to do at this point.
0	The first few seasons were good, i admit it. But then it spun out of control..... they added new interns and the old characters left. When the first few originals left they should have stopped it. But don't get me started on the season where Meredith Grey was in a coma from covid. I stopped after the 5th season and i suggest you do the same. It used to be a medical drama but now it's a soap opera. It's just one scandal after the next. And the actor who plays Meredith looks absolutely tired of the role. The drama is stale and it needs to just end. All of this is my opinion so please don't be offended if it's your favourite show ever.
0	"Spoilers ahead (for this and other recent movies/shows).I just finished this. I read the 1st book in the series and was very intrigued by the premise.It started out okay, with the scenes in China. All downhill from there.It makes absolutely no sense if you have enemies who know every single thing you're doing and can control seemingly everything. Why would they let us get as far as they did? Why keep us alive? How did they not know humans lie right from the beginning? How did everything get built so fast? What the heck would happen to Will's brain? Why was Saul chosen?But all this is secondary to the lack of a resolution. I'm sick and tired of movies and series ending ambiguously, either because there could be a season 2 which may never come (see Constellation); or even if there most likely will be a sequel so they have to make sure you'll come back (see Dune Part 2); or because the director says, ""It's up to you to decide what the ending means"" (see American Fiction or All of Us Strangers.) It's just ridiculous and frustrating.I don't recommend watching this."
0	The show is all but dead to me . We used to love watching it and couldn't wait for a new episode, but after the last few,, we're done.
1	Game of Thrones is LOST in season 8 as in ending of Lost Series;) Season 1-5: 10/10 Season 6: 9/10 Season 7: 8/10 Season 8: 1/10
2	This adaptation, takes some big swings. It captures the essence of the games - the dark humor, the retro-futurism, the brutal world - but the execution isn't always smooth.Nailed the Tone: The show perfectly blends the series' signature dark comedy with genuine post-apocalyptic grit. Expect laugh-out-loud moments alongside moments of genuine horror.World Building: The California wasteland feels lived-in and dangerous, filled with familiar (and mutated) creatures and callbacks to the games' lore.Strong Cast: The characters are engaging, with the protagonist's wide-eyed innocence a great counterpoint to the jaded wasteland veterans.
0	The first episode was a super ultra violent clockwork orange mess. After that it tones down a little bit and get barely watchable. However, people who love the video games, especially those who go back to Fallout 1, probably won't agree with the storyline of this.Citizens of Vault 33 are annoyingly California liberal. You would want to kill them if you were stuck underground with them. They are apologetic idiots concerned with stupid leftist garbage. The mutants in Vault 7 are preferable to the liberals even though they are doing evil experiments. At least they aren't liberal trash with mush for brains.One of the main characters (the cowboy actor who turns ghoul) starts out totally pro-American, get's talked into some communist garbage by a communist acting buddy.The whole storyline is one giant 'Capitalism is evil', 'communism is good' propaganda line of complete BS. So, that pretty much ruins the series altogether. There was no need to go down this stupid and ridiculous road. Val-tec has to destroy the world since it made the vaults and blah blah blah. Evil corporate greed destroys the world blah blah blah. And lots of empathy for the Hollywood commie crowd because of course in this story they were correct.... blah blah blah.So, the eye candy is interesting. A lot of the dialog is smut of garbage and not interesting and sometimes pointless. Story is kind of garbage really. So, the whole thing is Meh... so typical of something Hollywood (the real one in real life, not the story one) would produce and put out there. Hollywood, these days, has to ruin everything it touches includes stellar video game franchises.Watch for the eye candy if you want but it will destroy your love for the game franchise. This show makes me hate the vault dwellers.
0	I. Will. Never. Watch. This. Show. Again.It's become an hour of lecture after lecture after lecture. It's not a TV show anymore... and that's too bad... It had a good run.
0	This remake of the 80s series is excellent, but it has flaws in terms of the actors.Actor Cosmo Jarvis was poorly chosen to play the great character of Blackthorne, previously played by David Chamberlain. It lacks category, and the type of aggressive and proud representation is not even real compared to the existing novel.Yes, it's a 70s novel and it doesn't have the whole truth of the whole story. The pseudo adventures of a navigator named William Adams.And the biggest criticism is the lack of existing multiculturalism. If the series has Japanese actors representing historical figures from Japan, the same should happen with the Portuguese figures. We see Japanese being spoken, a sad and ridiculous speech in Portuguese that is in English. But then we already have an American speaking Spanish and a bunch of sailors speaking Dutch.I don't believe the series will correct or improve this issue.Keep watching...
0	Played fallout 3 and new Vegas and enjoyed them alot years ago but wouldn't call myself a diehard or purist fan so thought I'd essentially be the perfect target audience for this show.Apparently I was very very wrong.This show feels like it's trying to mimic about 5 different movies to create the effect of good TV but it misses the mark so so hard and comes across as uninspired, cheesy and so so cliche. There is not a hint of actual style or artistry in this. Every scene involves some shallow character overtly state some defining characteristic of themself (over some emotional music and maybe slow motion) before something bad happens to them which you inevitably don't care about because the character in question has no depth and the thing that happens is so hyperbolic, overly dramatic and honestly stupid that you are sat there cringing in your seat.Watched episode 1 and definitely don't feel the need to watch anymore. Jesus Christ Amazon sort yourself out.
0	I really liked the first 2 seasons. But the 2nd episode feels like the first real episode of this season because the first was the end of the second season and you can tell the narrative has changed.This show has changed from genuine optimistic trying to do the right thing. To super manipulative plots with an agendas now. These situations seem so forced and unatural.I might give this another chance but will change my review if this drastic cramming stuff down our throats changes my whole view of this show.Sorry love me some Nathan Fillion.
1	Lazy writing, lowsy script, forced dialog. Not sure why ppl are saying 10 stars. It's medium at best. Un realistic drama. The first episode. 3 bounty hunters are after a bounty but first decide to dig up a complete stranger from his grave with the hopes maybe he might help because hes been to california before. And its worth the risk and split the reward with a guy who was pretty much a goner. Let alone bounty hunters trusting a guy they dont even know .So they help him out of hos grave/prison and up getting killed for it anyways. Lol But Ok. So many Other holes in the story I dont feel like getting into. Just lazy writing.... and the knight in armor telling his squire u go check out the pitch black cave by yourself while I stand here and be a complete d*** to you while you do it. Ugh it's so bad. I'm done.
1	Was the greatest until s8 the worst of all time came is this author thinking ever that people will not accept such a bad end and scenario
1	Fallout has all the makings of a great show. It has a talented cast, a big budget, and a team of experienced writers and producers. But somehow, the show manages to be both boring and forgettable.The problem is that Fallout is all style and no substance. The characters are all one-dimensional stereotypes, and the plot is predictable and cliched. The show also suffers from a serious case of tonal whiplash, veering wildly from comedy to drama to action without any real sense of cohesion.As a result, Fallout is a show that is easy to watch but difficult to care about. You might find yourself watching an episode and then immediately forgetting everything that happened. It's the kind of show that you'll never binge-watch or even rewatch.It's a shame that Fallout is such a disappointment. With all the talent and resources behind it, it should have been a lot better. But instead, it's just another forgettable entry in the ever-growing sea of TV shows.
0	First seasons good, now it's a political narrative and trying to shove views down out throats. Personally when I come for a cop show, I expect a cop show
1	There isn't necessarily anything wrong with Grey's Anatomy, but the attention it receives is absurd. There is also nothing special about the show.The acting is fine, the stories are straight from a soap opera, and some story lines are just as unbelievable. The show is melodramatic and is really more about who is sleeping with who than it is about doctors.Overall, the show isn't bad, but it also isn't great. It is by far the most overrated show on TV, and as a result, a far superior medical show (Scrubs) is overlooked. This show is nothing special but I suppose it is addicting, if you're into over-the-top soap opera drama.
1	I start watching this show without knowing it and the S1 and S2 was just so great! Every episode was pure fun and every thing felt so real without fake policing and stuff. But than season 3 came and wow it felt like it turn into a teaching episodes, How I should feel about certain things and every second character is offended from every second word a white person says (and I'm not white). Also lots of Hypocrisy, at one moment a person say to a white guy he wont get special treatment or any ease, and on the next the same person go directly to the Sargent and asks for his help only because she knows him. I fully understand the problems with the police and profiling, but too bad they took a great show and turned it into a teaching and lessons episodes. They should continue the same as s1 and s2 which also contained profiling and stuff, but it was reasonable and subtle.
0	This show has absolutely no sense anymore.I mean it doesn't have for a long time now, but enough is enough...... ....... ............. ................
1	Grey's Anatomy is a great show. It has hundreds of episodes, tons of characters, and pretty interesting story lines. Surprisingly, they've been able to keep it up for 16 years! If you love dramas and romance, this show is where you should be. If you need a relaxing show in the evening after work, watch Grey's! I absolutely loved the show, and i'm currently watching it through for a second time. The characters you love climax in such a satisfying way. You really feel for what the characters are going through. The acting is on point, and the dialogue is fantastic.The only thing that I don't like about Grey's Anatomy is the obvious political bias. In several episodes the characters clearly state their political views in terms of a president and constitutional law.Give the show a go, it's worth it.
0	"For Patricia Highsmith, homosexuality was a metaphor for deception and the orgasmic release that comes with death. A purveyor of existential crisis and anything unconventional, her novels and stories have inspired filmmakers of a similar bent, like Hitchcock, Rene Clement, Anthony Minghella, and now Steven Zaillian.An Oscar win and nominations for his screenplays, Zaillian has moved to the long form of the Netflix serial in this black-and-white retelling of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" abbreviated to just ""Ripley,"" although clocking in at over seven hours. The added length demonstrates, as it often does, that--while exhaustive--it fails to impress without staying power.In the role of the titular, creepy chameleon, English actor Andrew Scott effects a flat, non-regional, American accent like that of a 50s television announcer, and manages, somehow, I know not how, to come off rather asexual, especially for one who earned a reputation as having played a sexy priest. His counterpart in the plot's ménage, which includes Dakota Fanning as Marge Sherwood and Johnny Flynn as Dickie Greenleaf, is an actor named Eliot Sumner who plays second victim Freddie Miles, both suspicious of Tom and a bit jealous, too--jealous of his attraction to Dickie. Males with fuzzy sexual preferences interested Highsmith, and Miles is that typical blue-blood, Ivy leaguer whose sexuality falls on a sliding scale: think William F. Buckley, and a perfect foil for Ripley. Marge, however, was always a problem for Highsmith, who understood a lesbian, but Marge is a 50s housewife-in-waiting that's neither here nor there. She, quaint American debutant, is an obstacle in this: a usual object of desire, but disposable. Her misfortune is that she isn't killed, just bypassed.As to the movie itself, Zaillian wisely keeps the action in the past where, let's face it, it belongs: without social media, Facebook, iPhones, DNA, and color (except for one brief homage to Spielberg, his mentor). The result is visually striking, but more arty than artful. And without strictly scoring his movie, relying instead on sound that comes naturally, he attempts something akin to documentary. But thrillers, which this story is, as Hitchcock knew, do not work as documentaries (he tried that only once).All of the above is just part of what's wrong with this movie. It's also drawn out to exasperation, over extended with minutiae and obscure references to Caravaggio (one indulgent, gratuitous flashback), and as slow as a how-to for the obsessive-compulsive. Thank goodness for fast forward.Ripley is the all-American psycho, an original once upon a time. But his type has been done to death, and by actual serial killers (think Andrew Cunanan) whose lives have been serialized and movieized ad nauseam. Why are such killers fascinating? Well, it's clear why they fascinate writers, directors, and actors. But audiences? Leave that to the analyst whose employment depends on it. Writers, directors, and actors are doing well enough for themselves."
0	"I used to really look forward to this show! I liked the characters and storylines; I like the relationships and how personalities clashed with or played off of one another. The season after the plane crash was the last season I actually liked. Cristina was always my favorite character, and her scene in the bathtub when she finally speaks was brilliant and dark and that monologue describing what she'd gone through was so realistic. However, it was also the season that turned my annoyance with Arizona into loathing; she became nearly unbearably awful, her self-pity and self-centeredness made me want to scream. After that season, the show just got worse. I was especially upset that Cristina's final season was filled with so much middle-school level drama and B.S. that I couldn't enjoy her character during her last episodes. That season also made Meredith into a character worth despising; her pettiness and ridiculous rivalry with Cristina (who was UNDOUBTEDLY the better surgeon, seeing as she performed Burke's surgeries while his hand was injured) was a stupid development on the part of the writers. I found myself hoping characters would die off. When Karev became the most likeable character, there was really no coming back. The old characters have become boring in all of their drama. The new characters are silly tropes with under-developed personalities and backstories. Amelia remains awful. Plot ""twists"" have become predictable -*SPOILER* who knew Meredith would end up having a baby after Derek's death?! Everyone. Everyone knew. And I was actually happy he died because Meredith's immature anger toward him over the job she encouraged him to pursue was just infuriating. His death meant at least Meredith's whining and drama was justified for a while. The show needs to end. Because I keep watching it like staying in a bad relationship...I keep hoping it will get better again despite all signs and evidence to the contrary, but I'm committed and feel the need to follow through. Bomb the entire hospital. Nuke the entire country. Make some kind of actual end with absolutely no survivors i because this show just needs to die."
1	Winter was over in one episode. Night King is the deadliest character killed in one episode.
0	Yep disappointing... and no my review isn't too shortttttr!!
2	"If you want to see proper seppuku, watch this, not ,,Harakiri"" (1962).I think this TV series is authentic and they manage to capture Japanese manners well. The creators represented 1600s with attention to detail. Even they speak in old Japanese. This production really shines with costumes, make-up and cinematography - it just pleases the eye. If you are admirer of a brutal and bloody massacre - there are a few scenes you will like.I like many things in that TV series but there are two main flaws: the story after 6 episode is bad presented: it builds very slowly and stays vague till the endmain character - Cosmo Jarvis (John Blackthorne): for me his acting is way too simple compare to others (for example without Anna Sawai and Fumi Nikaidô, whole atmosphere want be the same). Other characters are well selected.I didn't regret watching this movie."
0	You wont want to miss the first 20 minutes and then you can turn it off and never give the show another thought. I heard its got 4 story lines going on but i dont want to sit thru most of them to see one. I have never seen a show start out so great with so much potential only to crash and burn as they try to blend in some uninteresting stuff that probably only a die hard gamer could like. Well my opinion is not near as high of this show as most so maybe i should watch a few more episodes but i dont think i can bear it. LIFES TOO SHORT. Gamers probably dont know how short life is yet. I QUIT AFTER MARIO BROTHERS.
0	I hope these directors never get a big gig again. They absolutely butchered one of the greatest shows of all time. They should never have been blessed to direct this show to begin with.
1	A harsh review- Though I might have come back from seeing Dune 2 :)Gets better after episode 4...The intrigue in flashback scenes are great- but that doesnt mean the rest is, which is the main bulk of the story.Plot follows the main actress as she learns the harsh way of the surface and below. Her brother as he questions life in the vault. We follow a man 'gone rogue' from a militant faction and his life choices. And finally an ex human now ghoul travel the wastelands by his lonesome.Coincidences galore... and gore galore.Starts like many sheltered societies after a devastating event (Silo, Raised by Wolves, Snowpiercer) and the mystery unfolds.... though, those shows are more interesting...(Trivia: the font of main title are from the Fallout Games)
1	A thrilling journey through the post-apocalyptic wasteland, capturing the essence of the beloved game franchise. With its gritty atmosphere, complex characters, and nods to the game lore, it's a treat for both fans and newcomers alike. The cast delivers stellar performances, especially in portraying the struggle for survival and moral ambiguity in a world ravaged by nuclear war. While some pacing issues arise, the captivating story and immersive world-building more than compensate. Overall, the Fallout TV show is a must-watch for anyone craving dystopian adventures and thought-provoking narratives.
2	I totally binged this story of what started out as case of kindness overloaded that quickly turned to frightening boiler bunny stuff. The actors nailed their parts and I could not turn it off, .... wondering where it was heading.. only to find that it surrounded two humans with their own self loathing stories. A few twists towards the end, I loved it and would recommend, however, not for the faint hearted. Dig in. Watch over the weekend when there is nothing else on..... a learning curve.. every bit as emotional as it is intriguing. Not what I was expecting, but gave in and throughly enjoyed it. Recommended.
1	Looking forward to Season 6, Feb 20th... As with any tv Seashow, there are good and not so good episodes. Hopeful, that stories /writing will step it up and take us fans to the next level. Past season has opened up insight into other persons'. I myself appreciate and greatly enjoy an ensemble cast, use of all characters, learning about what has shaped them into them. I understand lead actor Nathan Fillion was used as initial hook but the writers should look or use other characters available to open stories and cases up because to be honest some of the cases or stories with Nolan are laughable example season 4 episode 22. Review past season ratings and there is collation. Season 5 improved in ratings in great part because of story lines, and of course Chen and Bradford. There are two detectives, Lopez and Nyla where show can use to bring in more cases, Nyla and Chen undercover. The Rookie needs to expand because focusing on One character is not sustainable. Example: FBI (3), 911 all ensemble cast and have strong base of fans/follows.
0	So many good reviews on here are from people who have NOT read the novels! I read them all and honestly struggles to watch this show.Eiza Gonzales is SO unbelievable her acting is just awful as are many of the other performances. This just ruins the whole experience and makes it really unwatchable.The books are just incredible but this show does not come close to doing them justice - epic fail guys and Where the hell did all the money go??!HOW is this one of the most expensive shows ever made.? Mbe the directors salaries as there is very little expensive stuff to see.It's poor, rather boring and as already said the TERRIBLE acting just ruins it.I was SO excited to see this but it was horribly disappointing for me, it's doesn't come even close to doing the story justice.I cannot recommend watching this - READ THE BOOKS + Avoid this crappy show.
0	Bad story line and the dark was covering everything
1	When this show started it was one of my favorites. It was light and funny but could also get darker. What it really made better then other hospital shows was the very good cast. Also the music added to the atmosphere in a good way and the stories were very good.As the years progressed and some cast members went and new good cast members came it still upheld it's status as a very good show; I kept watching it with pleasure.Now it's not as good as other hospital shows and all new cast members are B-list actors selected for their looks but certainly not their skills.Definitively jumped the shark.
1	What happened to this show? I tune in every few months thinking the writers will resort back to the simple, mostly medical based storylines of their patients but it's become heavily focused on the medical team's incredibly disturbing, depressing lives. Too much infidelity and petty drama that is no longer focused on Meredith Grey, which is formerly why the show was well watched. The newer characters just do not and will not fulfill the attraction that the original characters once had. They were fired by Dr. Bailey and now what? Nobody wants to watch the surgeons losing their jobs. This is not what the audience wants to see, just a repeat of every other original cast member who is no longer on the show.
2	3 Body Problem is here and it did not disappoint. First of all I've never read any of the books so I have nothing to compare it to or be disappointed about. I can just take it for what it is and that's a really good sci-fi series. They've been talking about and hyping this show up for years now. The creators of Game of Thrones (David Benioff and D. B. Weiss) are the creators of this show to show that brings a lot of expectations with it. I'm glad they released it on Netflix so we get all the episodes at one time because I couldn't stop watching. There will be haters out there who live to hate everything but don't let that deter you because this is worth every second.
0	4/10 only because it looks mostly good. Poor casting, bad plot and worse thing is the script. It's like the writers and director overheard a conversation from some people who also overheard a conversation about the Fallout games. There are so many inaccuracies, not written or directed by true fans. Ghouls don't look like ghouls, they are too pretty. All the behaviors and dialogue of the characters are ridiculous. Everything that was obvious attempts at humor was not funny. Everything involving the Brotherhood of Steel is the most disappointing, I hope that some serious changes are made on the writers, director, staff and cast as soon as possible.
2	What a good start FX's (seen on Disney+) has made. Based on the 1975 novel by James Clavell, this story is based around the real life experiences of English sailor William Adams (John Blackthorne in book and series), a Royal Navy veteran, who became the first Englishman to reach Japan, and his rise to influence.With Spain and Portugal the great sea powers of the 1500s, Japan was little known, incredibly difficult to navigate to and closely guarded by the Catholic states, who were on a quest for riches. After the English defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, the Dutch and English, Protestant nations, allied against Spain and so Adams (Blackthorne) finds himself on a Dutch ship trying to open trade routes to Asia.From the outset this series takes us into 16th century Japan, in culture, language, politics, rivalry and intrigue. It's an excellent tale of differing cultures and beliefs conflicting but also merging, from Japan's rich heritage and tradition to the Catholic church's influence, not to mention the early antagonism between Protestant and Catholics.The story is rich, the production values, sets and locations excellent. We are only two episodes in, but one hopes the current standard in script and production continue.
0	"After watching this drama, there is no core, it is simple and crude, lacking scientific literacy and philosophical thinking.The play of respecting the Chinese scene in the original work removed the crucial debate on truth and thought in the original work, and only retained violence and hatred. Ye Wenjie's hatred towards the sun is even more embellished, distorting the original intention and attempting to express the playwright's own position. Ye Wenjie's true enemy is the evil in human nature. Her goal is to transform human civilization through the Three Body Civilization, rather than hating anyone, and she even admires the sun. ""We can only admire the advanced thinking of the highest decision-maker of the Red Bank project."" The scene of Operation Guzheng is also adding fuel and vinegar, changing the Judgment Day into a kindergarten, in an attempt to portray humans as villains by the playwright. The ETOs are frantically fleeing, seeming to express human cruelty. ""This is an immigration story, and humans are unwilling to accept aliens."" This is the playwright's attitude towards the invaders. And the special effects of this scene are fake, making people think it is an animated work produced by a certain company.The playwright piled up the chaotic scenes and forcibly cut them into a play, making the characters unable to stand up and without any memory points. I thought it was just a change of race and name for the original characters, but I didn't expect it to be a complete change. The roles were randomly assigned, the emotional scenes were mixed up, the comradeship became love, the ambiguity became passion, and I lost that kind of touching emotion, as if it were an undeveloped animal.Reviewed, xx is not working."
1	"I'm going to start this review by saying I know this isn't really an adaptation for those who are fans of the book and that's perfectly fine, And for those who haven't read the book or watched the Chinese version it's a serviceable show. As for those like me who've read the book and/or watched the Chinese adaptation it feels super rushed going from one story beat to another at the drop of a hat. A lot of the Character interactions and tension is just not there since the show moves way too fast for its own good.If you liked this show and want more 3 body I would recommend Chinese version, It's more faithful to the book but most importantly it gives the characters time to develop and the science aspect is more explored. The characters are just better but I know its harder to find unless you go through less ""legal"" means.Except captain Shi, They did captain Shi justice in both adaptation."
0	Never, never again !!! I will not watch this stupidity ever again ! All the people try to not think about Covid you push us to watch on a tv show, so sick minds ! Never ! F.... Y...
1	Meh. I was skeptical about the quality of this going in due to Netflix's abismal track record of adaptations, and the creators legacy on how they ended Game of Thrones (spoiler alert: terribly).As a reader of the books, the show just doesn't do them justice. It's kind of fun to see some of the more high-concept elements played out on the screen, but honestly, it was better in my head.I also don't like how they felt the need to make the main characters more relatable by making them equivalent to university third years. It felt kind of cheap, and the writing is very cringeworthy. The humour had no place in the books due to the subject matter, and to be honest it has no place here.Again, another example as to why 99% of adaptations just don't work.Netflix just never learns.Avoid, and do yourself a favour and read the books instead. They're fantastic.
0	I used to recommends a lot of my friends to watch GOT.. but after the final season/episode, it shattered everything. Poor writing, and it's just trash in the end. I just unsubscribed my HBO.Would you recommend ur friends to watch GOT again? F.ck NOWould you re-watch this series again, like you used to previously? F.ck NO
0	Its been infected by BLM. Drags down the fun factor considerably. Hopefully they can turn this around or else its dead Jim.27. feb 2021 - Its dead Jim. They went all woke.
1	"In comparison, Tencent version 7/10, Breaking Bad 9.5/10 It is neither the problem of cutting Wang Miao into five roles, nor having multiple actors of different gender/race playing Wang Miao/Luo Ji/Yun Tianming...It is simply a terrible adaption and misses many essential merits of the book...don't do S2, don't ruin it. Please redo S1 without Netflix and without 2DBOk, positive sides. Some characters have good performance: Liam Cunningham, Benedict Wong, Alex Sharp, and Jess Hong. Yun Tianming (Will)'s role has a better build-ups than the book. Maybe it is also building the base for future Cheng Xin (Auggie)'s choice, but let's see. Also, I really appreciate how they have a faithful show of Cultural Revolution, which is core to Ye's motives but unfortunately censored in Tencent's version. All other positive things should give credit to Cixin Liu...Terrible things...a lot...there are so so so many logical and physical loopholes...are you kidding with audience or do you think most of your audience never finish high school STEM courses? I don't want to name them one by one...almost every time this show wants to divert from the book, it makes a mistake...come on, three body problem is a masterpiece hard science fiction, do you really think you can make a better adaption in those key aspects than the author?Next, cultural revolution and Mao's era. Yes, it is great to have some CR scenes, but the characters inside do NOT behave like the people in that crazy age (except for that female red guardian). I will talk Ye later. Bai Muling, Yang Weining (Ye's true husband in the book) and the almost-gone political commissar Lei perform like there is no death-threatening political risks around and look very chill...and how can they survive the CR like that???Then, Ye Wenjie. Both young and old roles are way worse than the Tencent versions, and they made her like a hateful woman and a true villain. How can this Ye survive in CR with her hatred? And let her sleep with Bai and Evans? This is deeply wrong and an awful adaption, but I guess this is the limit of Netflix...This flat and shallow version loses the depth in Ye, who is disappointed on human but also hold hopes for the human being. This role is core of three-body problem, if you ruin her, you ruin the whole thing.Also, the first book is supposed to be a sci fi thriller, and Netflix makes it a high-school soap opera in a super mediocre way...yes, it paces faster than book and Tencent show, but it missed so so so many important explanations, plots, and metaphors to build up the tense of three-body problems. Why do many scientists kill themselves and say physics doesn't exist? Why there is no billiard explanation about what is happening? Where is the turkey scientist and 2d animal? Where are the internal conflicts within ETO???The directors suggest that the adaption of this book is difficult and they want to simplify it for the sake of audience. But I feel that they don't really get the essence of the book and have no respects for the audience and the book. They just want to make money from a drama show, so they set a book of entire human kind and the whole universe on a few folks from a class and two policeman in UK? This is a terrible product of Netflix's data-driven strategy as they just want to gain more audience with a fast-pacing, terribly routined and expensive show from hundreds of other shows and short videos on the market. I don't believe there will be many book fans being satisfied with this show, and the new readers of books will hate this version later. Quote from Cixin Liu in this book: ""Weakness and ignorance are not barriers to survival, but arrogance is""."
0	I don't understand why people like it so much. I really tried watching it but could not continue after a few chapters. Of course, the investment in production, costumes and effect are evident, but the plot, with its very trivial 'political' hints simply is not enough to make this series what it is claimed to be. Maybe it is mainly intended for people under 18.Disappointing.
0	We watched the trailer and read the movie synopsis, neither of which were interesting, but the reviews were compelling so we took the bait. Our advice; don't make the same mistake we did.The first couple of episodes aren't great but there were a few directions the movie could have gone so we stuck it out, again based on the 8.2 rating.The primary characters are simply bizarre and unlikable, with no redeeming qualities. The storyline could have been moderately interesting but it wasn't.The entire story appears to simply be a recounting of the writer's sexual/gender journey and the movie is simply a venue by which to share it.In summary, the movie is a big, steaming pile of reindeer scat, and avoid it all costs.
0	"Headnote: you can watch the show without reading the books but if you ask anyone who has read the books (myself included) they will tell you to read them first, anyways, ""our lord doesnt care either way""Set against the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution and extending into present where humanity faces existential threats from the cosmos, the trilogy weaves a complex tapestry of science, philosophy, and intrigue. At its heart lies the enigmatic Trisolaran civilization, whose existence poses a formidable challenge to humanity's understanding of the universe.The ideas and science are mindbending, the mystery keeps you at the edge till the end. The Three-Body Problem is part one of an award-winning trilogy by Liu Cixin - and is arguably the best Chinese science fiction novel ever translated into English. Liu uses the ""three-body problem"" of classical mechanics to ask some terrifying questions about human nature and what lies at the core of civilization."
2	Great concept and the lead character is playing his role just right. The cast and the stories have depth and sole. Producers put the viewers right there.
0	"The series falls short of expectations in several key areas. Firstly, the pacing of the screenplay is notably slow, leading to moments where viewers may find themselves disengaged or even nodding off. The background music, while present, could have been utilized more effectively to enhance the overall viewing experience. One of the major drawbacks lies in the characterization and performances of the cast. The characters often feel underdeveloped, and their actions lack depth, leaving much to be desired in terms of emotional engagement. This, coupled with what seems like a lack of direction from the director, contributes to an overall sense of disconnect with the storyline. In summary, the ""Three-Body Problem"" Netflix series struggles to captivate its audience due to its slow pacing, lackluster character development, and underwhelming direction. While it has potential, it ultimately falls short of being an engaging and memorable watch."
2	"To all naysayers and book purists: go read your books. This is TV sci-fi and it is clever and entertaining. Oh, you found plot holes and impossibilities? OK genius, I think some folks are giving you a treat at the end of the hallway. For the rest of us, leave us alone, enjoy sci fi series for once and move on.Yes, it has its slow moments, yes, it has some problems. What movie or series does not have it?? Please, save us from your gasp and shock. For those of us who do not bother with the books, oh blasphemy! HahaEnjoy it as I did. The idea is a great variation of the usual ""aliens are here to invade earth"". It gives perspective that it may be as difficult to them as it is for us to travel all the space distance. It also explores human reactions when the danger isn't that imminent. And of course, it sure explores how humanity could respond due to the fact that humans are inclined to superstitious / religious cultish thinking,Time to wait tor season 2!"
0	ZERO originality, if you told me this was written by a 12-year-old I would believe it.. or at the very least written for 12-year-olds..Comprised of 1000 close-up shots of Colin Farrells boring mug with 0 emotional expression and a desperate attempt at being a dollar shop Dexter Morgan with the countless garbage internal monologues this film will have you cringing from ear to ear and is certainly a great choice for insomniacs. It is if they took a part of every great film and tv show in the past 30 years and mashed it all into one giant stinking turd... Pretentiousness at it's finest. And people are rating this an 8, either you fell asleep and forgot.. or you smoked the dankest kush known to man kind.
0	I would have to say that Grey's anatomy is my # 1 favorite show! I watch re-runs everyday..because I'm waiting for the new season to watch! I love all the characters..Meredith and Derek are my favorites tho..! I just hope that the show..(the new season) will start and end as the MER/DER fans..would want it!I think there couldn't be any other characters for the show that would fit! ~I love the show and cant wait for the new season~! * a true fan* Julie from MT ~ I think that Christina and burke are perfect for each other..and that meredith and derek are clearly in love and that addison shouldn't ruin it! Please comment bacc on this..tell me what ur favorite characters are and why! OK thankx..!
2	Stupid making, pointless scenes, what Happened to the Director's brain sitting in a freezer
1	I can see why some think this is a masterpiece, it sure looks that way when compared to most of today's film and tv production.The scenography is excellent, the cast is mostly good, and Hiroyuki Sanada stands out here with his subtle and excellent performance.There is seriousness here, interesting intrigues and fun characters. The violence is shown brutally, as it should be, because that is the violence in real life and it should not be embellished.The atmosphere was interesting and somewhat realistic, it seemed as if after many years we would get a real historical spectacle without the insertion of characters who behave as if they were from the present time, but unfortunately I was mistaken.The writers had to insert a maid who kills Japanese warriors as if they were nothing, when I saw that hilarious scene I knew that this series would be just another one of those unrealistic series that has nothing to do with historical accuracy.Today's historical series are mostly like parodies, this show has a lot of good things, but this kind of thing simply lowers its impression.The direction is good, the soundtrack is solid and fits well with the atmosphere of the series.Of course the series is not historically accurate, the script is sometimes a bit clumsy. Some expressions are too modern, as well as the behaviour of some characters, but this is the standard in series today, it unfortunately lowers the whole impression.I've read that this is just another series where the writers express their hatred for Christians. I understand why some think so. At times it seems so.The series is significantly different from the book and most of the characters are different, especially Mariko. They wrote her as if she came from the 21st century, so unfortunately it seems unconvincing.Toranaga is arguably the best written, with subtle characteristics to make the viewer like him the most.Feudal Japan is a brutal but orderly system, in which mistakes are paid with life, and this is well represented here. The relationships in society are mostly well portrayed, with some exceptions, but hey, at least this series is not a complete parody like for example Vikings: Valhalla.Mostly good and interesting, but unfortunately with the usual flaws. Nevertheless, this series is worth watching, unlike most of today's productions.
2	A slower more nuanced take of movie version featuring Matt Damon with older characters approaching middle years yet aimlessly drifting through life.Actors are appropriately cast but 2 leads could easily switch roles and it would still work as both demonstrate subtlety of interpersonal dynamics, human fragility, and how we're all products of our environment.The androgynous looking actor playing Freddie lends an interesting twist as to why he's friends with Dickie when theyre clearly very different and seemingly have nothing in common aside from wealth.Shot in black/white the absence of color can be viewed as stylistic, but in this case it removes distraction of surrounding beauty forcing viewers to focus entirely on character interaction.
2	Wish more shows on television were as good as this one. Great cast and fun storylines. Hope it runs for a long time!
0	We really like the show but this season has been terrible with all the loud, back ground production music overpowering the show. You can't even hear the actors speak at times. Waste of a good show with this music ruining it.
2	"If you ask me what I advice you to watch, then it would be definitely ""Grey's Anatomy"". Now I'll talk about the reasons why this series deserves your attention and what are the disadvantages.The episodes tell the story about the doctors working in the Seattle Grace Hospital. I found the cast really ambiguous. At the one hand it shows us most of the aspects of the surgeon's life. On the other hand we see the personal life of the characters, their relationships and how they cope with their feelings. So, what I appreciate most is that the series shows us clearly the mistakes and problems that each of us can face in our lives. In my opinion the most obvious example would be a couple that I liked from the first episodes, these are Derek Shephard and Meredith Grey. These two have a rather complicated story.Speaking of shortcomings, I'd notice that often some relationships between the main characters become too long. For example, when we saw Meredith, overcoming her difficulties with her mum, that was far too stretched out.Anyway, this series can grab your attention if you're into medicine or maybe you adore dramas."
0	I had high hopes for this but it's all dark grim dirty and that lead, is he going for British accent, Portuguese? Dark and grim and the cast is ugly. The male Japanese lead is so tiny, he doesn't command the power as a leader. And yes I get it, they're in Japan. But this is meant for Japanese audience or for North Americans. Reading the subtitles gets cumbersome. Feel like a foreign series, The female lead is also ungrateful, speaks commonly and has zero star power. I get it trying to make it all authentic and realistic but as an audience I want to be entertained and all I see is dark grim unattractive people and nobody smiles. It gets tiresome just sitting through one episode. Sorry it's a pass for me.
2	I've read a lot of comments saying this is one of the best video game adaptations of all time. I don't know about that as I've never played the game but what I do know is that it's one of the best post apocalyptic series ever made!It's basically split into 3 stories which interconnect.There is Lucy, played by Ella Purnell, who lives in a community under the earth in one of 3 Vaults. No one has ventured outside since the world became a radioactive wasteland. But circumstances will dictate that Lucy will go outside in a quest to find her father.Then there is Maximus played by Aaron Moten, a servant assigned to look after a Knight called Titus. Knights are men who wear powerful suits of armour and are highly regarded and respected. Maximus has a dream of becoming one and that dream is eventually realised.Then last but by no means least there's The Ghoul, a mutant cowboy with a droll delivery and no nose. This character is destined to become iconic and Walton Goggins who plays him is faultless. He's funny, scary and ruthless in equal measure but has a great backstory which humanises him.The creation of the devastated world and creatures that inhabit it are beautifully rendered. It is visually stunning but the visuals are backed up by an excellent script and brilliant direction. The pace is just about perfect. The intertwining of the stories is expertly done.This is hugely entertaining and leaves you wanting more.
2	Love the show but dislike the multiple scenes being shown through the view of body cameras I'm very motion sensitive and find it hard to watch..The actors and characters are very strong and believable. Enjoy the plots as well as the humor that is added to the plots.
2	Do you ever find yourself watching a TV show that has you sitting on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next? Many people have their favorite types of shows, but one of my favorite in particular is a medical soap opera series called Grey's Anatomy. With the action filled drama, to death, love, loss, and humor, it is sure to keep you entertained. The show has a few main characters, the main one being Meredith Grey who wants to pursue her mother's ambitions in surgery. More interns in the show are Christina Yang, George O'Malley, Alex Karev, and Izzie Stevens, just to name a few of the large cast. This entertaining cast is sure not to bore, whether you are looking for excitement or interested in the medical field, this show is for you! If you are really looking for a thrill that does a phenomenal job at showing the everyday struggles of doctors and nurses, you've come to the right place. Doctors and nurses are often people that we look up to, but during their 12+ hour shifts, there is a lot they experience. In the show, it does a fantastic job at showing things from intense surgeries, to patients battling cancer, and then of course, death. One thing that they do really well is to show the close relationships that these workers have to their patients, and what their recovery is like with them. One very negative thing that I and many other reviewers on websites like IMDb.com say, is that throughout the show, which is 13 seasons long, the main characters that we have become attached to die off or leave, which makes it seem like the whole cast and show is remade. Arguably the most important aspect of this show are the compelling stories that leave viewers on edge and coming back for more. Just some examples of the intense situations are when people come in to the emergency room with a big metal object through their head, a person shot who is bleeding out, a shooting in the hospital while patients are trying to be saved, or a child surviving or dying of cancer. Throughout these situations, viewers see the emotions, loss, and many other things while the doctors and surgeons are under a tremendous amount of pressure overworking themselves to save those they care about most. According to an article on The Atlantic, TV makes viewers judge the aspects of reality. In Grey's Anatomy, patients with the worst cases often survive them way more often than they would in real life, which can be negative if you are looking for serious medical situations, or good if you are looking to cry and be on edge. Another reason to tune into this show is the exhilarating story line. On websites reviewing the show such as IMDb.com, many users talk about this, saying things like the show isn't always serious, because along with being about medicine, it is also about relationships within the hospital. But when the seriousness is happening, the details of the show make us forget about that aspect. Of course, just like all shows or movies, they are compared to others within the same genre. There are many, many shows out there that are like Grey's Anatomy, such as Chicago Med, ER, General Hospital, Scrubs, and many more. Although these shows all take place in a hospital, there are many things that make them different from each other. It seems as though the other shows are a lot more serious, which some people do like, but Grey's Anatomy has a lot to offer. Whether it be the humor, life lessons, cliff hangers, relationship drama, or your emotions building up, it is for sure a spin on the typical medical show. The variety can be good for those seeking something different, but bad for those looking for medical seriousness. Overall, Grey's Anatomy is a show that will please even the most skeptical viewers. Of course it has positives and negatives, but the show really does a great job at portraying hospital life and giving life lessons. It is highly recommended for anyone to try out and get a feel for the lasting thrill it gives that will have you coming back for more, unable to stop.
2	"As an avid reader, I am often disappointed by what is represented by the silver screen. I initially get excited to see one of my favorite series on the big screen, and eventually walk away disgusted. For whatever reason, most shows and movies that are based on epic book series absolutely butcher the original content. So when I saw the preview for ""Game of Thrones"" on HBO, I was immediately skeptical. Oh, I was going to watch it, but I didn't have high expectations. I did hold a little hope because HBO is known for their high quality shows. I was absolutely shocked to watch the Pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. The language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. It stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it. The acting is superb and I actually felt like I was looking into Winterfell for the first time. I feel like I've actually got faces to add to the characters that I've been reading about for a long time. If you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from HBO to add some spice to the series. This is not the case at all. The books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the Pilot. I am very proud of HBO for producing an amazingly accurate product. I will be watching every week for sure. If you enjoyed what you saw in the Pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. ""Game of Thrones"" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. I would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.UPDATE:I have now watched 3 Episodes and I wanted to come back and report some more. Even after 3 Episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. Overall the acting is still very good. I hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script. I don't get this impression with this HBO adaptation. Each episode of this series leaves me itching for the next weekend. I really hate watching shows in real time because I enjoy absorbing several hours of a show at one time. But, a good show will keep you looking forward to it the whole week. A special note to viewers that have not read the books... Keep watching! This series has numerous twists and turns and full of epic battles and action. It may seem like it's taking a little while to develop, but the reward is well worth the wait. Even after 3 episodes, I would still highly recommend this to anyone."
2	As written and as portrayed by Colin Farrell, Sugar is a very original and fascinating character. He hates hurting people but he's very capable of it. He doesn't like guns but he'll carry one because of the insistence of his manager and because it's the exact gun used in a film classic he admires. Thats because he loves movies. Sugar is reminiscent of Chili Palmer, more introspective, but same decency despite the shady nature of their vocations, low key disarming charm that doesn't draw a lot of attention, same ability to intimidate without raising their voice, and the same love of film. Both are experts at finding people for their clients. Sugar is haunted by his past and there's a melancholy to his being even when he smiles. So far the series is engrossing and almost hypnotic in its smooth execution, but what makes it compelling is the central performance (aided by a very capable supporting cast) by Farrell as private investigator John Sugar.The case itself isn't remarkably unique, but the antagonists keep the stakes high and the danger present a real. It's the same type of down the rabbit hole looking detective case they've been making since the 1930s, but at least it's down with some style, humor, a bit of action, great work from a fantastic cast and cleverly inserted noir film clips. A definite recommendation for fans of the genre and fans of Farrell.
1	I watched the first 3 episodes but don't intend to watch any more. The show is very well done but the main character, John Sugar (played by Farrell, one of my favorite actors) is completely unbelievable.After watching the first episode I actually looked into the series to see if it was considered to be classified as science fiction or supernatural in terms of the genre. I thought for a minute that the character of Sugar might be some sort of divine angel sent to Earth to save people. Nope. Apparently he's a real human. A completely unbelievable real human.It's a shame because I had high hopes for the series, what with being a fan of Farrel, but I'm just not able to suspend belief to the level needed to continue watching.
1	"I haven't read the book (translated version), but I'm sure scientists the world over are mature people who have reached the pinnacle of profession after years of struggle and hard work. The scientists in this series are young 20 somethings? Wow! Are they all child prodigies? Or did Benioff and Weiss make this series only for young target audience? Anyway, the acting sucks. Benedict Wong looks amused all the time. Maybe he was wondering ""what am I doing here""?And there is no need to need to kill characters off a la Game of Thrones! Do these guys know how to write anything apart from popcorn chaos thrillers?Had more expectations. Ah well! Better luck next season guys."
2	I'm not a read the show kind of person. I want to enjoy the settings and the action on screen. Not try to read everything and glance up once in a while to see the scenery. I'm 20 minutes in and I can barely tell you what settings they been to. I'm to busy trying to read subtitles. I get the authentic vibe you're looking for and wanting the best Japanese actors. Now have them dub their own lines if they can speak even broken English. And dub actors for the rest of the cast. There has to be enough Japanese people to keep the acting in country. If that's what you're after. I believe that I'm in the majority on this stance.I've waited very eagerly for this to be released and I can't fully enjoy the show because I'm forced to read it.
0	I can't beleive how much the writing and dialogue has declined over the last few seasons. The banter is comically bad-similar to network tv. Disappointing since the show from every aspect, characters, story line and dialogue, was probably the best show ever. Terrible.
0	TerribleSome notably egregious casting choices in this. First of all Freddie Miles - what the hell were they thinking? Ripley too, blimey! I like Andrew Scott a lot, but he's not right for this role. Dickie and Marge, just meh - not particularly bad, but not good either.Black and white, in a sort of saturation down, contrast up manner - doesn't work. It's also Italy - come on!!!! I'd have been fine if it was an old film, or it served a clear purpose, but I really can't connect with this particular decision.Far too much creative freedom afforded to the director here, in a manner that in my mind disrespects the books, in addition to previous adaptations and character portrayals. The director appears to have all the adaptation, writing and director credits. Had way too much creative control.I was excited about seeing this, however it became a painfully dull viewing experience. Tons of unnecessary padding.In any case the casting choices appear to have been deliberately blind, in such a way I can't get on board with them I'm afraid, in addition to which they just didn't seem to understand the source material they were working with.Most importantly of all - the series is utterly lifeless. I keep picking it up and dropping it. A key, initial death, involving a certain character has almost no emotional build up. You can appreciate how certain characters made themselves vulnerable to Ripley in the book, and other adaptations, but here no part of those relationships work at all, in the interests of giving any sense of emotional weight.I re watched The Talented Mr Ripley soon after this, and thank goodness I did, as I didn't want to have my memories of this story overshadowed by this horrible production. I've never appreciated Phillip Seymour Hoffman so much!
0	Italy: One of the most beautiful countries in the world and sadly this series is filmed in black and white. One might even refer to this as blasphemy. How can one enjoy this series when such incredible scenery is available to behold? It may as well have been filmed in a cave.I don't understand why the main character cannot use his own charming accent while playing this role. His character is boring enough without adding insult to injury.Watched E1 and hoped it would improve but sorry to say, a huge disappointment of film entertainment.But, I will not give up on future film entertainment because once in a while a good one comes along.
1	The ending of this series is a disservice to the public!The first seasons are great as they are based on the books source material and, apparently, the writers are good enough at adapting other people ideas. After season four there's a decline, not so manifest at first since the goodness of the source material still lingers around. It's more of a slow deterioration, a spiral into shallow writing that peaks in a last season devoid of content and value. Where at first grand scale developments, societal issues and world-spanning intrigues dominated the narration with characters being the pawns of the true overarching story, later in the seasons characters and stereotypical interactions take the stage and the interesting, long developing issues that made the story captivating get resolved in the most unrewarding ways possible. It's incoherent, detached, uninspired writing. It's everything that is bad in mainstream media.All of this because the writers decided they had enough with the show and grew bored with it. So they wanted to wrap it up as soon as possible in order to go on and ruin the Star Wars franchise (more than it already is). Thanks for your disservice!It needs to be mentioned that the overall production, sound design, acting, cinematography, all of these are quite extraordinary and elevate the show quite a bit, even when the writing declines. The quality is amazing. It probably is still worth watching for its entertainment value. It just doesn't pay off. The ending season ruins quite literally everything.
0	The original book might be too big for average Americans, who are (quote from Sheldon on The Big Bang Theory) indicment of American education system. The original book tells a story about how all human beings behave when they know about the truth of universe and a all-mighty specis is coming. This adaptation has dumbed it down to popcorn- a small elite circle united to resist. Perhaps it's because Americans can no longer understand something big. To be honest.Therefore, the philosophical connotation of Three-Body Problem is dumbed down to popcorn that American audience can understand: all the characters know each other and are in the same circle. People all over the world only need to obey, and the elites in the small circle unite to save the planet.This is the classic American heroism and the elite view of history that abandon the social fabric. However, compared to the portrayal of these savior elites in the film, the practice of depicting ordinary people as background ants only further exacerbates the narrative flaws of the series. The small circle of elites with the most powerful voice brings suffocating American-style decision-making black box... In this case, it is also assumed that human beings unite to complete part of the wall-facing task. For the opposite reality, this plot is completely meaningless.The final display of the eighth episode shows that the power of all mankind is not as magnificent as Space X live. The cosmic vision fell back to the small North American studio that could not see the scale, destroying the cosmopolitan mind that the entire film had constructed.
2	This series is great! Watching it made me want to play the Fallout games all over again, specially Fallout New Vegas, a favorite of mine. The scenery is beautiful, the main characters are interesting, most of the time, specially Lucy, the vault dweller. The script is engaging and it shows all the things that whoever likes the game, will also enjoy on the series. But the main reason I wanted to watch this series is because of Jonathan Nolan. Loved his other projects, such as Person of Interest and Westworld, and he is a good sci-fi series creator.Summarizing, this series is worth the watch and worthy of your time to check it out.
1	Overall I am happy with the adaption. All the key scenes are there, and well presented. The actors are doing a great job. The story is more or less well paced.There are weak moments and sometimes the story drags a bit, which is a pity, given that some of the important moments of the books that would be crucial for understanding are shortened or skipped. But for most of the time the plot is well reproduced and the story telling is spot on.However, merging the characters of the book into a group of five friends was unnecessary. It renders the story implausible (why should every important event happen to these five friends from college?) and the story telling shallow (some scenes and dialogs are down there on soap opera level).I give the show a solid 6/10.
2	First of all I would like to mention that I was skeptical when I first started watching this show simply because Hiroyuki Sanada has been casted as the japanese dude in any and all hollywood movies and shows. Is it really that difficult to find japanese talent? But after watching the first episode I was baffled by the quality of production of this show. Everything from Acting to set to costumes, everything was top notch and I was immersed in feudal japan. This show kind of reminded me of Shogun World from HBO TV series Westworld also featuring Hiroyuki Sanada as Main Japanese Guy, although he was a samurai in that one i believe.
1	"I'll make it clear that I haven't read the books, but I almost bought them to read before the series. Sci fi is my favorite genre of fiction, and the 3 Body Problem permeated my feed for a couple of years.Hence my disappointment: if you, like me, were hoping to watch the next television event after Game of Thrones, I'm sorry to say that this is not it.It's a shame that such a good story has been adapted into such a silly series.PLOT: From what I've been able to research after finishing the last episode, a lot has been ""adapted"" (completely changed) from the original source, and usually for the worse. Despite this, the plot itself is very interesting, although confusing and a little too crazy.In fact, these changes are what make the series such a bizarre narrative. The flashbacks in China are memorable, full of emotion and high drama, while everything that takes place in London is like a mixture of the most boring seasons of Westworld and some teen drama.CAST: The cast is a mess. Some good actors are badly cast, like Jonathan Pryce and Alex Sharp, while others shine, like Jess Hong as Jin Cheng and Zine Tseng as Ye Wenjie.The characters themselves are pretty bland, a group of geniuses who act like scumbag university students. Saul gets one of the coolest plot points in the series, but he's a loser, cynical pothead... Auggie (although well portrayed by Eiza Gonzalez) is completely one note, and John Bradley plays the most unpleasant guy in the world.At least Bradley didn't reprise his role as Sam Tarly from GoT, while Liam Cunningham continues to play Davos Seaworth, only in this universe he is more like Stannis Baratheon.DIRECTION/PRODUCTION/MUSIC I don't know what happened in these areas, but it's all pretty mediocre. The VR scenes are tedious and with PS1 CGI..., as well as a dull humor that kills any tension in the story; the soundtrack is like something recycled from Westworld (which isn't bad, but it's not great either); and the production itself is dreadful, with Galileo wearing modern glasses and a stylish tuft...Seriously, it looks like the series was developed by 2 completely different teams, because the flashback scenes are excellent; everyone is dirty, looks tired, etc. While the present-day scenes show soldiers working in the hot Panamanian sun, but their clothes are perfectly ironed and smooth.In short, the series is watchable, but that's about it. If you're saying (or hearing) it's the new Game of Thrones, or that it's the best sci-fi show of recent times, do yourself a favor and go watch The Expanse."
2	I was looking for something to watch casually. The premise seemed interesting and the ratings were unusually high for a limited series that I hadn't heard about yet. I had no idea what I was in for. I thought I was going into a bizarre stalker story, which in a sense it was, but it's full meaning goes much deeper and darker than I was expecting. A few things I saw coming, others took me by surprise. This is a story about the unhealthy ways one tends to deal with pain and trauma. I didn't expect such a gut-punch of a story. Made all the more intense because it actually happened. You don't necessarily have to experience what the people in this story experienced, to identify with them. This is a rare story that is quite powerful, very well told, and grabbed me by the throat at several times by the end. I don't rate things 9/10 very often, but this absolutely deserves it. It's not always an easy watch, but I fully recommend you see it.
1	"Two episodes in and I'm questioning is this TV show is going to get any better. I've watched Nathan Fillion and Melissa O'Neil in other TV shows and they're fun to watch, and at the moment it's the only reason why I'll invest any time watching The Rookie at all. The ""professional"" police officers who are training the rookies seem a bit detached. Maybe that's what they're going for? Also, if they're seasoned police officers, they don't seem very aware of what's going around them and their environment. This can either be put down as bad writing or directing because the actors have potential. The show is a bit bland regardless of all the action scenes. The Rookie is a bit disjointed and no flow to individual episodes as a whole. Is it a comedy, is it drama, it is both? I'm not getting much of either. I struggle to find any meaning or depth to this show. Having said all that, I don't mind watching The Rookie while I'm doing paperwork because I don't have to pay much attention because I'm really missing much."
2	This was the first show in a long long time I binged in just two nights.It's a rare show that comes along and feels pure in its writing. Truthful, painful and easy to see yourself in Gadd/Donny.I winced through an awful lot of it but couldn't look away. I kept watching and waiting for a reckoning a comeuppance or some sort of revenge piece but no one really got their just desserts which I suppose made it all the more realistic.Amazing piece of storytelling from someone who's been through so much. I guess that's where the win was that Donny/Gadd were looking for all that time.Be prepared with a box of tissues.
2	"I remember seeing the trailer for this series a few months back and thought this is what I've been looking for; Japan in the late seventeenth century. The production is excellent and could easily be mistaken for a high budget film. The writing is sharp and even had quirk in it, fast paced and thought provoking. But what stood even beyond this is the characters. They actually feel real, imagine that in this time of famine, we have been starved of intelligent characters for so long, it felt refreshing to actually see writers put some effort into building these ""people"". Speaking of which, John Blackthorne the wild card British Pirate(Merchent - yeah right) that could upset the tides of war was a bold gamble on the writers behalf, but if they play there cards right, he might be the Ace that grants this series it's well deserved second season. If you haven't already, I would strongly recommend you start this series, you will not regret it."
1	Sorry loved the show and the build up but wasn't it all a build up to show the famous battle was I the only one expecting to experience the great battle ,which if you read up on the actual battle would of been a great ending to the story a chess match no one expected with sides changing in the middle of the actual battle but just tell you a little bit of what would actually happen at the battle .Felt a little short changed at the end ,was like watching Napoleon and at the end they skip the battle ...On a plus side thought the acting was excellent but shame we didn't get to see the master plan actually unfold.
1	Kurosawa directed a masterpiece in 1957, Seven Samurai. This is something I've went back to many times, sadly I don't think Shogun warrants repeated plays.By no means is this a poor show, it certainly doesn't warrant some of the criticism, this is a good show; a good show not a great one.The casting is exceptional and the acting really very good, the story itself is also very good, the pace, atmosphere, cinematography all really very good.I think the thing for me that knocks this from a solid 9 to a 7, is the character played by Cosmo Jarvis.It's like he's sat down and watched the excellent TV series, Taboo, and tried to emulate some of the characteristics that Tom Hardy displayed playing the character James Delaney.I'm sure had I not seen Taboo, this may have went completely over my head, however I have and this just seems like a less convincing version of a character.That said, it is a good show and I'm sure I'll be there if and when they do a second series.
0	"So, this started like most HBO crap: lots of blood, ""in your face"" nudity to remind you why you pay the extra instead of settling for the basic cable package, and sex more sleazy than the average Hustler vid.Except that the women of Thrones aren't ""amazing"". They look like what the porn industry throws on the ""amateur"" flicks. And thats WITH the make-up. The sex was boring; there's more chemistry in a math class than on these sets. And the fighting and blood were clearly done by someone that hasn't seen combat or held any of those weapons or armor. Oh, and the gay pandering is so blatant, Im surprised it isn't being boycotted. Im serious, until season 5 they cant do an episode without grinding your face in gay sex. It seems like the few rare scenes that Don't involve homosexual sex in some way are the incest scenes. I've heard of ""blaxploitation"" as a category, but what do we call this? ""gaysploitation""? ""homosploitation""? Should it be more insultive, as the ""blax"" is, to show contempt for the disrespect it does to the minority pandered to?I guess the ""kill a named character every two episodes"" mantra actually comes from the books, which is all the more reason not to read the books, to me. If I want some pompous jackwagon that spends 2 pages introducing me to the character just to immediately kill off said character, I'll go back to Victorian authors like dickens, who were paid by the letter, rather than for content. We're in season 5, and the only character left from the beginning that you might care about is Ari. The screen-writers have gotten so desperate Cersi is naked. I realize there's an audience for middle-aged women with buzz-cuts getting pelted with garbage and sewage, I just figured it was mostly centralized in German fetishism, not HBO ""mainstream"" audience. Or maybe the two are really one and the same?The only central plots across the seasons are ""winter is coming"", because apparently in this world that doesn't happen every year? IDK, they never address why its so important that seasons, ya know, change and stuff... Oh, and the other is, ""if you do good, your gonna get screwed"". Every character that tries to ""do the right thing"", or act good, whether in character or not, pays for it. And in GoT, there's only one way you pay: death. Often with a little creepy-border-line rapey-time as well, especially in the later seasons.Do yourself a favor. If you want to watch porn, watch porn. If you want to watch TV, watch TV. Avoid this hybrid abortion."
0	It started off well, the story grabbed my interest, helped along by the beautiful cinematography. After that though it started to lose me and by episode three I was wondering if I was really watching a goofy and very weak black comedy with a protagonist who is incredibly incompetent and barely capable of tying his own shoelaces.I've not read the original book, I've not even seen the movie starring Matt Damon, but I'm now tempted to at least watch the movie because it has good word of mouth.But back to this series ....... not only does it play out like a weak black comedy but the script and the acting has a stilted quality that reminds me of bad theatrical plays.The acting is nothing special - not bad, but not great either.In short, I'm extremely disappointed.
1	She is not a good actress. Her emotionless face makes it impossible to connect. Looking at a fixed point without reacting is not acting. She spends the whole series with a look of surprise and fear, but it's just an attempt because she doesn't succeed. I'm sorry, but with such a big budget they could have hired someone who could act. The rest of the casting is fine. Especially the Chinese. In general there is a greater repertoire of emotions. I mean, they know how to act.On the other hand, the story is good. The creators make the impossible, possible. But they made a mistake with the protagonist.
2	Season 1: Fallout has a particular flavor when it comes to post apocalyptic tales. Luckily, the show captured it perfectly. The aesthetic was perfect. I felt like I was in the fallout world. You could tell from the junk in the background and the uniforms and the way the armor looked. Whoever did the set design did their homeworkThe tale of these three characters are great. The characters are very still developed and have great character arcs.This does a lot of fan service to the people who played the games. If you like sci-fi, post apocalyptic things and/or wacky dark humor you might like this, but if you're more of a casual show watcher, this might not be for you.But there wasn't a lot to complain about. The ending was okay, but kinda meh. The journey was great but the way it was tied up was not great imo.I didn't like the liberties they took with some aspects of the lore but I understand this is an adaptation, not a copy of the video games on a different medium.All in all, I enjoyed the ride. I can't wait for season two.
1	"There are A LOT of things to like in the series. But these last 2 episodes (season 8) were a downer for me. In episode 2, I understand the quiet before the storm, but the pace was so slow, and the acting was so flat I had a foreboding omen. Episode 3 had better be a killer!It wasn't.Who exactly advised you on strategy? You guys had a CASTLE to defend (from the inside. Behind tall structures called walls). Maybe you thought that PARKING your entire army OUTSIDE the walls in PARADE stance against absolute darkness was strategy? Maybe you thought that throwing basically your entire cavalry in one suicide attack IN THE DARK was a good idea?That is the most RIDICULOUS way of throwing your forces into the fire!Have you ever heard of ""The last charge of the Light Brigade""?Such a disappointment."
0	I liked it until Season 6. Then I kept watching it -just because- until Season 11. I recently checked back and I couldn't watch a single episode without flinching. To me, it went from a 7-star series, to a 3-star, then to a negative-1-star (negative, because the producers are still extracting profits out of a very low-quality show). The weighted average is now 1 star!Every marriage fails. Every pregnancy becomes a high-risk one. Every season finale involves some big crash/disaster. Majority of the characters have been on the operating table, survived a major surgery, and never experienced a single complication during (a super speedy) recovery. And we are supposed to believe that highly intelligent characters, world-class doctors, base their arguments on emotions and irrational explanations. The drama heavily relies on situations that are highly implausible. Are the writers not able to actually produce quality writing?
2	I really don't watch police shows. I can count on one hand of all of the police series I have watched and actually liked. I started watching this out of boredom and liked it right away. I really didn't know much about Nathan Fillion other than he played in Firefly. He makes the whole show. I love this actor. The rest of the cast are good also...I love the different stories and are well written....This really a well acted and written series that deserves the high rating...
0	"Spoilers ahead!!Watched all 8 episodes. Disappointed!I haven't read the books, but I couldn't believe it had such enormous hype. I hope this isn't a true adaptation.For a story revolving around physicists, this makes a mockery of the entire scientific community. Fate of humanity rests on the hands of a bunch of post-docs from a single dept of one university all working under the same professor? Yeah why not! Let's not forget one of them is a potato chips salesman.Where are the astrobiologists? Nuclear physicists? Experimentalists? Astroliguists? Engineers? Don't ask!Atleast they could have developed these characters better to make us believe in them. For instance, they could have been PhDs or postdocs whose careers have taken them into different paths. They're all in their 40s or 50s, now they are the who's who in their respective fields, with many scientists and engineers working under them. And they meet after many years at the funeral of their professor. Atleast that would have been believable.There's no background information about their scientific contributions. We are just told ""they're from Oxford, they're young, and working in (insert some science-y sounding words) and so they're the best"". That's it!There is no teamwork. Everyone is a specialist in something. Occasionally one of them goes to the other and says ""can you do this for me?"", and the other person does it all alone in a computer, like a bunch of fairies waving magic wands. I'm sorry creators of the show, that's not how science and engineering works.Atleast I could have forgiven the creators if only they introduced these characters any better than how they did. The way they introduce the two ladies in that bar scene, just instantly lowered my expectations for the show. I went in expecting a GoT level show.. Gosh was I so disappointed.. If you're a budding screenwriter reading this review, please remember this: scientists would never talk about themselves in such a bombastic way, especially if they're so early in their careers, and that too to a stranger who's clearly not a scientist himself. Watch Oppenheimer, Arrival, Interstellar, Contact to know how real scientists talk. If that's how you introduce your main characters, it's just an instant turn off. How can we root for a person like that?There are so many loopholes in the story. Like, why just China figured out how to talk to aliens? Nasa here sending people to the moon and robots to mars and probes to Pluto but couldn't figure out how to send a signal to the sun? And why only this Wong guy and his boss investigate the murders of these scientists? Clearly they're dying everywhere, not just in the UK. A senior scientist in India died by suicide? Yeah let's wait for the never-heard-before detective working for a shady UK govt organization to arrive at the crime scene.If the aliens are so powerful that they listen to every single conversation happening at every location in the world, and they could cover the entire planet with a weapon the size of a proton, how come they're so dumb as to not find another habitable planet somewhere nearby to their star? With such technology, you don't even need a habitable planet. You can just simply terraform any planet.And what's with that stupid VR game thing? It's such an elaborate subplot just to reveal the evil plan of the bad guys. I thought bond villains are the worst!Why slice through an entire ship like a vegetable chopper slicing an onion, just to recover a hard drive? Imagine you're the head of MI6, and you ask your subordinates to come up with a plan for a covert operation to retrieve a hard drive from a cruise ship, and this is the plan your subordinates come up with. This is like letting Peter Griffin device a plan for capturing Bin laden. Just makes no sense at all!And why choose a high school teacher's brain as your choice for communicating with the aliens? What about the thousands of octogenarians and septuagenarians who spent their entire lives trying to talk to aliens? Surely at least one of them must be in their death beds, and would definitely jump at such an opportunity. As I mentioned earlier, it's like Stranger things met interstellar.But I just sincerely hope that some of these plot holes are eventually addressed in future seasons. I haven't read the books, so I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt at the moment. If not, even a 3/10 would become too generous of me.This once again reinforces the belief that Benioff and Weiss are nothing without the genius of GRRM. The moment they start putting their own brains into their creations, their true creativity is visible for everyone to see."
0	"*** This review may contain spoilers ****Plot and ending analyzed*It seems that the producers hired the most annoying, uncouth, asinine, and boorish Englishman that they could find. Where did they find this guy? At the taverns? At the docks? All he does is curse and curse. In reality, no Japanese feudal lord would put up with his outbursts. This bloke is so bloody over the top ridiculous and insane that it really ruined the fine acting from the Japanese actors. His acting is so wooden, and he doesn't inspire any sympathy at all. He is a loudmouth braggart. If you are a stranger in a strange land, it probably would prolong your life to keep quiet and assess the situation. But this guy, he is a bombastic vulgarian. Why the Portuguese rogues or few Spaniards did not toss him into the tides is beyond me.Another major problem was that one of the writers was a woman, and it looks like they let her inject some modern day extreme feminism in many of the action scenes. There's a household maid that starts killing everyone with a knife and they made it look like she was unstoppable. The attack in the forest scene had the Japanese woman translator pick up a spear and hack about five Japanese soldiers with ease. It was absolutely stupid. That completely ruined the decent dramatic scenes. I am sure that she will be fighting samurai in the later episodes. And what did the Englishman do during the attack, did he pick up a sword himself? Nope.And the English steersman is supposedly speaking Portuguese while we are hearing English? Okay. While he does not know a word of that language? The script continuity supervisor completely failed the audience.Not to mention that the writers are vehemently anti-Catholic and despise the Portuguese and Spaniards while favoring the Dutch and English.And the idiotic scene with the boats and ships? Utterly unrealistic. Preposterous. This is the type of dumb things that we are forced to sit through, cartoon fantasy scenes.The English steersman was supposedly starving and had scurvy on the long trip to Japan, but when he took off his clothing to swim, it appeared that he had been at the gymnasium recently.And as usual, they made the Japanese translator very beautiful. She can not be fat or ugly. How is that for the double standard? On the one hand, women can fight exactly like men, but then they have to look beautiful. Hypocrisy.Episode four was just dreadful. Apparently, the English steersman, who said he knew nothing of military tactics and expertise in the previous episode, is an artillery genius in this episode. And he trains a few Japanese soldiers, making them experts as well. Seventeenth century artillery guns were unwieldy and difficult to shoot accurately. In a highly preposterous scene, the new Japanese artillery men make waste of some enemy horsemen from 1000 yards out. And the general, whose limbs are all bloody and absent, mutters that it was not honorable behavior. All that because some impetuous young son wanted attention.The English steersman, who in previous episodes is made out to be a devout Protestant, sleeps with a Japanese prostitute, and he is married. More hypocrisy. And there is more foreshadowing that the Japanese translator may be a key to the future. I personally think that she may be a trained assassin who has a shady past, and will kill the enemy lord. If that is the case, this whole series is a complete farce. The episodes are getting progressively worse and worse.Episode five is more of the same haggard storytelling, which in this case, amounts to more of the same nonsense from all the previous episodes. There is some uninteresting balderdash about a dead chicken pheasant that is ""not supposed to be touched"". The Englishman was jokingly saying that anyone who touched it would be killed. Turns out, the gardener touched it and was put to death, and the Englishman is wondering why. His empty-headed buffoonery is getting tedious.Then the husband of the Japanese translator has ""miraculously"" returned alive. Apparently, he and ten unemployed samurai fought off those hundred soldiers. Okay. Whatever. Well, the writers put him through the sewer in this episode. They made him more unlikeable than Genghis Khan. He can not hold his Japanese liquor against the Englishman, but he still is an expert marksman with a bow and arrow.They also put out the expected female victim card for the Japanese translator, so that the audience can weep and instantly side with her. Except it was done in a horrible manner, so to an educated viewer, it looks entirely contrived.More contrivance is included later when the lazy writers throw in an unexpected earthquake. The laughable scene is so utterly inane that you have to see it to believe it. I'm sure they will also include a tsunami in the following episodes.I don't think that the series will improve much. But I'll still watch it to the end. Like a man on a sinking ship.Hopefully a few good things will come from this pathetic and pitiable series. Japanese mom and pops restaurants will have some business, people will buy some Japanese history and art books, and that they will also look to the past for the excellent Japanese film directors, who include Akira Kurosawa.Stick with the original version and the book itself. This version is useless and horrendous. A complete waste of time."

2	I love this show and think about it until the next time I can watch it! on Netflix One thing seems especially unrealistic though: Since when do SURGEONS do SURGERY with all their JEWELRY on?
0	The characters are almost entirely awful, unlikeable people who act like teens at the best of times, but usually they all act about 5 except they won't stop having sex in the hospital.So many of them cheat on each other but only one character is an a bad person for it, while everyone else just gets a mostly free pass.I just watched an episode where Dr. Burke and Dr. Yang lied about Dr. Burke's trembling hand so he could still perform surgeries, thus endangering so many lives. And yet the chief character refuses to punish them in any way.And the list goes on and on. There's not a single good thing about this show and I have no idea how it has such good ratings. Is quality and good characters really not that important to other people?
2	"As Episode 1 of ""Ripley"" (2024 release; 8 episodes ranging from 44 to 76 min) opens, it is ""Rome, 1961"" and we see Ripley dragging a dead body down the stairs. We then go to ""Six Months Earlier"", with Ripley living in New York and barely getting by. Then one day he gets contacted by a shipbuilder on Long Island, whose son has disappeared somewhere in Italy, and would Ripley want to find him and convince him to return to New York... At this point we are 10 minutes of Episode 1.Couple of comments: this is written, produces and directed by Steve Zaillian, whose script for Schindler's List won an Oscar. Here Zaiilian revisits Patricia Highsmith's books on the conman that was Tom Ripley. Like many of you, I watched the 1999 movie starring Matt Damon, and quite liked it. But let me state right away that there is zero doubt in my mind that this 2024 mini-series is superior to the 1999 movie. For one, the script for this mini-series is very strong. It may bother some people that this is slow-paced. I for one am very grateful for that, as we get to see the characters fully develop before our eyes. It also apparently bothers some that the mini-series in shot entirely in B&W. I happen to think this works very well, considering the setting (early 60s). (As an aside, Zaillian has stated that the cover of a Ripley book he read had a B&W photo which inspired him to shoot the series in B&W.) Last and certainly not least, the production sets are exquisite (look at all of the details). And quite helpful is the very strong cast, including Andrew Scott as Ripley, Johnny Flynn as Dickie, and an unrecognizable Dakota Fanning as Marge.""Ripley"" started streaming on Netflix last weekend, and I watched it spread over 3 evenings. The mini-series is currently rated 85% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes and that sounds about right to me. If you have any interest in the Ripley character or are simply in the mood for an engaging mini-series about a conman, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion."
1	Forty + year old rookie, acts like he has no life experience in a number of situations. Couldn't park the car in one episode.
0	Loved season 1 and 2, but I find the writing of Season 3 to be very bad. The writers seem more interested in pandering towards certain political agendas than creating interesting storylines and good TV.I like Nathan Fillion as an actor, and I think also many of the other cast-members are good, however the material that was given to Brandon Routh for instance was so ham-handed and shallow the end result will be cringeworthy nevertheless.
1	This is a sci-fi series from the creator of Game of Thrones that adapts a Hugo award-winning Chinese novel, but with almost all the characters changed to Westerners. It keeps only the major plot events and the Chinese female lead character from the beginning. While this aspect is done well, it completely loses the deeper Chinese political science content of the original. And viewers of the series cannot then go read the original novel. Additionally, the newly created characters become a group of drunken scientists full of Western-style personal life and romantic issues, which is an unnecessary aspect that the show labors on throughout. This greatly reduces the value of the original work. (The previous Chinese TV series version on WeTV was much more faithful to the original novel.)
2	Wow! I loved it, keep up the good writing, the good plot lines & the relationships of the characters as they settle into their roles & we've got an entertaining hour of tv!
0	Oh man was this dissapointing. I will not watch beyond episode 3. I just don't care anymore. One of the 10/10 shows ruined, thanks Dumb and Dumber.
2	Baby Reindeer Netflix 2024. 7 episodes of varying length. Up to 4 hours worth. Wow, Powerful stuff, wanna be comedian Donny Dunn, befriends a lost soul in Martha, who becomes besotted with him. To the point of obsession, she begins stalking him. How does Donny cope, he feels sorry for her that's how. The back story is more powerful, at first Martha is a figure of fun for Donny colleagues in the bar where he works. We slowly watch Donny' life rise and fall, parallel to the mutual obsession, that is slowly building between the two main protagonist. Fuelled by social media, and the reliance of mobile phones, this goes into some dark places. Donny finds the only person he can truly relate to and trust is his stalker Martha. She understands Donny and his demons.This is a great story and will be talked about by all who see it. 9/10.
0	I couldn't get past how unlikeable the protagonist is.***Spoilers***The synopsis implies that he's targeted by a stalker, but in reality, he's the one who initiates the stalking and creates all of his own problems for himself. He's a liar, a loser, and generally someone that is impossible to root for. I'm all for flawed protagonists, but this guy - despite having a superficial gentleness about him - is really just a creepy dude with a victim complex who lies to women, stalks them, leads them on, and then makes a surprise Pikachu face when his life is not so good as a result of his own bad decisions. The stalker lady was honestly more sympathetic in comparison, believe it or not.Wish I had positive things to say.
1	The first seasons do not mentioned about race, everybody was the same, no diffeerence betwen white, black, hispanic. Now It is too bored with the race card 😒
1	Interesting police drama, Nathan does his best to portray a middle aged man starting a second career as a cop. The biggest problem is, the cops in the show don't follow correct procedures, and it's easily apparent that the show is designed to entertain the adolescent minds that think comic books make great movies. Lots of violent interactions, i.e., the gang that couldn't shoot straight seems to be the criminals in every shoot 'em up episode. As in, the whole mob of gunmen who can't hit a single cop, despite them all having submachine guns. And no one gets hit by a single bullet? Really? But than you have cops doing things just as ignorant, ignoring procedure and then getting hurt because of it. Is this supposed to make criminals think this is how real law enforcement works? Gee, I hope so.As is common, what we see here is mostly stupid people doing stupid things. If that is what you are looking for, well then this show is for you. Our 5th and 6th grade kids and their friends love it. The adults, not so much; and it's not the violence that's upsetting, it's the incredible ignorance and foolishness of the supposedly adult, educated officers in the show.
1	I think japanese historians are reviewing this show, its good in places, like an epic film I suppose, but in other places there is just way too much talking between mundane characters, i had to skip it, it was just so BORING. It honestly seems like a history show sometimes, maybe it will pick up and get better, the trailer is impressive, but getting through some of the first 2 episodes is.....painful in places, why do I have to write so much, some times i see reviews that are 100 characters long, how is that happening? I wish this was like that, oh Anna Sawai looks beautiful in the show, better than in godzilla. Which hmm was also mostly boring !
1	"Positives: The show is well made. Production value is great. I personally like a slow tempo, setting things up and unravelling the mystery bit by bit. Some cast choices I really liked.The bad stuff: Some of the characters fall flat, and painfully so. Just not working for me, and I can sense their ""on camera vibe"", so I guess it's not working for them either. Not sure if it's casting, directing, script or the source material.I just finished episode 5 and it brings up bad memories. I only read the 3rd book of the series, after picking it up at a train station for a longer journey. Some aspects were really good, some were just awful. Especially the one-dimensional characterisation of women.Episode 5 and the ""Ship Scene"" really reminded me of how nonsensical the plot can be, based on the many shortcomings of the source material.So... this is the ONLY way to solve the issue? Watch it and you know what I mean.What I hated about the book the most: The romantic partner of the main character was such a hollow, lifeless side-note, only there to deliver prompts so the author could clean up a completely pointless emotional growth journey for the man.The metaphorical fig leaf over the not-so-metaphorical plot holes.Overall: watchable if you're bored. Infuriating, if you forget to switch off your brain."
2	The end ruined it all for me. It reminds me of lost, you can't judge it anymore without thinking of the ending and I wouldn't recommend it to my friends knowing how bad they handled it in the end. Wow just, wow I don't regret the ride, but I have never seen such a good show fall apart like this. I guess the checks have been cashed who cares about artistic integrity
0	Started out pretty good, but gets worse and worse each season. Becomes just another sex and liberal-issues obsessed show. Near every episode has people basically jumping into the closest closet or empty room to get it on - while at work in the hospital. In later seasons, they really push the lesbian relationships hard - over and over. If you binge watch, all the sex-at- work and alternative-lifestyles-presented-as-normal-and-widespread get much harder to overlook. And then on top of that, all the hardcore liberal political stories that start to get shoved in with zero subtlety or fairness. Another show where the creators take their initial success as an opportunity to cram their viewpoints and twisted morality down your throat instead of just keeping on with what they were doing good at. I'd say it started out as an 8, but last few have dropped to a 4 at best.
1	This show had some really interesting ideas and concepts. It could've gone really far. But each episode just keeps introduces the beginning of a sentence, without finishing it. It's never finished. Not even in the last episode. Which was epically disappointing, introduced even more questions with absolutely no answers, follow up, or solution. I hate when shows do this. I don't even know if there's a second season...if there's more seasons then this is just ok. Still incredibly unsatisfying. If there's no more seasons, then wtf even was this? Epically pointless.Lots of potential, lots of interesting thoughts, but in the end you're left empty.
1	"I didn't plan to check out ""Sugar,"" a neo-noir TV series about a private detective, which didn't sound interesting at all.There were many red flags suggesting it would be subpar, including the name ""Sugar,"" which follows the cliché of having a name that also has another meaning, like ""Monk,"" ""Magnum,"" or ""Castle,"" among others.It started in black and white, which, in my opinion, should only be used for flashbacks and is narrated in the first person.Nonetheless, I gave it a chance, and it somehow started growing on me.This production definitely tries to incorporate every trick and cliché in the book. The private eye is sick, dislikes guns, drives a vintage car, dresses the same every day, and only searches for missing persons. There are even meta jokes, including the hero entering a bar named 007.At the same time, it tries to be different with some unusual cinematography angles, like those from a TikTok video shot with Insta360 cameras. Despite the scant information provided about his background, past, and personality, the main character is almost paper-thin, yet you find yourself starting to like him and wanting to follow his story.This is an advantageous role for Colin Farrell, but he owns it well. Amy Ryan also delivers a strong performance as a lonely alcoholic.Overall, I will keep watching, even though I hadn't planned to. It's a 'construct,' not a solid series-too many clichés thrown together, but somehow, I didn't change the channel."
1	Initially a huge fan but these embarrassing beach flashbacks in season 17 are cringeworthy. Perhaps, unfortunately, without new writers, the time has sadly come to admit defeat and wave goodbye.
2	"Once again, Netflix goes out on a limb to reach beyond the predictable feelgood fair so many want - and possibly need - in dawn of dystopian age we find ourselves living in. Baby Reindeer is tagged as a dark comedy, and there are certainly comic aspects to it, but it is steeped - almost mired - in tragedy that already I'm hearing as misunderstood by viewers dismissing it as ""unfunny."" describing the tragic protagonist as ""self absorbed"" and ""lazy."" I found Donny neither of these, but rather twisted with self-hatred and crippled by indecisiveness. We sense his desire to be wanted and loved, fully aware aware that in his eyes he is unworthy of either.As Donny, Richard Gadd's Donny gives among of the most harrowing, frustrating and ultimately heartbreaking performances I've seen this year. Lanky and raw, his eyes, mouth and jaw move constantly from a place of fear that is set across his scraggly bearded, hollow face, both handsome and homely. Every thought, every emotion plays across his mask in direct opposition of the poker face he imagines hides the true Donny.The pathetic journey of this failing and flailing comic becomes painful to witness - almost unbearable at times, but that is the point isn't it? To show what real suffering is, to reveal that complete inability to move forward because one is held back by fear and hatred. This level of self-loathing is addictive and isn't meant to be pretty or funny. It isn't. It cannot be. It's made manifest through the jokes that die before they're emitted from his lips, from the juvenile props that fail to offer any comic relief from the torment. And yet, he goes on, confusing the familiar humiliation of his life as a kind of comfort.I grew frustrated to the point of anger with Donny, thinking ""there are easy fixes, mate . . . Just buck up, be honest be . . ."" before realizing how many years I spent telling myself those same things. How frequently my looking in the mirror, telling myself ""it's an easy fix, mate,"" when the reality was not only wasn't it not easy, there are times where there seemed to be no fix at all. Ever. Gadd captures this paralyzing inability with such poignancy I more than once found myself unable to hold back tears. At long last comes the moment of self-confrontation one sensed had to happen to make this all work. Without knowing Mr. Gadd, all I can say is, he brings us to that place where actor and character fuse into a oneness, something so beautifully raw, so abraded that can only be seen as a revelation, a catharsis. Yes, it's acting, masterful even, but it feels is more than that as well. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't want to know.On the opposite side of that same coin is the chilling, harrowingly raw portrayal of Martha by Jessica Gunning. It is incredibly easy to dislike a creature such as Martha . . . Manipulative, foul, deceitful, and wonder why Donny allows himself to be torturously abused by her at every turn. But we know why don't we? First and foremost, he pities her but it's more than that. He, unwittingly at first recognizes that, beneath the surface, Martha is the same emotional ticking time bomb as he. Gunning brilliantly uses her face to convey elation, naughtiness, rage, pain and emotional blankness with an ease of facility equal to Gadd's Donny. Indeed, the two make an uncomfortably powerful match in Baby Reindeer.Time prevents me from going on, but I must at least in passing say that , Nava Mau, Nina Sosanya, Tom Goodman-Hill, Shalom Brune-Franklin, all give sensational performances in supporting roles that contribute to and flesh out this dark, powerful story.One of Netflix best in several years.."
1	Loved the cast and acting and the westworld ish vibes but with an appropriate comic book feel.Amazing score and Nolan/Joy world building ok with what I presume was a much smaller budget. I get similar vibes occasionally especially with the Walter Goggins Ghoul reminiscent of man in black. He's so good and I really like the lead actress. She has those big eyes and looks straight out of an anime.My pet peeve is how did all those post apocalptic people keep their glasses crystal clear.not to mention clean hair. I look like a hobo after two days without a shower.I'm not a gamer so can't speak to how this reflects to the game lore.
1	"It is excellent as a soapie with character development. Exposing their ""real"" side as the story progresses, if that is believable; it does keep it interesting..This isn't a realistic portrayal of anything LE. One episode they are shooting bad guys in the legs, the next episode they wouldn't be able to hit a barn door.There are some continuity issues, but given the low bar on all entertainment these days, i suppose we can/should accept that(?)I like Nathan Fillion, with him being an actor, and a human being, but his character would have been better as a shrink, not a police officer.It isn't a bad show, but it is Hollywood (as the protagonist mentions a few times)."
0	I actually don't understand how this show has such a good rating, It's just too much drama; and not the good one with which you feel the actors pain... no, it's the cheesy one; sometimes even pathetic. I watched several season, just because my girlfriend liked it and I can properly say that it doesn't describe at all how being a doctor is and the quantity of natural disasters or weird emergency's that happen each season, is just to much... The thing that disappointed me the most was the actors. I mean when you see the cast you expect a very decent acting here, and don't get me wrong some of them do a good job in some episodes or season, for example Chandra Wilson does a very good job in the first season, but the main character, the ''star'' of the show is just awful... For me there are to many cons and not enough pros, if the show is on TV and you have nothing to do you might watch an episode, but this is not a show that will be remembered when the years pass... Trust me...
0	This show used to be really good. The last few episodes I couldn't even finish watching. They bring race into everything and feed off the media agenda to make all cops look bad.
0	As long as you are willing to admit to yourself this is Hollywood, and be willing to suspend reality you will find this entertaining. Now I am not talking about massively ridiculous inaccuracies, just your typical Hollywood inaccuracies. For instance, the typical Hollywood way of portraying the use of force by law enforcement. Reality is the following, if a criminal has a weapon drawn or tries to draw a weapon, law enforcement will immediately shoot you. Hollywood shows law enforcement telling people to put the weapon down when a like is under threat. Law enforcement only does that if distance, or additional movement would be required for an immediate threat to life to exist. I cant help but wonder if Hollywood has changed the public's expectations or perceptions of how law enforcement reacts to resistance. I also wonder if this Hollywood induced misconception has led to life threatening problems between the public and police.
2	This tv adaptation of the talented Mr Ripley has been filmed in a Hitchcock style in black and white around the cities and countryside of Italy. Obviously having Andrew Scott in it has a great appeal. However, it starts slow, very slow and actually Scott's Ripley isn't very likeable. I wondered why spend hours watching this when I could watch the film? In fact initially Ripley really has so little appeal and I was wondering if this might be a different spin on the plot where he isn't talented? Keep watching though it is immensely enjoyable once you get into it. Without spoiling anything you may watch astounded at some of the characters (policemen) and their laziness or bad luck, yet it slowly spins a plot and spins faster towards an ending. You will be satisfied by the ending and the cameo by a former Ripley. So indulge and be patient, travel to Italy and get unexplainable wealth.
1	I miss Alex in Pediatrics. Miranda as a strong leader. April in the ER. Cali breaking bones. Meredith and two young guys is unrealistic. Give her a mature man that respects her and her kids and allows her time to operate and research. That's what a tired single mom of 3 really wants. When did this stop being a medical drama and become a soap opera entitled the Weber/Averys standing around talking about a tumor for several episodes. Give me some more medicial drama and less standing around talking. Less grey more Gray!!
1	Season 1: 9.5/10 Season 2: 8.5/10 Season 3: 3.0/10 Season 4: --/10.7.0/10.First season: Everyone work together against the crime, even if it costs your life.Second season: Everyone can be friends and work together against the crime, but take care who you trust, there might be some bad apples.Third season: Everyone is good, except the whites.
2	I would have scored it with a 10 if the end had not treated the best characters so disrespectfully. It was devastating to see a forced end, steamed, and also did not honor the great previous development of the characters
2	Although an utterly engrossing and fascinating story, what is so memorable about this is how it looks. Over the years films and TV shows have often tried to be arty, frequently resulting in pompous and cringy pretentiousness. Without wanting to sound pretentious myself, this is the truest most beautiful piece of art I've seen for many a year. It gives you that same awe inspiring feeling of amazement as when you walk into St Vitus Cathedral or see the Taj Mahal for the first time.This is as close to perfection as you can get but to be critical and needlessly picky, I suppose it could be said that it feels a little slow at times. Audiences used to fast moving, all-action dramas might not appreciate this as much as some of us. That pace which gradually ramps up is necessary. It allows you not just to get to know Ripley (played brilliantly by Andrew Scott) but to get to know exactly how he feels and what he's thinking. The genius of this production is that we find ourselves rooting for Ripley, a thoroughly detestable human being. He's got no redeeming features whatsoever yet as much as we grow to passionately detest him, we find ourselves hoping against hope that he's going to get away with it all. It's so exceptionally well written that we're taken on the journey with him and all of his emotional experiences and anxieties.Is it right to enjoy such unpleasantness?
2	I'm really enjoying this show, I only have one and a half episodes left.I don't have much knowledge of the game, but as the show goes , it is way better than most shows coming out nowadays.I love that this show is not afraid to show character flaws and they do a good job of showing how ppl turn out based off life experiences. It is refreshing to see characters that have to over come adversity. It is a very much needed break from what Hollywood has done to female leads and their male counter parts in the last few years.The only character/ issue that I am having is Maximus. It took me a while to pinpoint what bothered me about the character, and I think it's the fact that he reminds me of a confused and angry teenager that is just now learning the ways of the world. His emotions go back and forth too much for me and his actions don't feel consistent. It doesn't help that I can't for the life of me figure out how old he is supposed to be. I assumed he was a 45 to 50 year old man when he was first introduced, this gave me a certain expectation in behavior, so I was caught off guard when he started acting the way he did, he seemed bitter, immature, and naive at times, brave sometimes , but other times a complete coward, they tried to make him look like a good guy, but his actions said otherwise.Anyway, I just found out that he is 34 in real life so he was probably 33 when he filmed.. I guess I'll find out for sure how old he is once I watch the last 2 episodes.Other than that, I'm loving the show, and the whole Maximus thing doesn't bother me too much, but it does take me out of the show every now and then.
2	Do hope this series will get another season. I never play the game but do know bout bits and pieces of the lore (thank you video essay) and this series is very entertaining and well done.The story is engaging. Simple and yet amazingly well put. The violence is very... violent. Over the top, lots of gruesome stuffs that made me look away from the screen or just cringe, but like it fits the wasteland and the situation they are in.Theres only an editing error or like splicing (?) that doesn't make sense and put me out of the story, but other than that, I enjoyed every minute of it. Kinda sad that the s1 is finish and who knows when the next season will be out.I like the characters. Lucy is very nice as a protagonist. She started as someone who is quite naive because of her upbringing to become a survivor without truly losing herself.I love the ghoul character, though it reminded me so much of that character in westworld.I also love the musics and the retro 60s aesthethic contrasted with apocalypse. Always something I enjoyed to see from the fallout games.Also big shout to the best girl, the doggo. Cx404 / Dogmeat, you are amazing.
0	Having never played the game I am scoring, and reviewing, this solely on the merits of the TV show, and compared to other shows (for example Halo, Into the Badlands, Shadows and Bones), it tries too hard to look and feel dystopian to maintain suspension of disbelief.Every opportunity is used to play some old 50's/60's music could not more feel like someone got a free jukebox and insists that it be used in every scene, even when the music has zero bearing on the scenes and does nothing to evoke the feelings the director undoubtedly intended to invoke.I might give it a chance to see how it develops but based on just the first two episodes it's a hard storyline to follow and any and all cohesion between the different storylines to allow non-Fallout-gamers to get seemed to have gotten lost in translation, with too much time spent on trying to force feed you the rather poorly presented misery of the world, instead of using that time to let the dystopian-ness reveal itself through solid story-telling.
0	You'll feel right at home with this show. It went from sewer to sewer searching out totally meaningless drivel storylines.
0	I dont know who is giving this garbage such high ratings. I suppose some pot smoking artsy film making wannabes mesmerized by the black and white cinematography?Slow and boring doesnt begin to describe this dribble. Poor casting? Holy canoli (see what I did there?). The guy playing Greenleaf Sr.... I think I just saw him in a Wal Mart commercial.The lead has absolutely zero character or charisma, especially if we're to buy him as a grifter.If you can sit through eight episodes of this you must be partially comatose. I have to believe the high raters are affiliated with the producers of this masterpiece of nothing.
1	Best series of all time. Until the last season. Plot line was rushed. Character developments were destroyed. Plot lines cheaply tied off or forgotten. Equivalent of Lord of the rings characters reaching Mordor - Then a asteroid hits and blows up the world.
0	I was excited for season 2. This season has been annoyingly eye rolling. The Harper character is so out of bounds it's absurd. The story has gone too far Hollywood. I understand the show is a drama and isn't a real life portrayal of actual police work in LA but this has gone too far. This show is garbage now. Just my opinion.
2	The detail and accuracy of the time makes this an unforgettable watch, as well as the graphic depictions of warfare and violence. Characterisation is strong and makes you finding sympathy/apathy alike for the array of characters presented. It may be somewhat predictable in places, especially between the 2 main male/female leads, which is my only criticism, but otherwise this is a worthy series. Cosmo Jarvis is very watchable; enigmatic and carries himself through well despite the unfamiliar landscape and terrain. Over half way through and it seems to be heading for an epic showdown, that I hope is not predictable.
0	Just remake the final battle where the Night King wins and destroys the earth.
0	Well, I most definitely loved the book, but the series... It's okay, but somehow, I expected so much more. The first four episodes is where it all seems to happen, and the binary army computer is just beautifully made - guess crowd simulation often seems to do the trick. Episodes five to eight seem a bit of a timewaster with nothing much happening in them. Looking forward seeing The Dark Forest and Death's End, but not sure if it will be holding up to my expectations. Anyways, it's not a bad Netflix production, but it's also not one of their best. Believe that series like the Queen's Gambit would have been a whole lot less expensive to produce with ultimately a better impact. Think in this case the book still has my personal preference, but who knows, Netflix may up their game and rethink their strategy for the next two books. It just needs to be a whole lot better than this. So, not bad, but not holding up to the book.
0	The novel of Shogun originally written by James Clavell was based on the writings of William Adams, who was the first Englishman to set foot in Japan and became the trusted adviser of Japanese shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. William Adams is still a celebrated figure in Japan for building and bring western trader to the Japans. The Blackthorne character in the novel is bright, inquisitive, principled and driven. Well played by Richard Chamberlain in 1980. Maybe it was the script or the actor Cosmo Jarvis but the Blackthorne in this version is inept, mercenary and clumsy for lack of a better term. Mr Jarvis' characterization couldn't build a fire without help. It's fortunate that this iteration changed the focus on to the indigenous principals and not the Blackthorne character but it still skimmed over the palace intrigue. Also missing is Father Alvito who should be the hero when the novel is viewed in terms of Clavell's Objectivist philosophy. Toranaga played well by Hiroyuki Sanada lacks the ruthlessness of Tokugawa Ieyasu who was the real Shogun. The show is a good attempt to tell a great story but some of the characters are just not up to the challenge.
2	"As a longtime fan of Fallout, especially New Vegas and 4, I was looking forward to this series since I saw the trailer a month prior. I binge watched the entire series in two days, and I wasn't disappointed at all.In typical Fallout fashion, the story takes place in on a post-nuclear apocalyptic world, particularly the ruins of Los Angeles, California. We follow three main, widely varying, protagonists.First, there's Lucy Maclean, a naive but determined and idealistic Vault Dweller who leaves her home, Vault 3, to find her father who was abducted by a Raider chieftain named Moldaver.Next, there's Maximus, a downtrodden aspirant of the Brotherhood of Steel who gets unexpectedly promoted to squire.And finally, we have Howard Cooper aka The Ghoul, the most cynical, jaded, and experienced protagonist who was once a pre-war actor before becoming a mercenary after the apocalypse.You'll also see longtime Fallout canine character, Dogmeat for you dog-lovers out there.The main plot of first season revolves around a wild-goose chase for the severed head of a scientist named Dr. Wilzig, which carries a big secret that could change the entire world. From there, the main story expands into a few sub plots for each character in an immerse and creative manner.First of all, the aesthetic was superb and fully captured the game in every category. From the Vault to the wasteland, to the very items, weapons, enemies, items, etc. Everything matches the source material. You'll almost feels like you're playing a Fallout game as you watch the show. Plus, the action sequences were as exciting as they were fitting for a Fallout setting. Longtime fans will definitely be reminded of their past combat experiences with the slow motion intervals.There was plenty of character development and interactions among all three characters. Lucy becomes tougher and more hardened by the harsh realities of the wasteland (among other things). Maximus becomes disillusioned with the Brotherhood, yet ironically a respected member in the process, and even forms a romance with Lucy, and Cooper eventually transforms from an enemy to an uneasy ally to Lucy as they continue their journey.The music was a captivating mix of different sources. There is an original soundtrack by Ramin Djawadi, who took inspiration from Fallout composer Inon Zur himself. Plus, you'll hear multiple original songs and leitmotifs that any Fallout fan with recognize from past games, and plenty of golden oldies from real musical artists such as Johnny Cash, Dinah Washington, and The Inkspots.The special effects were a breathtaking mixture of CGI and practical effects that fully capture the Fallout universe. The mutant creatures, such as Radroaches, Gulpers, and a Yao Guai. Personally, I can't wait to see a Deathclaw. I especially liked the Brotherhood Knights dressed in their T-60 power armor suits.Overall, this show succeeded where ""Halo"" failed and is a must watch for Fallout fans or just about anyone interested in the post-apocalyptic genre."
2	"Season 1 is good, Season 2 even better. Season 3: I genuinely like and appreciate as they are having the characters interact and goof around more. There is more explanation to smaller details of the cop routine and their rules. They didn't ""Hollywood ending"" Nathan Fillion's character to a mistake he made in Season 2. I honestly thought they would this season 3. Instead, a new character arch for him as well as a couple of the other Rookies and seasoned training officers. I find it odd they (the bad reviews about the show ""going woke"" or downhill) expect a cop show to continue with out addressing any issues that are going on today. I particularly really liked Season 3, episode 9, called Amber. They intelligently addressed many of the issues/questions today's cops have to deal with. I was genuinely really impressed with how they made that work into the show and how it was handled. Take my advice, take the bad reviews of season 3 with a grain of salt. This is a genuinely good show with sincere intentions of wanting you to understand the life, big or small problems, of a cop."
1	Way too much camera movement, unbelievable scenes, model-like cops. Booming music just in case you could tell that it's so...exciting! Everything a mediocre Hollywood studio would include in a script. Definitely not an 8/10 show as the current rating suggests. At best a 5.
2	This is not one of the normal boring soap operas. Me and my girlfriend watched one episode and after that we were hooked. This will force you to wait all week for Tuesday night to see what is waiting for you in Grey's anatomy.It is about 5 inturn doctors at a hospital, and you follow their work life as well as their private life. There is really nothing special to the content and we know it from other productions as well. But it just have something special. Maybe it is a combination of the way the story is told, combined with good actors. Maybe it just have that unexplainable IT. If you haven't seen this yet I'll strongly recommend you to give it a try.
1	"Firstly, and this applies to the games as well, 200 years is way too far-fetched. Industrialized civilizations could have risen twice-over. It gives me the impression the games, and thus this show, were originally designed for 20 years after the war. Enough time for a post-war generation to reach adulthood and entropy to catch-up to vault-dwellers, but then some seagull flew in and went ""no, make it TWO HUNDRED YEARS!!"", but by then it was too late to change all the artwork. So mentally knock a zero off that number and it'll go-down more easily.Ayways, the show is a mild dark comedy set in a fantasy retro-future, but a little slow at times, a little sparse with the comedy.Lucy worked well as a sheltered vault-dweller and she evolves over the series. Maximus is an interesting flawed character, not likable but clearly has some growing-up to do. Howard is Cad Bane. Dogmeat had way more personality than in the game, but they missed a golden opportunity with the booby-traps (searh: goddamn it dogmeat)... maybe next season.The Brotherhood were well portrayed, though they kinda glossed over the purity thing, and having a lame old-man in-charge didn't quite fit with their might-is-right ideology. Vault dwellers were a bit too hammy, not enough internal farce & own-goals as suggested by the games. We don't see much of the Enclave or other factions.There's only one robot, and there are no orcs (aka super-mutants), which is probably for the best given the current state of vfx. Mr Gutsy was sorely missed, as was some of the vicious anti-communist rhetoric from the games. Also missing was the all-important looting. Not looting a corpse naked is a bit of a Fallout faux pas, likewise not carrying-off the entire contents of a lair.The story is pretty tiresome: yet another daddy-issues production (I often wonder why Americans pump-out so many of these). There's some mystery surrounding the vaults and a certain raider, but with the usual predictable we're the baddies outcome. The games had similar problems, but at least there you could completely ignore it to do your own thing, especially Fallout4 (2014). Here we're forced to ride along Lucy's linear monothreaded quest for her dad, which in itself didn't feel compelling as we don't know much about either of them, even by the end. The story of Maximus was more interesting as his mistakes & lies start to snowball into a Flashmanesque victory, but again we really don't know enough about the character to care that much. Bane was more fleshed out, but so at odds with his pre-war persona, will be interesting to see how/why he became so cruel. I suspect Lucy's dad represents an amalgam the player from the different games, given the trail of destruction in his wake.Besides the excellent robot, Vfx here was pretty distracting, like early 00's BSG cylons distracting. Milky cataract compositing, white skies, softglows, poorly animated power-armor, unfinished gulpers and the deep dark abyss of Howard's gaping nose-hole. After witnessing all of this I go back to look at Transformers (2007 - seventeen years ago) and lament: ""what happened to you vfx, you used to be beautiful"".Sets were mostly great, but ruined by the cg in many cases. Lighting was all over the place, from natural sunlit to overcast to stage lit, sometimes in the same sequence. There were no radstorms. Costumes & props were nowhere near as good as those in Fallout4, some of the BG & minor characters looked like cosplayers, and quite a few were well-fed & indoorsy.Music was either great (historical recordings) or forgettable (the rest). The scene with the 'music critics' was hilarious."
1	I used to love Grey's Anatomy except for the stupid McDreamy nonsense, but these last 2 seasons have really gone downhill in my opinion.There's just no depth to the show anymore. The writing isn't great, even the acting seems lackluster to me. And this season finale felt rushed & far reaching. Like they didn't know where to go with the episode so they just patched things together.It feels more like a cheap soap opera now whereas it didn't feel like that to me when it first started.Even the ending within the season finale was like what??? I didn't feel ANY chemistry between the 2 of them at any point this season, & this is the direction you are going in??? Really????It all seems VERY desperate to keep a dead show running.
2	This was a slow burner. So much so, I had to watch it twice. But it has a lot going for it. No surprise that the cinematography, and general storyboarding is excellent, but the story itself brings some novel concepts to sci fi. I think astrophysics undergrad courses are going to feel the effects of this series... Without wrecking it for everyone, the story and concept is excellent, believable, and up there with Dune. There are many great moments, and some great black humor but the end of life scene acting was phenomenal and heart wrenching. And Eiza Gonzalez...Well , and I've probably wrecked it now, but I have to say she is the hottest girl in sci-fi I've ever seen. Hotter even than seven of nine.I can't wait for the next 3 series if they get the go ahead. There is just so much scope left in this story. 400+ years of scope, in fact.
1	"I understand that the original story was so complicated that it was not possible to fit it all into one season series. Netflix had to make some deft adaptations to make it work, cutting some characters or amalgamating some into one. However, they felt it was important to incorporate a romantic sub-plot, which had nothing to do with the original story. This changed the genre from a hard sci-fi to a romantic, light sci-fi, coming-of-age story.The casting choices were terrible, especially for Auggie. I HATED this actress's selection so much. No offense to scientists out there, but there is no way on Earth a top scientist would look like a 23-year-old supermodel with super-long eyelashes and filled-in duck lips. If they did, then I would be worried about the research they conduct. She does not emit an aura of intelligence befitting a scientist character, making the role very hard to believe. The Chinese roles were OK, while there was something off with Jin; again, he doesn't look too smart either, but much better than Auggie. All the faces look too ""San Francisco"" to be believable, and the ""represent all ethnicities"" agenda is very strong here.The story was so rushed that the ""epic"" feeling from the book is gone. Some of the dialogues are unnecessary and make the tone of the story feel like a teenager drama.If you have never read the book, you might enjoy this adaptation. If you are a hard sci-fi lover and have read the book, you better avoid this adaptation."
0	I think it was not right that people are led to believe this is a stalking story. Yes there is stalking but I felt it was not the main theme and there was no message that could be helpful for those who are going through this problem. It was more about Richard's life and I am not sure if all this was a cynical move from him to get fame - after all he would do anything for that as he said himself. I found this story quite weak and I didn't emphatise with his character at all. I felt some scenes were also too violent when there was no need for it.The only likeable character was Teri and but again part of her storyline there was weak because surely she could have sued Martha for the aggression.Overall, I liked the first two episodes and that's it.
2	So just watched baby reindeer and oh my god. This is one of them limited series that once you start you can not stop. There are moments in this show that are so funny but then in the next breath so sad. It is had to put it in a category of what it is as it covers so many topics. The Acting is superb and the fact it is based on a true story makes it even more so crazy. It realy shines a light on how the world thinks and acts sometimes. There are some realy gard to watch moments in this but if you can get through them then this a must watch. It's only 7 parts and most have a run time of 30 mins.
2	Season 1-6= 10/10 Season 7= 8/10 Season 8= 6/10Season 1-6 of Game Of Thrones is masterful, some of the best Television, or story I have seen. Character deaths, shocking, engaging, fantastic dialogue, incredible twists, intense, awesome battles, violent, incredible story and nuanced and complex characters with incredible world building and characters that you just fall in love with, with incredible arcs (Jaime, Cersei, Jon, Tyrion, Danerys, Robb, Ned etc) There is no other TV Show Like Game Of Thrones 1st 6 seasons, no other tv shows gives you the same feeling as episodes such as- Baelor, The Rains Of Castamere, Blackwater, Battle Of The Bastards, Laws Of Gods And Men, The Winds Of Winter, Hardhome, Mother's Mercy etc. Game Of Thrones S1-6 are easily a 10/10.Season 7 isn't as good as those 6 seasons, its still great television with awesome episodes such as The Spoils Of War and 'The Dragon And The Wolf' and Jaimie and Cersei Lannister are the best they've been (my personal favourite 2 characters). But the pacing feels a bit off, ep 5 and 6 feel rushed, disjointed and more generic. It's a set up season for S8 and while its still a great season of TV, you can see where it started to go a bit downhill. Still a solid entry in the GOT Saga.Season 8 is hugely disappointing, Great battles, music, production and acting. the story, characters, pacing and writing are not good. It's too crammed with too many stories and characters to fit in only 6 episodes and The ending of The Long Night negates the entire theme of Game Of Thrones, leaving for a disappointing 2nd half. Also, what they did with Jaimie Lanister and The Night King is unforgivable, GOT always shocked fans with great twists, but in S8 it's shocking at the expense of telling a good story.Even tho S8 is disappointing, GOT is still absolutely worth the watch, its one of a kind TV Show and the first 7 seasons are 100% worth watching.
0	"This is my first review on IMDB.I recently read the book and found it enormously difficult to finish. There are dozens of characters. They all (with the exception of Ye Wenjie) seemed like human icebergs, no soul, no layers. The pace of the book is chaotic, full of science that honestly bored me. I'm a fan of Asimov, Sagan, Kaku, Stephen Hawking ... but the way Cixin Liu delivers the science seemed pompous and worthy of a draft. Let's see, Asimov, one of the most brilliant minds of humanity, when he wrote fiction, he cared about plot, about logic, about characters, and he didn't need to throw all his science wisdom at us; he did that in his non-fiction books.Also, for a book that claims to be extremely scientific, it feels outdated and incongruous. I thought the Netflix series would improve these aspects, that it would at least heat up such a cold book, and they partly did, but the story of the book is what it is. And on top of that, they added aspects that also make little sense (even from the other two books) yet simply make the plot holes become black holes.True, some characters in the series are somewhat Soap Opera-like, etc. But there are bigger problems: the main plot. The biggest problem with the series is the story as such, and this is because of the book.1.- If Ye Wenjie receives a warning signal from a race that is theoretically incapable of lying, warning her at least five times not to respond, then why is there any hope for the Lord? The signal is warning her that they are going to invade them, and Ye thinks it's salvation? No, Ye thinks it's punishment and that humans deserve to be annihilated. But neither in the book, nor in the Netflix series do they develop this dilemma well. Sometimes, you think Ye made the choice for the sake of humanity in the long run, sometimes simply for retribution. It could be both options, but it doesn't make much sense. Why is Ye astonished when the San-ti call humans ""bugs"" if they warned her from the beginning that they would go after them?2.- How is it possible that scientists commit suicide just because their data doesn't add up? That doesn't befit a scientist. Science faces challenges all the time. Just now, the Webb is causing a stir in the scientific community, and that is exciting, not depressing. In the series and in the book, the scientists act more like mystics who have lost faith, rather than scientists who want to dig deeper and deeper. In the real world, they may feel frustrated, defeated, for a moment, but mass suicide? Nope. If it is because the San-ti are manipulating their minds directly, then all is lost, because the San-ti can do the same to the prominent leaders of humanity, etc. If it is simply because of the failure of science at certain points, suicide by scientists is unrealistic and absurd.If you need to remove a hard disk from a ship, how is it possible that the best solution is to use nanofibers and to kill everybody? After all, nanofibers are only very powerful and very small blades. The odds of the nanofiber also destroying the hard drive are almost 100 percent. Besides, there were children on that ship. On the other hand, wasn't it better to perform a surgical operation and catch Mike Evans ( ghastly underdeveloped) and seize the technology that was on the ship, the hard drive, etc.? That whole scene makes no sense; it's there just for the Wow effect. Also, for a scientist to lend herself to this, after so much struggle, is a terrible decision for the character.4.- The Sophon is the end of the game. The San-ti can know everything humans do and manipulate what they see. They can make the stars twinkle, place an eye in the sky, make the sky look like a mirror. So isn't it obvious that they can make humanity destroy itself in a few years? It is extremely simple for them. The options are endless. They can collapse power plants, water plants. They can alter atomic bombs (more or less a la Skynet in Terminator)... Besides, if the sophon watches over humans, how come the San-ti didn't know that humans lie? And with the sophon, it's impossible for humans to strategize, since the sophon will always know everything.5.- For the convenience of the script and the book, the sophon cannot read minds. But then again, it doesn't need to. Well, after such a plot hole, humans publicly say they are going to create the walfacer project. Another project that makes no sense. This is from the second book. Dark Forest. SPOILERS FROM, BOOK TWO START HERE!!!!Let's see, that book was written in 2008, before Kepler and Webb. Now we know there are thousands of planets (only in the Milky Way) and many of them could be like Earth. The Dark Forest theory to explain the Fermi paradox is quite poor. I don't mean that it is pessimistic, but rather lame. According to this theory, if someone in space with more technology than us discovers us, we are more or less doomed. But I don't think that's true, since a civilization capable of mastering dimensions (as demonstrated in the third book) should also be able to see and detect us, and yet we're still here. They would only attack if they felt threatened by us, but we are completely harmless to space. The San-ti are right: we are bugs. So what is the stress of killing whatever you see in a dark forest if you are more powerful. That is justifiable for unintelligent predators. It is as if an Orca sailed in the dark sea, and upon seeing a small fish, killed it out of fear, not hunger. The Orca is above such an instinctive survival decision. Besides, the universe is not a dark forest for civilizations that have been able to develop some technology. Even we have ways of seeing the cosmos. Anyway, this theory, and the way they apply it in the book to make a pact with the San-ti (I repeat, a pact when the San-ti have the sophon, which is practically God) is quite absurd. It is to think that the universe is reduced to a jungle full of snakes whose only objective is to survive and not to be killed. It is extremely simplistic.END OF SPOILERS FROM BOOK TWO!!!!!6.- The whole plot of bringing a human brain to space and giving it to the San-ti (this is from the third book) doesn't make any sense either. What can humanity win by doing this? Besides, the San-ti have been studying us for decades with the sophon. I insist, the sophon slays any plot that may come after it, turning them into far-fetched and far-fetched decisions and scenes. Could they be mind-blowings? Uh, if they make any sense, yes. Otherwise, they're just imaginative scenes (science-based mostly) just to be contrived for the sake of being gimmicky."
2	I knew I was going to enjoy this from the start. I've never seen any of the other versions so can't compare it. The 1960s 'film noir' way in which it was filmed gives it such a sinister feel, which wouldn't be the same had it been filmed in colour. Andrew Scott is new to me, but is a perfect fit for the character he plays. I'm only at the first episode so hope it lives up to its early promise. I would imagine a lot of the exterior scenery that show up on here, and the interior of some of the grand buildings featured hasn't changed much since the era in which this series is supposedly set. 10 out of 10 for sure.
0	I honestly don't think the show should've continued after season 10, when Christina Yang leaves. I hadn't watched the last two seasons until I was bored at home because of quarantine and had nothing better to do. It was terrible, I don't know why they keep insisting on making more episodes, it's just recycled story lines at this point. I wish the producers would do the kind thing and put it out of its misery while it still has a shred of dignity left.
1	3 years ago, I would've told anyone this was the best show ever made. It was, no doubt about it. The first 5 seasons are absolutely brilliant. Stunning visuals, an absolutely fantastic cast and thanks to the books, the best dialogue and writing ever to grace television. Season 6 was still amazing, however that's where it took a turn..Season 7 is where it started to drop. Characters were acting.. out of character more and more, people could seemingly teleport all over the world and the once cunning dialogue seemed to have faded quite a bit. Then came a 2 year gap with the 8th and final season, which, I feel, made a lot of people forget about the slight disappoinment that season 7 was. Huge hype and anticipation was utterly crushed by probably the worst ending I have ever seen. The quality did not just continue to go downwards, it plummeted and crashed into the ground.It's still visually stunning, the music is still breathtaking and the production quality overall is just mindblowing - except when it comes to writing. 7 seasons if storyline were butchered, including the main villain and basically all of the main characters. It wasn't a factor of me not agreeing or me not being 'happy' about it - they literally destroyed their storlyines and made them act like different people whilst all they, and therefore we had gone through, meant nothing. It's been extremely painful to see such decline in what was genuinely the best thing to grace television. I truly believe that.I'll still give it a 7. The first few seasons are without a doubt the best you'll ever see. But if you missed out or come across this in 10 years time when the next generation will find out about this phenomenon: know that the ending and the whole last season are an utter disappointment an ruin it all.
1	First off, I would watch Nathan Fillion tie his shoes for an hour. He's the reason I still watch the show... well, I've grown to love Chen and Bradford, too... but the amount of medical snafus in this show are getting ridiculous. They need to get someone with a medical background to consult for the show. Sheesh... this last episode, Tim Bradford has back surgery after a dislodged bullet fragment makes him paralyzed and is back at work the following week? Someone in a car accident doesn't immediately get put into a c- collar? And why is Jenna Dewan at EVERY medical scene?? She's the worst EMT ever! Isn't Los Angeles bigger than that? Anyway, the acting is good... just fix the medical inaccuracies. Its.
1	I know this sounds crazy, but the past few seasons have looked cheap and feel impersonal. It feels more like a daytime soap then an award winning drama. If this show can't make us feel anymore like it did in seasons 8 and before, then it might be time to come to a close in the next season. Don't drag out a show that can't regain its spark.
1	So i loved the show, the intencity of scenes and the dialogue was not hard to follow with subtitles. But I just cant rate this any higher, I do love unusual endings in shows and movies, endings that you expect the least but it felt speedrun and skipped. I Awaited an big battle with army vs army to conclude the fight between the clans and that blackthorne would have some part to ensure victoyr for lord toranaga but instead lord toranaga just reveald his plans in the near end of his show and we just have to sit there and imagine he wins the battle. It would have been fun to atleast see a smal part of the battle and atleast get a glimpse of vicory on lord toranaga's side but instead we see the armies in a future timejump as lord toranaga explains his plans and then it cuts back to the present. I know this is how the book end (i have not read it) but atleast a part of the battle could have been fun to see. But for the show overall I can comfortly rate it a 9/10 as i do like these kind of shows (slow drama) because of how intense some scenes can be as it leads up to something big and you can feel it coming slowly witch builds up an satisfying intensity. Great actors great visuals and good to watch if you like history and japan culture :D.
0	Can't beleive how many people got into this show , watched the first 3 seasons and the i was dying from boardness , it has such a slow pace where each episode made me fall asleep !
2	I have to admit that I might be a bit biased as I love Andrew Scott, but I think he really delivered. His character was complex, and while the show was slow paced, he really held attention without overdoing it. The casting in general was great, although I have to say that I felt that Freddie felt a little out of place, she looked to modern to be believable for the time period imo.Purple Noon, The Talented mr Ripley and Ripley all have different interpretations of the story. Personally I loved this slow, dark, mature black and white interpretation. The slow pace somehow made it feel more believable, as if it was happening in real time.This Ripley is older and has a history of scheming, you can tell that everyone he meets from the starts feels that something is off about him, but he does gain their trust. There is an obvious darkness about him. The black and white really portrais his dark personality well. Dickie is rich, kind and naive, living a slow paced life .If you go in expecting a different interpretation then you will absolutely love it. Just enjoy the story and the visuals.
1	As GoT started, the first four seasons were insanely great. The story, the characters, the mature plot points. Everything was just perfect. It was 11/10 for me then. But as the seasons passed and episodes increased, the show became dumber and dumber and dumber. The story became childish, and the premise deteriorated. And now in season 8, it feels like a bunch of kindergarten kids are given the task of writing the plot for this show.
1	Lately this show has been poorly done...lost its place Now it's all who sleeps with who
1	The initial nine seasons of the show were enjoyable, but upon further reflection, it became apparent that the portrayal of doctors and hospital practices was not an accurate representation of reality. The show's approach seemed to be more focused on mocking patients and bedside manners, which can be perceived as distasteful and disrespectful, especially for healthcare professionals who have worked in environments with high ethical and moral standards.Despite these concerns, it is worth noting that the acting skills of the cast, particularly Dr. Derek and Christina, were commendable and well-suited for their respective roles.
2	"This was just.... such a pleasant surprise. I was super skeptical when I heard it was being made given the track record on adaptations made from games. But dang if they didn't absolutely nail this. It honestly feels like once the green light was given those in charge basically said, ""We got the IP to do it...now make it damn good."" The casting, the writing, the acting is so damn well done there is a surprise in every episode. The world building is second to none and keeps you engaged through-out the eight episodes. Heck I've one episode left and I ALMOST don't want to watch it because I know it's going to an age before season 2. Just outstanding."
0	"This is so Holywood...Watched 2 episodes, and will not be watching more. I am wondering why people thought of this show being authentically Japanese. On my mind, Tokyo Vice is so much more better in this respect. I did not read the book, I did not watch the 70th series, but this one is definitely not a piece of art. Despite all the costumes and excellent Japanese actors, whom I very much admire, this show feels superficial, with much cliche from Holywood-like acting and story-telling. I am a fan of Japan culture, but this ""creation"" has nothing to do with it, despite what authors/makers/some watchers may claim. Real sorry for the wasted effort, time and money."
2	The anticipation for this show has been crazy, and so far is staying very close to the original story what's sad thing about it is the subtitles are moving so fast you don't have time to read it all which is very disappointing. At this day and time the Japanese language should be represented but slow it down some, we all are not fast readers. The patent tree is absolutely excellent and you're learning the true culture of the Japanese people in the 16th century which we may see as harsh but what culture isn't harsh. We all don't live in a better roses. I can't wait to see how this is going to end.
2	I hear they may be looking to cancel this show, although I was not a fan in the beginning, I can get past most of the procedural issues. It is really turning into a nice light hearted hour of action and laughs. Hope it comes back
0	I cant belive it!!!Shame on you D&D and shame HBO for alowing this to happen!!!!I cant belive i have waited so long to see THIS????Are you kidding me????The worst season i have EVER seen!!!I hated so much the ending i cant rate it any better than this.Sorry y'all and sorry for all of us devoted fans that had to see this happening
0	The first two seasons were fantastic and really enjoyable. However season three is abysmal, every pc and woke agenda is forced down our throats, race baiting of the highest order where rules only apply to certain people and ignored in other cases. This program is finished for me
1	Its good scify as most movies are average this one has a great cast and the pace is faster than the Chinese version. All the episodes were interesting full of concepts involving nanotechnology, A. I., computers Some parts drag it down like the love story. The best parts involve a look at the drama of the people's revolution and how repressive tyranny is and there is no masking the idiodecy of the perpetrators. Any form of fascism, religious delirium as a projection of God onto the aliens which is absurd. The premise that we are not perfect enough to pass the stringent values of another species is truely explored as we can be stomped out like bugs.
1	These second rate writers took a 3 episode storyline and stretched it to almost 2 seasons. This storyline was shallow, repittitive and trite. I am watching one more episode and if I hear the word Elisha, this program will be dead to me.The nightmare was compounded by forcing us to watch a crossover to the FBI Rookie which is nothing more than a daytime soap opera. There is no solid storyline, character development is based on emotional tripe and the main actress Simone acts more like a high school counselor than an FBI agent.The writers for both shows should be fired and banned from any productions in the future.
1	Gets off to a slow start, season 1 and 2 are sort of build ups. But the writing is top notch and the character arcs are amazing with a lot of potential to develop. From season 3 it starts to become gripping with stuff happening, nail gripping scenes hoping your favourite character stays alive.Season 7 is decent, but trash with many plot holes and things that make no sense.Season 8 is trash tier, literally garbage that ruins the whole series as a whole. Hopefully the books get finished and tell a different story.
0	I don't watch TV for political agendas. I watch it to be entertained. Season 3 is not entertaining. It's CNN. Enjoy if that's what you want. I will find a new show to watch.
1	"There are aspects of the ""3 Body Problem"" story that potentially make it quite bad. But I haven't decided if these aspects of the story are used to convey a deep theme about humanity's failings. For example, the solution Thomas Wade comes up with to get the hard drive storing recordings of conversations with the aliens. That is the dumbest solution ever: slice the ship up killing everyone on board! Could they not just wait for them to resupply at a port and then get a search warrant. But maybe ""3 Body Problem"" is brilliant, and this is an illustration of how humans can justify killing people. Also, in this day in age, alien invasion stories don't make sense. We now know there are millions of planets like Earth. There is no reason to invade an occupied planet. But, again, this could just be used to contrast humanity with a much more advanced species so to illustrate our failings. Finally, the mission to intercept the aliens on their path to Earth is just so dumb. What do they expect to accomplish by sending a frozen brain to them? It feels almost like a live version of ""Rick and Morty"". So, I don't know. Is ""3 Body Problem"" brilliant or stupid. I will continue to watch season 2 to find out."
2	Every now and again there comes along a show or movie that is so raw and heartbreaking it stops you in your tracks, baby reindeer is the first show in a very long time to do this too me. As you've probably heard now it's based on the main characters true life and no it is not just about a stalker. Although the show does an excellent job of creating the fear & dread that we associate with stalking there is also an underlying deeper sadness (you'll understand about half way through the series). Do I recommend watching the show? Absolutely if you can handle very dark subject matter. *ps, there should also be a trigger warning on episode 3, I know there is on 4 but warning for episode 3 especially for trans folk and the queer community.I loved the show but it's one I will add to the never watch again.
0	"This was a slow starter. It wasn't until episode that I realised that, far from being serious science fiction, 3 Body Problem is a gloriously bonkers comedy.It wasn't easy to work out for a start as there was a pretty decent sci-fi storyline emerging in the early episodes. Unfortunately it turned out that the scenes set 60s/70s China were only provided the background for the confused main plot line.There's these scientists or something. Some of them put on VR headsets and play a fancy game made by some people on a boat because of aliens and stuff. There's also a guy who made his fortune selling snacks and his school teacher mate... it was so rushed it was hard to tell. Oh, and a boat gets chopped in half with some carbon nanotubes. Then the sky goes weird and everyone decamps to a stately home to make a nuclear bomb spaceship. Huh?The script is clunky and often laugh-out-loud bad. The only character of any interest is Liam Cunningham's Wade - perhaps the most bonkers and fun character in the whole thing. Wade is the boss of a secretive anti-alien agency which is in the unfortunate situation of having to save humanity on what looks like a budget of a couple of hundred quid. The ""agency"" starts off as just Wade and his gumshoe detective sidekick Da Shi, before rapidly expanding by hiring a Navy captain and some glum looking scientists. When the agency relocate from what looks like a 1970s office block to a stately home, the new found power and an expanded budget go to his head and Wade starts issuing increasing bizarre orders, like: build me a spaceship that can go as fast as light, wake me up from cryo-freeze so I can watch the tennis, blast a teacher's brain into orbit with nuclear bombs. He also spends quite a long time shouting at invisible alien computers (the ""siphone"", the ""cellphone""?).Maybe the book is brilliant. If so, I imagine it was more epic science fiction than batshit comedy romp. And that's the problem. Epic sci-fi is pretty... epic. Stories are often long and complex and it takes real skill to convert them into coherent, well paced scripts which are able to carry an audience without decending into absurd nonsense. It all felt a bit rushed and, ultimately, comically absurd."
0	"I've read the novel, watched the Chinese series. One of the best sci-fi story ever written for sure. Netflix didn't miss the chance to use this as a platform for propaganda... diversity, inclusivity etc. Whatever politically is needed. Even a Kurdish hero was added to the plot to save the earth. You gotta be kidding! You guys well ruined one of the best tought and written sci-fi story ever. Congrats!Mediocre acting and also mediocre visuals. The dialog recordings were so unbalanced that I had to turn the volume up and down. Main theme is like a rip off of West World theme. So even that's cheap.Well... I had the feeling that the producers didn't have their hearts in this project. Probably this was just another ""thing"" they do. They didn't care for the novel that's for sure.Go read the book."
2	This really is a great show that keeps you coming back for more. Sure there are few episodes in between each season that are a little slower, and then boom!!!! The show hits you with a great episode.
1	What strikes me hard in the novel is how complex YE Wenjie is with her self-contradiction, on one hand she's lost hope in humanity because she was betrayed and she went through the manic time in China but on another, she still believed in love and tried to save humanity (with the help of San-Ti, she thought San-Ti had higher moral standards).Quite ridiculous of this show to fast forward the story of young YE Wenjie, her falling love with her husband (the guy who stole her idea of using the sun as a signal amplifier in the show while who actually helped and protected her a ton in the novel and made her feel a little warmth in human) and her being a mom with help from local villagers and her being a teacher to local village kids (again made her regret her decision of sending message out to Saniya-Ti because she felt love among humans), all the stories that make her a round person with complexity and struggles that audience can empathize with instead of just a simple villain as depicted in the show. And even more ridiculous that the show spends lots of time around meaningless romantic tangles among the friend group, which doesn't help in either storyline progressing or showing the complexity of human nature. This is not a sitcom or romcom like Friends or How I Met Your Mother, it doesn't really matter who Saul is sleeping with or whether Jin loves Will.Another thing that fascinated me in the novel is how it reveals the three-sun chaotic environment of San-Ti planet by showing the history of how human understand the universe and physics (a lot of real historical figures like ancient Chinese & European philosophers and physicists) and proves that the physic theories on earth can't be applied to San-Ti and can't help San-Ti solve their problem, therefore the only option for them is to find another habitat, earth! But again this part is fast forward in the show.It seems that the show doesn't have the patience to show the complexity of human nature and the detailed physic science as written in the book, it just wants to fill all the eye-catching special effects into a sci-fi story plus some boring romance and love stories.
0	"This didn't work for me unfortunately. I tried to hang in for a few episodes but it had a very uneven tone. Many of the characters while amazing for other things, just didn't work right here.Perhaps the biggest disappointment was Eiza Gonzalez, who I am a fan of.I kind of knew this could be pants thanks to seeing John Bradley as one of the cast. He was in something else that bombed big style. He is rapidly becoming a ""Jonah"" figure.I don't know if something has been lost in translation from the original Chinese to this, if it has been, then it is most likely Benioff and Weiss that are to blame on that front. That or this should have just stayed Chinese.I also felt like this was almost and advertisement to encourage people to smoke again. It cropped up so rampantly everywhere.Normally I'm onboard for something new like this, but this just didn't hit the right note for me at all. It was flat in too many places and I didn't gel with any of the key characters."
0	Part of Tom Ridley's engaging charm is his earnest boyishness and his eagerness to please. So why cast a nearly 50-year-old man in the role? Andrew Scott is a respected actor, but this part is all wrong for him. I've enjoyed both the Matt Damon and Alain Delon versions, where Tom's youthful beauty opens doors ~ or at least leaves them ajar. And the black-and-white photography doesn't work here. Dickie Greenleaf's life was one of technicolor luxury; let us see it in all of its Mediterranean opulence. So very disappointed by the creative decisions that mar this newest version of Patricia Hightower's thriller.
2	Baby Reindeer is a raw and gripping watch, with astonishingly nuanced writing and stellar acting to boot.A difficult watch at times, it's confronting and cautionary, with a focus more on the commonalities between the stalker and stalked in terms of the drive for attention and validation, and the relentless need to hang on to what they value, with the victim internalizing the blame and guilt for both his abuse and the longevity of the stalking.It was great to see a male victims take on abuse and stalking, as he often played down the severity of either, and seemed reluctant to consider himself a victim at all, and his relationship with Teri was compassionately and sensitively portrayed.To think that this was based on a true story is a bit mind bending, and I wonder how much of what happens is embellished for the script, but regardless of this, the story is well written and executed, and the post-production is brilliant.
2	Grey's Anatomy is a drama series made by Shonda Rhimes staring Ellen Pompeo, Patrick Dempsey etc. Centered around five surgical interns and goes through their professional and personal challenges along with fellow surgeons at Seattle Grace Hospital.As a drama lover when I first heard about this show I immediately decided to watch it and frankly the first 10 to 12 seasons were sensational and entertaining for instance the plot and the story line were so engrossing and inspiring and it even got me on the edge of my seat in some scenes. Last two episodes of each and every season was always unexpectedly nail-biting and spine-tingling. Also, the sound effects and the cast were pretty much memorable.But unfortunately, after season 12 when almost most of the original cast had left the show, it gradually turned in to an unconvincing mediocre series that I couldn't even stand watching another episode and it was definitely the time for them to end the show but surprisingly they've continued and now it's in its season 19 with the most formulaic boring stories.If you want to start watching Greys Anatomy, do it for sure but for the sake of your time and energy stop after season 12.
1	HBO, you actually did it! You have ruined the show. All together, seoson 8 was not worth watching, but the real cherry on the cake was the finale...
0	This show had so much promise but really fell flat. They failed to develop or show any type of character arc. Who is the main character? Is it Jin, Auggie, Saul? They bounce all around between them but don't really give any of them any personality. Why you ask? Because they took 1 character from the book and turned them into 5 people trying to play off all these uninteresting and ultimately non impactful to the story interactions between them.It never really felt like there was any climax in the season. They also failed to give any development to the opposing side so you can understand their reasons for actions.
1	"This series CGI is definitely a stunner. But the series as a whole could have been easier to like with actually sympathetic lead characters in the mix. If you watch episode 5, you will have watched perhaps the only full episode worth the hype this show is getting btw. (Although I also liked the sub-titled historical intro (set in China, circa 1977), that featured an excellent actress who portrays the tortured young Dr. Ye. Meanwhile in contrast to this poignant and serious portrayal of an enslaved physicist who betrays humanity, are the two irritating ""western"" female scientists, Jin and Auggie, who seem to have been cast for their ability to maintain sex appeal even while grimacing or in a state of shock. (Question: Does how good female physicists look in tight jeans impress particle accelerators?) And one other question: how does Dr. Salazar, who is nearly going blind/ being driven insane by flashing numbers scrawled across her vision, manage to apply mascara and eyeliner so perfectly? I got used to this distracting supermodel Einstein schtick after a while, but sheesh, It's just so ludicrous. Btw, I've now watched half of the ""unflashy"" Chinese 30 episode version called ""3 body"" and it's dramatically superior. At least it never reeks of glammed-up sci-fi soap opera like this Neflix version does. Although admiitedly, the final scene was pretty OK."
1	"I've only played Fallout 4, so I am not a fanboy of the game from the first release like so many people are. Still, the series did not disappoint. The first thing I thought when I saw this was the Art Director deserves an Emmy. The place looks exactly like the video game. The cities, the towns, the abandoned buildings are right out of the video game. The Art Director did a masterful job in creating a wasteland of destroyed cities.Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins were terrific. The reason I didn't give the series an 8 or 9 star review is because of one character, Maximus/Titus. I didn't like his storyline, and I especially didn't like the actor, I thought he was terrible. He always has this forlorn, sad look on his face, and he always whined. I just didn't like him at all especially the attempts at humor. Goggins on the other hand was terrific as usual.For those who don't know about the game, we are in a ""Mad Max"" type environment after a nuclear war has almost completely destroyed civilization. We have people living in underground vaults hoping to repopulate the Earth one day after whatever is left on the surface has died. But the surface dwellers aren't too keen on dying out just yet. We have various factions of all the different groups and of course radioactive monsters. The story is done bascially in two different perspectives. We experience the present while remembering the past and how the world got where it is today. It tells how and why the vaults were built and how we came to war. Accompanying our protaganists is a sound track made up of mostly 1940s and 1950s songs. It's fine for a while but they overdo it a bit.All in all, I think this was a very good series and I can envision at least 3 more seasons. I highly recommend this series."
1	It's not bad if you turn your brain off and just have it on in the background. The most annoying thing is no one could hit what they were aiming at if their life depended on it... which within the story it often is. My 8 year old can hit a target at a greater range while under intense nerf gun fire 😂 but seriously if real cops found themselves needing to fire their weapon as often as this lot with such poor accuracy they would all be dead.There is also a lot of pausing and hesitation to let people get away so the episode isn't over in two minutes.Having said all that it is quite addictive and easy binge watching.
0	Managed to screw in 2 seasons all the series. From best ever to meh. Gj to the writers. It was difficult, but they did it
1	"Yes I read the books, no I don't care that they changed things. It's simply not a good show.This was created by David Benioff and DB Weiss, the two who created 4 of the greatest seasons of television and 2 of the worst (Game of Thrones). I didn't know they were in charge until a few episodes in and it really made sense once I found out. In an interview about SE6 of GoT Weiss said that he fought tooth and nail to add a pointless zombie bear scene saying ""Damn it, I want a god-damn zombie bear!"" He'd fought for several seasons until he was finally greenlit to add it. Why? Because he thought it was cool. No other reason.It very much shows that the two couldn't help themselves yet again when creating this show. The books have plenty of concrete and fascinating imagery that, to the shows credit, translate very well to the screen. However, so much of the added material is just bad and weighs down the fascinating ideas in the books.Very very minor spoilers, it's not enough that in one scene everything starts to get destroyed, but then a little girl riding a literal flaming horse bursts through a window with CGI lava pouring in behind her screaming ""save meee aaahhhh"" which genuinely made me laugh at how bad it was. It's so over the top. Of course that's the scene where my wife walks in and just laughs asking me what the hell I'm watching and it's legitimately embarrassing seeing the absolutely cringe on display.Not everything is the show's fault, like the katana lady who was edgy and cringe even in the books, and some of the show works like the stunning visuals, but I guess the show's worst enemies were the ones who tried to make this in the first place. You need a mature team to make this series work and we got two hacks most famous for drilling a celebrated series into the dirt. Who could have seen this coming...It's simply messy, adding aspects to the story to make it more interesting and cool when the (first two) books are already just that. You can change things, I don't mind, but just keep them consistent within the world you're displaying."
1	"Let's play a drinking game! Take 1 shot every time a character brags about how they ""save lives"". Take 2 shots every time a character is referred to a (insert specialty here) ""GOD"". Take 3 shots every time someone worships the ground Mer walks on and the air she breathes. Or maybe don't do that. You'll probably have alcohol poisoning 20 mins into any episode after season about 10. This show used to be pretty good. Now it's basically just ""The Cult of Meredith Grey"""
1	Have been a big fan of the show since series 1 and now at series 13, I've actually lost interest. The first 10 series were hard to not binge watch - although this is a medical drama it's the characters that made me continue to watch more. However, the characters have now lost their depth and the story lines are becoming dull and strung out. Since the death of one of the main characters in series 11 it feels as though Shonda should have left us all to wonder what happened in the wake of it, not actually tried to show us. I won't be tuning in to series 14.
0	What, he is still a rookie! Nobody has been employed in the force since he started over 3yrs ago????. !!He must be the oldest rookie cop ever! How embarrassing....you'd have thought by now he wouldve asked for a transfer!! Must be a crap division if they cant hire people.
1	"Let's start with the fact that those who were expecting a dark, melancholic drama with complex philosophical explorations in the spirit of ""The Book of Eli"" (2010) or the opposite, full of killer action in the form of ""Doomsday"" (2008), will be disappointed. Fans of art house and ""Six-String Samurai"" (1998) are also unlikely will like the adaptation. Amazon's Fallout, although it has a little bit of everything in it, ultimately remains a predominantly evil satire with elements of fan service, taking the ideological and conceptual basis of the controversial fourth part of the game series.The shelters are safe, but the wasteland is lifeless only at first glance. Monsters come not only in the form of cockroaches, water creatures, but also people. Consumerism of the fifties played a cruel joke on its ideological inspirers. The authors quickly go over the top, paying a lot of attention to small details, references and key elements, some of which, however, will only be understandable to hardcore fans of the genre. A scene later they joke about the fact that the ""Brotherhood of Steel"" uses old technologies to collect technologies, while simultaneously sarcastically noting that there is no practical use for a toaster found in a scorched desert. They immediately switch to the next segment, without really plunging into the context. This approach is reflected in its own way on the main characters:A shelter resident raised on high ideals is forced by circumstances to go to the surface and face harsh reality.A boy who miraculously survived, tormented by moral dilemmas, builds his career in the ""Brotherhood of Steel"".Ghoul cowboy. An ambiguous character with a partially vague past, whose image and behavior, adjusted for local realities, are almost completely copied from the ""Man in Black"" from ""Westworld"" (2016-2022).At first all three will be united by the search for a certain object that can change the fate of the entire surrounding surviving world. Along the way, the main story arc, as usual in an ""RPG with Action elements"", is diluted with several side stories of varying degrees of interest.During flashbacks, when one of the characters indulges in rhetorical reasoning, a third kind character interrupts him with an apt thought - they are all just a product for later consumption, so it's time to forget about art and any meaningful depth in a world ruled by corporations and a joyful consumer culture. What serves as a small plot digression is equally applicable as a verdict on the first season. The film adaptation is not bad in its own way, but at the same time, it's required to understand its specifics and what lies at its core, so as not to expect from it what it is not."
0	I started this series with such high hopes, being a huge fan of The talented Mr Ripley. However it turned out to be a MAJOR disappointment.The characters lack so much charisma, the dialogue was so bland and boring, and why was it filmed in black and white? IN ITALY??In the movie Tom has so much wit and intelligence, planning and coniving every step, whereas here Tom is just messy and clumsy. The elevator scene with him dragging Feddy's body and leaving a trail of blood, only noticing it after coming back, what was that?? Matt Damon would never!!A great movie ruined by this series, a series of unfortunate events.
2	It was a master piece. It was written to the perfection. It was mesmerizing. It was gripping. It was so shocking that if someone is binge watching this show he/she will need a time-off in between to get their head around things and accept some messed up, yet mind blowing development.But yet, I cant hate it enough after final season. Its like you came to know that you were in love with the wrong one all along. It was like looking at a completely different person. It was like seeing your own dreams and expectations get destroyed. It was not a let down, it was a BETRAYAL!
2	Filmed in black and white, mostly in Italy, Ripley is a brilliant psychological thriller.The story is purported to take place in 1961 but it feels like a 1930s film noir. Mysterious lead character, beautiful and suspicious antagonist (portrayed by Dakota Fanning), thoroughly believable victim, Dickie Greeleaf, and eerie settings, it draws you in, compelling you to watch the next episode, and the next.The creator, writer and director is connected to The Silence of the Lambs, Moneyball and other hit movies, but nowhere does his talent shine through like it does here.Once you start watching, I think you'll be drawn in too.
0	I followed Nathan Fillion over from Castle and I really enjoyed the first season of The Rookie. I even looked forward to watching the show every Sunday evening.By season two the blush was beginning to fade from the proverbial rose. But it was still watchable and even enjoyable on occasion. But it wasn't season one by a longshot!Then came season three and I was starting to wonder, is it me or is it the show? Well, after tonight -- well into Season 4 -- I know it's the show. It just plain sucks! After about 20 minutes I turned the channel, opting instead to watch The Weakest Link on another network.The Rookie sucks and I won't be going back. Period. End of story.
1	Really liked seassons 1-7 , that final seasson 8 in my case two thumbs down
1	5 stars for the excellent production values and performances. 0 stars for writers. Ruined the story by, again, adding 21st century ideas into a past civilization. The beauty that could have been. Was so excited and now so disappointed.I'm most sorry for the women whose roles could have been so much better. Instead of showing their brilliance and cunning in a proper historical context the writers decided to put a much more modern spin on the characters. This robbed the characters of their true power and ability.This also deeply impacted the male characters. Torranaga is a shadow of who he was in the book. Blackthorne as well.
2	Translating the series to screen was a difficult task, but the show is faithful to the events of the books while making appropriate modifications to fit the medium.The primary protagonists are now contemporaries and friends in an interwoven plot line. We see great progress in telling the stories of Ye Wenjie, the Three-Body game, the staircase project, and the introduction of wallfacers and hibernation.Many other modifications are very sensible - Ye's principles of cosmic sociology have been replaced with metaphor. The game narrator / sophons are personified. The legacy of the ETO is embodied by original character Tatiana, enabling behavior motivations distinct from Ye and Evans.Alas, the best remains ahead, as the series proceeds into the terrors of The Dark Forest, and the bizarre reaches imagined in Death's End. We can only hope Netflix continues their investment for one more season to ensure we get to see it.
0	Too much bad acting. Way to much music in almost every scene. A messy plot. Not enough action. Monsters that are not nearly as dangerous as in the games, and are killed easily. For instance a gulper that is simply killed by dragging a man out of its mouth. I didn't really understand how that was possible at all to kill a big scary monster like that. The main characters do a decent job trying to make the series interesting, but many of the other characters are simply bad actors. A lot of scenes are confusing and a lot of questions about why the characters do what they do or say what they say are left unanswered. The good thing about the whole thing is the visuals and the environment, that is very true to the game series. But that's about it. Maybe I expected too much. But it felt like a less than mediocre Nuka cola.
0	Combined with bad acting skills of the main actor!
2	Got a chance to see this randomly and omg did not regret even for a minute. What a beautiful, heartwrenching show with such an important message in the end. The actor, writer, director Richard Gadd has outdone himself in this one and the story being a real story of his own life, brings another spark in the show. All the performances were extremely brilliant and the cinematography will take your heart away. Somehow, you will understand what goes through the head of a person who went through trauma and here is where the writer and actor wins. It is a must watch. The ending will leave you in splits, but will make you think, and maybe that is what the writer wanted to do after all. Recommended.
1	After season 10 I stopped watching the show. I think they lost how to end the show so the episodes became pointless. My opinion
0	I've played some video games in my life, Fallout not being one of them. I understand how fans of the game are happy to see it as a series. They keep saying how much it looks like the game and how it's artistically accurate. But is that it? Shouldn't things happen clearly when you turn a game into a series or movie. A reviewer said it's more fun to watch someone play the game than watch this. I completely agree. I watched the first episode and didn't feel like watching the second. I started the second episode and waited, bored until 2 thirds into it before something happened. We don't get time to know the main characters and they just wander around saying lame dialogs. One cannot even compare this to the Last of Us series which has humor, action and characters you care about and really good script. Fallout tried to include cameos by familiar faces to make up for how lame this show is but even Walton Goggin or Michael Rapaport can't save this. Watch Walton Goggin in Justified where he's given a good script and be amazed. As for this Fallout... i mean Strikeout I'm done with it. Can't wait for the second season of The last of us.
0	"The show was everything I hoped it wouldn't be. The tone is too light, the writing is predictable, the characters are bland, the world is too clean, etc.. I know a lot of passionate people put a lot into this, but it just feels like the only Fallout they played was 4. I really wish I could like this show, but honestly can't recommend it with its ""by the numbers"" writing style and tone deaf approach to a beloved series.I really was hoping they'd capture what made 1, 2, 3, and New Vegas great. The soul crushing wasteland and atmosphere is not there. It's a comedy with some light drama thrown in at the end of the day."
2	I never got bored while watching episodes of the series. The characters are very well written. It was also a series that introduced me to Japan. It was very interesting that they did not attach importance to life and had a different perspective on the world. It was very enjoyable to watch Anjin's cultural clashes and the games of Toranaga Sama. I wish there was a second season. Mariko and Anjin's relationship was one of the things I liked about the series. But I couldn't help but feel sorry for Mariko's husband. Overall, it was a series that I liked very much and I recommend everyone to watch it.
1	"For once more, the fabulous D & D duet take certain liberties in their adaption of a renowned literary accomplishment, and if you take in account how things ended with Game of Thrones, then you shouldn't be overtly optimistic for the outcome of this one.I wasn't a big fan of the first two books -my mind changed with the third which I'm currently reading. I'm not sure if it was the translation or the writing style, I struggled to finish the first-the second was slightly better. I'm not a big fan of hard science. I always felt that Arthur Clarke did the same thing in a better manner in Childhood's End.The Netflix show polishes the rough edges and simplifies the whole thing, adding lots of gory scenes to make the show appeal to a younger and less sophisticated audience. Not necessarily a bad thing if you want to target the average viewer rather than the hardcore science fiction fans of the original trilogy.The Netflix show feels very rushed, by the time you reach episode six you're already in the third book, but hey, these are the guys who adapted Game of Thrones, so no suprise there.There is lots of visual excitement, but lots of scenes, such as the destruction of the ship and its passenger, feel like they belong to another film. The characters are also kinda lame. The ""Oxford 5"" were a bad idea better suited for the Final Destination franchise.After I finished the Netflix show, I started watching the Chinese version and I couldn't believe my eyes. Science fiction done on a level that has never been done before, with an amazing visual style much better than any Netflix or HBO show. All you intelligent viewers out there do yourselves a favor and watch it. Then you can decide which is the better adaption."
0	Why? This is so pointlessly depressing and even painful.The annoying protagonist is stalked by an obviously unbalanced woman. He just rides along with it. A lot of pointless babbling like the moronic guy is achieving self awareness.We then suffer his painfully unfunny comedic acts.He then ends up with a man who gets him high to the point of passing out so he could molest him.If this is biographical, the man is as clueless as he is boring. There was no point to this show. He should have kept it to himself. It isn't entertaining nor is it insightful.I can't believe this was financed and produced.
1	Something is just off. For the readers of the original novel, you know how carefully Cixin Liu planted every detail, slowly guided you into that plot trap, and boom, a crazy idea with a magnificent scene showed up and blew you away. That is not something to be found here in this show, it's all because of the pacing, everything is raging forward, and the big ideas just flows out like the rest of the story, nothing special, nothing epic. I cannot speak for those who have never read the book before, but I doubt people can really catch the essence of those big ideas. It has nothing to do with casting, recreating or anything, I'm not criticizing those.And if you find the characters in the original book are flat enough, somehow David & Dan find a way to make characters in this show even more flat, more flat than those dehydrated Trisolarans. By the way they call them Santi now which is probably the only thing loyal to the original novel. That is the price of building 5 (or 4, or more than 5, who cares) protagonists at the same time in a show less than 9 hours. The good thing is the way they rearranged the story line did left plenty of space for the protagonists to grow in future seasons. Let's just hope the crew use this to their advantage in the next few seasons.Everything else is just a typical Netflix show, industry standard production, industry standard cinema, industry standard everything. For that it deserves a solid 7/10. It's a good show, and if you are not familiar with the original you might find some parts quite intriguing, first few episodes might be bit slow if you don't have any idea where the plot is heading but get better after ep3. It is what it is, it's a TV show detouring from the book and ,at least the first season, isn't your typical epic Sci-fi. It tries to please everyone but hardly satisfies anyone. Hope to see how things develop next season.
2	I didn't play the Fallout game (although I briefly played the mini game on my phone) and I'm so excited for this show! My husband and I binged the entire season this weekend and I'm so sad it ended. I do love anything in the post apocalyptic style / dystopian thrillers and this show is it! The acting is top notch, interesting/unique storyline, and the sets & costumes are great. I think this has the potential to be a HUGE hit. It makes me want to start Halo now. As a non video gamer, these shows plus Last of Us are hits even amongst the non gamer. I'm super looking forward to the next season...I could see so many ways the show could possibly go. I can't wait for more!!
0	Too childish & weird for me. No real storyline. Great acting. Great actors. Excellent production. But a meaningless story. Took 3 episodes to get a brief glimpse of where it's going. Nowhere. I won't be watching more.I've never been into computer games. This one is very annoying.Many other fantasy movies have strong storylines. This one doesn't.What starts out as intriguing with dying scientists and police investigating it soon turns into weird stuff with new age game headsets and fantasy scripts.I'm.guessing the script is AI generated as it's quite solid.sentences but nonsensical.. Lots of buzzwords but no depth or continuity.
2	Originally, I thought it was that detective show with Adrian Dunbar making a welcome return then realised that was Ridley!Despite not leaving my settee for 7 hours after a bingewatch of this, I am worn out from watching them walking up and down all those steps (it was a relief when they fixed the lift).I was apprehensive when I realised it wasn't in colour (I am sure the Italian tourist board is too!) but, let's just say, like the old Guinness adverts did; not everything in black and white makes sense!I have never seen the previous versions so can't compare them.I vaguely recognised Andrew Scott from a few British shows (plus 1917) and John Malkovich turns up to do a couple of cameo scenes. Knowing so few of the actors allowed me to concentrate on the storyline but there didn't seem to be much of one to be put off by (Skip episodes 3-6 and you won't miss much!).I loved the camera angles and Lucio stole the show with his stares (his paw marks on the stairs bring some brief colour to it all!).10 for directing and cinematography.8 for the acting 5 for the number of episodes you can skip.
0	Greys anatomy has always been extraordinarily medically inaccurate, however, it was entertaining and fun for the first 3-4 seasons. Past that it slowly became unbearable to watch.
0	Like many shows that Amazon has done in recent years, all our fears about how bad this show might be has come true. They made a show for people that have never played the game. It's not as bad as I was expecting which is why I gave it a higher rating however if you are a big fan of the franchise, you're likely to be as disappointed as we all thought we would be. Oxhorn explained it right in his review of the trailer. It's better than the abomination they created in the wheel of time but not quite as entertaining as the halo series which fans hated. If you've never played thw game then I'm sure you'll enjoy this show since it was made for the non fans yet again, for some weird reason.
2	Sure the black and white looks nice and chic and all. But there should be a universal law that says you have to show color when filming in Italy. Italy, in the 1960s, the Amalfi Coast, and you chose to not show colors? I am secretly waiting for the director to see that this was a huge mistake, and for him to re-release a version in color, and I can't wait to watch that. The characters behave somewhat strange sometimes. Dickie and Marge are so cold, distant, suspicious, yet at the same time overly welcoming when there's no need to. And Tom is just too creepy all the time than what anyone would deal with or take serious in real life. Why would Dicke askTom to stay with him if they show no signs of a developing friendship or that they even like each other? However, it's still the talented Mr. Ripley, nearly 8 hours of it. Bravo for making a remake, 9 stars for that. If they have shown Italy in color, it would have been 10 stars regardless of the weird parts, it's still highly enjoyable!
1	"...... I'll get to the ""but"" in a minute.Superbly cinematic and expertly filmed, Ripley gets the period, vibe, sets and props spot on. Ripley does not appear to have spared any expertise or expense in getting things right.The cast, with one glaring exception, is exceptional. The exception is Andrew Scott. I adore him in most everything else he has done, but he should have turned down - nay, run away from - this role. He is far too old to play Tom Ripley; in fact, he is more than twice the age of Ripley and no amount of makeup or tape can hide the actor's age. Pity, as Scott acts the role well, but his effort, indeed, the entire series, is spoiled due to the incredulity of a 47 year-old playing a ~25 year old."
1	For a start Andrew Scott is 48 years old and looks it, so the persona of the young drifter doesn't fit. Next, not just his deliberately slow dialogue but all the casts methodical serious approach to everything becomes a drag.Add to this this monochrome colouring and the series fails to deliver much punch, surprise or atmosphere apart from dreariness, Ripley is more of a depressed desperate loser than a crafty conman and opportunist.They've put effort and thought Into the production but they have over done the styling, it drowns out the intrigue and fun the story.So an average show, that could have been better.Dakota Fanning's character is so deadpan she flattens most scenes she is in, the beauty and sparkle of Naples is totally lost, the lightness and purity that Gwyneth Paltrow once gave this role, made the character far more appealing.So I'm being generous with a 5, it's mainly for effort, they tried hard but failed.
0	First two seasons where good third season not so much. We here all about race in the real world stop putting it in Hollywood.
0	We love Nathan Fillion and the cast of The Rookie. My husband and I do not watch much tv but this is one show we love and look forward to each week. I have never done this before but feel compelled to write. My husband is an ex-police officer and truly loves The Rookie. We're both Nathan Fillion fans from Firefly days but also love the other cast members and look forward to their story lines. Please keep the shows coming. PLEASE!!!!
2	This dark and powerful true story is a complicated thriller that ultimately examines male abuse victims through an angle rarely seen or spoken of. Painfully honest and brutally paced to throttle the viewer into the personal and multi layered world of the main character this incredibly well acted dramedy is complex, beautiful and one of the best and most important shows in recent years.Richard Gadd whose personal real life experiences is the backbone of this haunting story relives painful moments of his own ordeal as Donny with incredible honesty and bravery while taking full control over his own story. Jessica Gunning, as Martha, Donny's stalker, delivers a fiery and physical performance so unhinged and raw, the like of which has not been seen since Kathy Bates in Misery. Her ability to bring both red hot fury and dignity to a character with few redeeming qualities brings some much needed moments of dark humor to this otherwise serious story.Unabashed and ever present until the very end Jennifer Gunning's, Martha is the backbone of Reindeer Baby. Nava Mau, who plays Teri, Donny's beautiful and loving on again off again fling brings tremendous levity and much needed charisma to the show. And while Teri is trans (as is the actress who portrays her) and Teri's trans identity plays a central role and an ongoing theme in the story, Nava Mau fully transcends this part of the characters identity allowing us to get a deep dive into Teri's toxic attraction to Donny and his many red flags.The effects of toxic masculinity and homophobia and transphobia on men and how that particularly impacts male abuse victims has rarely been portrayed so masterfully and personally for wide audiences before. And judging by its global success Reindeer Baby's themes have never been more important than now.
1	Feel devastated after final episide, everything for nothing....
0	...a Nolan was responsible for this disjointed mess.The characters are unbelievable, unlikable, and uninteresting almost entirely due to the storytelling jumping around so much and leaving out enormous chunks of their lives. Why, with eight hours or so of time, afe so many characters so underdeveloped? Why is so much of the so-called Wasteland in relatively good upkeep after so many years exposed to the elements and no one to maintain any of it?Many sequences are painfully long, and do nothing to enhance the story. Many sequences are introduced and over so quickly one wonders why they even bothered.It's painful to watch.
1	"I now watched 4 complete seasons of Grey's anatomy. And don't get me wrong, I like most of it. I liked SCRUBS better, I liked HOUSE better, but this series is, regarding content and character development, definitely the other one in my top 3 of medical TV series, and overall still in the top 10 even if it is place 9 or 10. But during season 4 I began to feel uncomfortable with the character of Meredith Grey, played by Ellen Pompeo. Well, played .... in literally every scene be it funny, sad, reflective, miss Pompeo fails to bring any emotional content to the screen. Her face is that of a jaded stuck up arrogant b**** if it is not expressionless at all. No matter what facial expression you might expect from an actor in any given circumstance and no matter how hard her colleagues try to save a scene: with her in it staring at them like they are not there, Ellen Pompeo is ruining this series. If you tell me that she had some facial operation that went terribly wrong I would believe it. It becomes harder and harder to watch and is putting me off the series. I guess the producers had no choice to keep her on as lead ""actress"" since the series is a hit, but in my opinion that is in no way tied to the non-existing efforts of Ellen Pompeo."
2	A brilliant production. Andrew Scott is amazing, sweet and sinister all at once. Complex and shallow at the same time - you just never know....... The cinematography is astounding, breathtaking at points. Some scenes look like a piece of art. Italy is portrayed like another character in the series.I would have given this 10/10 but for the weird anachronistic Freddie character. I couldn't wait for him to be gone.Scott eats up the screen, I can't wait to see what's next for him. No one else gets a chance with Ripley, you think he's one thing, they think they've gotten the better of him because of their status/wealth. But he outsmarts them, on occasionally to their peril. And I'm glad of it.
0	Couldn't get further than one episode - the opening sequence in China was pretty good and drew me in but then we are introduced to our main characters- some of the cleverest scientists in the western world at the top of their profession and unfortunately they are just badly cast and have dialogue akin to university first years - seriously it's terrible dialogue and doesn't in any way make the characters believable.Diversity in your casting is great but the dialogue and characterisation in this production works against the diversity and makes no one seem like a real person at the top of the scientific community. Can't tell whether it's bad acting or bad direction maybe both but it's all just awful.
2	I'm a huge fan of the games. I played Fallout 1 & 2 in the 90s, and Fallout 3, New Vegas and 4 later on (New Vegas is my favorite, but I love them all, yes even 4). I only briefly played Tactics and never tried 76.Anyway, this show is actually way better than I expected! It absolutely nails the tone of the games. The production design is fantastic. Some of the actual filmmaking is a little mixed, with a few scenes struggling when it comes to basic blocking and framing, but overall this is top tier work with a great cast. Walton Goggins is a standout, this is one of his best roles. There's some really nice character writing, too, and actual character growth.I know there's been some controversy with the changes made to the lore, especially in the last episode, but I actually think they handled it well, making the revelations near the end a satisfying character moment with some real emotional stakes to it. This isn't a perfect show, of course, but there's wayyyy more to like than not like, and as a fan of the games, I'm genuinely surprised how well this turned out. The production values are decent, the character writing and casting is great, and the tone is spot on; that's all I can ever ask for from an adaptation (or continuation) of something I love.Would love to see games like BioShock, Mass Effect, Deus Ex, Dishonored and Half-Life get the same sort of treatment.
0	Incredible-beyond words in the epic scope--but wtf was with the lighting in episode 3 season 8? It was like 90 minutes of watching a black screen. If the trenches weren't alight, Dothraki swords ablaze, or dragon fire being spewed I literally couldn't tell wtf was going on. Do the editors only watch the final product on some super HD screen instead of a regular desktop/tv? This was the most frustrating and disappointing experience of something I have been looking forward to for ...nearly a decade. The series gets 9/10 this episode gets a 2.
1	I enjoyed this overall, liked the cast, the acting, visuals abit questionable sometimes (blob covering the earth) but generally pretty good. It's just the story I found it hard to take seriously, both the ai's strategy and the humans strategy make zero sense. Ai coming to attack us gave us a 400 year warning, told us all their plans and attempts to wipe out science otherwise we win? Why not just stop the ships?The humans strategy is even more insane. To send basically a living human brain with no body that gets propelled through space by 1,000 nuclear bombs that each have extreme room for failure as it all needs to be lined up like threading a needle? How is that a viable option? How are effectively 2 people on the planet coming up with this mental strategy, is there nobody else? We can propel a probe at 1% the speed of light, technically right now in real life, its called project starshot and it shoots lasers at a 1 gram craft propelling it to insane speeds. But the idea of riding a brain on the waves of 1000 nuclear bombs is the one that wins?Not only that, but the 2 people in charge of this absolute mess are about to time travel (cryo) to the future to make sure this insane plan works. That's the best earth could come up with? I'm ashamed and we deserve to be wiped out. Why not send probes travelling at 1% lightspeed as kinetic nukes at the fleet or basically anything other than the current plan.
2	I thought it'd be similar to 2015 The intern since the synopsis was similar. However, I was surprised by the sheer creativity and the acting prowess of the cast involved. It's craftily made and sometimes the realism baffles me. It's definitely one of the best TV series I've seen.
1	"This latest in a recent trend of videogame adaptations is lacking the edge and wit of the Fallout titles.Bethesda's famous IP could work on the small screen; but the ""how"" is something I feel is still, as of yet, unanswered. Porting a videogame to a TV show takes work because those are two very different mediums with different aims. Splitting the story between three characters isn't necessarily a bad idea (GoT did brilliantly on multiple subplots) but it can be hard to properly pull off. The sprightly Ella Purnell as the vault-dweller female protagonist Lucy MacLean has a face that fits the brand and a geniality and greenness to match, but is just missing something.The through-line and recycled ""brand"" is shaky, and I feel the show is unsure of its desired identity (at the moment). Original Fallout is hilariously unhinged, comical, with dark humour that simply flows between scenarios - across the different factions it challenges notions of conventional ethics and philosophies too, so there's always food for thought. But the challenge for the writers here is to find a story that can work cohesively on TV that feels like Fallout but takes it in the new direction of a plot-driven live action production.The dialogue in the games is outstanding and engaging, but here it's merely okay. Every word should entertain, develop, or expand. But I can't say that here it really does. We get a lot of camera panning into facial expressions and filler speech; but not enough meat and potatoes.The story lacks suitable structure. It feels too ""sandbox"" without enough linearity and purposeful direction. Where's the show going? What does the viewer have to look forward to? Where are the cliffhangers? On many occasions the show is absorbed in the scene of the moment and forgets about introducing the next chapter, the fluidity is missing. Where are the characters' driving motivations? Are the characters investable... or just expendable? The producers perhaps assume that the strength of the Fallout brand can compensate for mediocre writing. It doesn't."
1	Been watching this show pretty much since the beginning.. Well it has changed a lot. The first few seasons, i really loved, i mean you had all the OG's from the beginning still in there, like Sandra Oh, Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers and ofcourse mister McDreamy himself, Patrick Dempsey.. But then all of them left, like after that it became a drag, i mean i still like the show, but LOVE, no not like in the beginning. Grey's Anatomy is just one of the show's that got dragged on like waayyy to long. I truly think this should be the last season, i mean what more do we need? Better to stop when still like by all.
0	"I have not read the books but I have heard for years about this great series. I was cautiously optimistic when I heard about Benioff & Weiss doing the adaptation for Netflix because they would have a completed work to adapt. They did a wonderful job on GOT until they ran out of Martin's source material. If these books were as good as they are said to be, there must have been a lot changed or lost in bringing it to Netflix.The first episode really drew me in. The scenes in China were great and a wonderful setup. I was anxious to see more. Then we meet the main characters (I agree with another reviewer's description of them as UK version of Friends). They do not in any way seem to act like scientists. But then this ""science fiction"" story seems to try and eliminate any vestige of real science. We are told that the world's super colliders are producing impossible results and that science is broken, but we are given not the slightest clue as to what those results might be. I guess we, the audience, are too stupid to understand. The list of unexplained illogic goes on. Why is Evans reading fairy tales to the aliens? Why is the nano fence a better way of destroying the ship than a bomb ? Why do the all powerful aliens need to recruit a cult on earth? And above all, we are really shooting a brain into space to meet and hopefully infiltrate the aliens? When this was brought up my first thought was that sixties classic ""They Saved Hitler's Brain"".There is more to telling a story than filming a series of scenes! There is a rushed feeling of this happened and then this happened and then this ... I think I am going to read the books to find out if they make more sense."
2	I really enjoy watching this show. The medical parts are fascinating, and most of the storylines are just fine. However, some of the plots just go on and on, episode after episode, when you just want them to move on. The ridiculous Denny plot, just for one. The 'ghost' storyline was ridiculous and stupid, and went on for sooo many episodes! I found myself skipping forward a lot just to get back to the normal parts of the show.Izzie is annoying, dramatic and selfish, but the other characters are better and more watchable.It is a good show, on the whole, and worth watching if you are undecided.
1	The whole series kinda takes its sweet time to get going. The first three episode, I find it they're a bit of a slog, I won't lie. But stick with it, trust me. I'm not usually a fan of shows that make you work for it, but in this case, it's worth the effort. The story starts picking up, and suddenly you're hooked, craving more details. But I gotta admit, the main characters felt kinda so-so. Like, they were okay, but nothing mind-blowing. Overall though, it's a solid watch.There is a good lesson for this series, our planet, the people and how we act on it. I have not read the book or watched some adaptation so I like the message.
0	I don't even know where to begin the fact that it has an 8.7 rating blows my mind.. Obviously I'm assuming they were voted by people who never played the game... the wasteland is weak.. enclave is weak.. death claws are pretty cool I'll give them that.. but life in the wasteland doesn't translate from the game to the show at all ! I feel like if they were going to change so much they shouldn't have tried to follow the story line just make a new path! Instead of watching I would suggest just redownloading the game if you don't still have it and just replaying it because you will have a far better experience... In conclusion this show is hurting me on the inside and I'm sad that I waited so long to watch it :(...
2	Let me tell you a story of twisting plots and deep character development and then in the last season just press shift-delete on all previous information and just fob the story off.Seasons 1-6 absolutely phenomenal Season 7 pretty decent Season 8 would have rather them have cancelled the show without ending it... as i could have rewatched seasons 1-7 with enjoyment now the whole thing is ruined and I'll never rewatch..
2	"Many people will criticize Martha because of her obsessed behaviors. It's true she needs a relationship. But In fact it's the trigger Donny's approach to her to get things gone crazy.I believe life always has two perspectives, one is a visible one and the other one is beyond earthly knowledge.In Muslim book Quran ( like the other God's book's) gave hints about those unearthly messages. In Surah As-Saff it says "" O you who believe! Why do you say things you won't do? Saying things you do not do is a matter of great wrath in the sight of Allah.""I think Donny's situation can be explained by the anger of God, as he initiated a hope for Martha which he never pursued. He planted seeds of empty promises and then those seeds return to him as a punishment!!!"
0	Dear Game of Thrones, I think we should start seeing other people, it's not you it's me, I'm taking the dog cuz I don't think you'll be able to care for him. Maybe in the future we can be friends, but I doubt it. I want your cheater always a cheater and you cheated on me. I'll go back to the books they were always better to me than you were anyways. No hard feelings. Take care of yourself.
0	As a longtime fan of Fallout, this was a mere paintjob of Fallout over countless modern-day ideals that would not exist in such a world.If you were expecting something more like Waterworld or Mad Max, solid shows that understood grit in a harsh world from the turn of the century, you will be dissapointed.There are no physical requirements for the Brotherhood of Steel. They allow their initiates to have guts in a world of scarcity. Everything is the modern DEI buzz with a coat of paint over it, the bones and soul of this world is not Fallout, it's our world with a holographic overlay.I don't think writers can even imagine worlds unlike our own anymore, unlike the elite tech companies and creative bubbles of the east and west coast. Over 200 years of radiation, scarcity, military cult purity tests, ignorance, and loss...we are still in the modern day with modern messages only an inch beneath the shallow surface of this 'world'.
1	Excruciatingly long, excruciatingly boring, what was going on??!!! The middle of the season was the only part that was semi-enjoyable but the rest was all over the place. There was so much going on, it was honestly annoying how fast and slow everything was. The 5 protagonists were also all over the place, how yall friends but none of yall know what's going on with each other. It just seemed like they over compensated by trying to overcomplicate and add unnecessary drama to the show. I will be extremely extremely shocked and confused if it got a season 2. I only finished because I really had to understand wtaf was going on.
2	Ever since the show was announced I was waiting for it , I love Bethesda games, grew up playing Skyrim but never tried out a fallout , but man this show was amazing, from the start till the end tying all the plot and giving each and every character a purpose, it's a trio linear story which gets tied to each other with several twists and turns , GHOUL is the best , Lucy is amazing the actor who played Lucy perfectly executed the role. Lucy's reaction to several surface stuff which she's seeing for the first time gets her soo surprised yet she's eager to find her dad without giving up is great , and the development of a regular apprentice soldier to a sword , 2nd in command to a literal legion army a faction called brotherhood of steel , the twists and turns leading to a great finale which shows both the past and the present before the bomb dropped, fallout has done it , it could have had more content even tho it was already entertaining it just made me want more of that dystopian world , I started playing the games enjoying every bit waiting for a second season Cheers.
1	At the time of this writing the show has a 7.9 rating. I suspect in time this will go down to around 7.2 although personally I think it deserves a 6.Too harsh? I don't think so. While I didn't hate the show and am not one of those people who need or expect all adaptations to adhere strictly to the source material I think if you are going to make changes in your adaptation they should make sense and make some sort of improvement. This show failed on both scores. The original books by author Cixin Liu were hard sci-fi and brilliant in scope and imagination. The adaptation dumbs down the source material for TV and makes changes to appease the political viewers. None of this is an improvement. All it achieves is it takes everything that made the books so different from everything else out there and turns it into the same kind of Hollywood tripe that's a dime a dozen these days.
0	I'm quite surprised with the hype around this TV series. Underneath this historical / fantasy optics, paired with sensationalist portrayals like violence and sexualisation, there's not a lot of substance or consistency to the overall story. Just like the books.I didn't see any reason for the rape and sadistic scenes to add any realism when it's clear this is fantasy, there's dragons in it for crying out loud. If you like that kind of horror fantasy, maybe it's your thing.I don't think the quality of the visuals was very good either, it's filmed like those low budget history documentary reenactments, and you can tell the actors are wearing wigs etc.Some scenes dragged with the dialogues and I barely felt anything for the characters including the Starks. The various arcs of characters wasn't written with a complex or grand design, more like a soap opera of characters and groups coming and going.I barely made it to Season 5. I'm not surprised to hear fans disappointed with season 8, I hardly saw any clever plots to hold the story together in the first place.This really is for shock scenes and soap opera type entertainment, sprinkled with a bit of fantasy motif on the side. I don't know how well this will stand the test of time, if anything it could be something to watch just for laughs.
1	Ripley is about a scoundrel New Yorker, down on his luck, who finds himself propelled into an adjacent look at Italian luxury via the father of an old acquaintance. Through various devious means the main character pursues that luxury for himself, only to set various chaotic events into motion. Can Ripley stay one step ahead of his own misdeeds?The easiest place to start with Ripley is it's look and feel established by black and white presentation. I'd go as far as saying it's a technical masterpiece. Every episode has an array of incredible shots in well lit/thought out locations. In my opinion the look of this show is easily the best part and the main reason I completed the season.The secondary reason was I thought this show was hilarious. The blundering nature of the main character is black comedy gold, and the scenes are very consistent in delivering that entertainment.Otherwise? I thought the show was OK at best. I love the main character as an actor, but I think part of the comedy is likely due to improper casting. I can't say bad casting, because Andrew Scott delivers a consistent performance that I really enjoyed. But some of the scenes are preposterous. These occasional scenes destroy any chance of me really taking Ripley seriously.It's also too long, and at times truly boring in terms of delivery of content. The visuals, really all technical qualities keep every moment afloat with merit, but patience is required to enjoy the slow paced approach.For me the slow pace is the double edged sword of this show. On one side it meanders between major events, but! When those events occur, Ripley really extends the duration of highly entertaining scenes in a satisfying way.
0	As a final year med student about to be a neurosurgery intern in two months, I have spent several years in hospitals and several months as a subintern at major hospitals throughout the country. This is one of the most unrealistic medical shows I have ever seen. I'm sure it's fine as a drama or soap opera but don't expect any accurate depiction of what things are really like in surgery. Nobody expects an intern to operate solo. Getting a Chinese interpreter takes 5 minutes. Even a junior med student knows that. Interns and residents are not nearly as dumb as they are portrayed here. The job of the intern is to do scut work. It's really not that hard. You're just a glorified secretary for your superiors. You don't save lives. You don't dole out bad news to family. You don't really even scrub into cases that much. Cut-throat competitiveness is the exception among interns. Camaraderie is the norm. Also, for God's sake nobody touches their mask with bloody gloves. You don't take off your mask in the OR to talk. I could go on and on. It would be nice if Hollywood would hire even a med student as a consultant and pay them a nominal wage to get a little shred of realism.I might sound overly critical but the lack of insight in Grey's Anatomy is not simply annoying but actually forces you to not take the show seriously. On the other hand ER was the most faithful in this regard and I guess that's expected since it was produced by Michael Creighton. Too bad it was not about surgeons. Even Scrubs is much more accurate and ten times more entertaining. I bought two episodes of Grey's. That's 90 minutes and 4 bucks I'll never get back. I should have just read my Greenberg instead...I may be a tough customer because life on the surgical wards is truly exciting not only in terms of the science and medicine but in terms of social drama. Nothing I have seen on television or movies even comes close to capturing this real life excitement and drama on all these levels.
0	In a disturbing twist of events, a deeply troubled individual attempts to justify their role in enabling another disturbed person to become a stalker, all under the guise of being excessively nice. This unsettling narrative unfolds as a seemingly unfunny comedian shamelessly exploits the vulnerabilities of a troubled woman, all in pursuit of fame. Through self-aggrandizement, the individual paints themselves as a martyr of kindness, but the underlying tragedy lies in their manipulation and exploitation of vulnerable individuals for personal gain. This sad tale serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked narcissism and the insidious nature of people-pleasing behaviors.
2	"I love the fallout franchise and have hundreds of hours of play time. The storyline and the lore is really what I find captivating about the whole franchise. I thought they did a great job on the series and for me, it's about the details which I felt they nailed. My only complaint is the story arc feels all over the place. It's fallout 76 meets elements of fallout 3, some new Vegas with fallout 4 storyline but in the desert. I was looking for something more connected to at least one of the game storylines. I love the characters, especially the ghoul, the ""serum"" Dr. Guy and of course Lucy. The flash forwards and then backwards admittedly are a bit hard to follow. I will have to watch it all over again so that I can ""get it""."
0	To be honest I only watched one and a half episodes.. that's all I could stomach. How do you take a novel that is rooted in scientific expression and decide removing any hint of actual science is the way to go for the TV adaptation. This series appears to be glossing over everything related to the detailed physics of our universe. It's mentioned enough but not nearly to the point where you understand why any scientist would take their own life when physical laws break down. I understand you have to cater to a larger general audience but there's no reason to think people in general aren't sophisticated enough to take interest. Still, that could have been forgiven if you cast appropriately and or with an ounce of respect for the source material, strike out there as well. There is no way these blokes convince any functioning audience that they are our are best and brightest. Not going to go into detail but they are in fact the most boring, self absorbed, condescending, relationship challenged, I'm better than you individuals you'll ever find collected on a sci-fi TV series (well.. maybe Sam from GOT was ok). Speaking of that, the gender swapping political correctness, what the what. I'm all for expressed creativity but Netflix really disappoints here as they were the ones who green lit this atrocity. From the book there is so much interesting content, character dialog, and relatable individuals to pull from. With this story's origins why choose this one to layer in all the empty calories of the modern day Hollywood agenda...
2	I was searching the vastness of the TV-verse for something new to watch and clicked on the Rookie, from the first episode I was hooked! The acting is great! Really feels like your watching real police procedures! The stories are well written and the comedian element in each episode is priceless!! Haven't enjoyed a show this much in years! Starting over In life has never been this entertaining!
1	I tried to keep going for 20 minutes, but I just couldn't do it anymore. In the evening I want to relax and watch series without having to read subtitles all the time.Why has a language barrier been deliberately built in here, I just want to relax in the evening.You can't concentrate on the movie because you have to read all the time except when the Dutch and Portuguese are speaking, then it's in German, the rest is felt to be 99% in Japanese.Too bad, that makes the series unwatchable for me.Apart from that, I didn't think the picture on my 4k TV was that great either.Take it or leave it.
0	"I recommend you just go play the games instead. Fallout doesn't translate well to a tvshow adaptation. It's so laugh out loud bad at times, and it hurts to watch another great franchise getting turned into some awkward rom-com social awarness, commercialised comedy and it will cast a loong negative shadow on future installments and all my interest has absolutely vained considerably.I would say that alot of props, decor and attention to details are commendable but in the bigger picture the actors and the action sequences doesn't sell the illusion.It's the same fate that happened to starwars. Instead of being the most unique and epic scifi that ever existed, where every little trinket, robot and creature felt organic in its enviroments. Now it's the opposite of cool, its a empty CGI asteroid hurling itself into a black hole of nothingness, a cashgrab with neverending fetch quests. Fallout is on that same trajectory.There's not a single actor that has any screen charisma or deliver any convincing performances except Kyle. He seems oblivious to whatever fallout is, and that makes his acting convincing. There's no sense of danger or urgency in these straight to videogame-y scenes. ""Think comedy with terrible cgi effects and cheesy, monotonious performances."" The worst part of it all, is the extremely annoying lead characters wich i couldn't stand. It's impossible to root for these smiley faced protagonists that seems to take everything as a huge joke. The realism and dispair of an apocalyptic wasteland feels more like a staged theme park instead of stepping into a nuclear nightmare.The Fallout games pitch black humor was 100% derived from the absolute hopelessness and wackyness of this crumbled, gritty world. Not with bad oneliners like in the show.I truly believe that the only director that could have captured Fallout's essence, atmosphere, the nightmarish mutated creatures and gore is Paul Verhoeven circa 90s.If you like Vanilla coke instead of Nuka coke i guess this is the family friendly version of Fallout."
1	"S4e14: how does a woman in spiked mininum-3"" high-heeled pumps with her hands cuffed behind her back outrun anyone, never mind a trained police officer? And it us clear Fillion has gotten fit over the previous couple of seasons. And he can't catch this high-heeled handcuffed woman who had a couple of 2nds headstart on him. With this 4th season, the writing has gotten super sloppy and so careless. The writers have clearly lost their enthusiasm. They've stopped caring. With this last season I've been yelling at the tv because it's so frustration. Characters flip-flop; ecen tho having gained more existence, they do stupid things they wouldn't have done info the 2 previous seasons.I am aware that one may need to suspend disbelief at the door, but the maintenance of the disbelief is so taxing it's annoying. I used to praise this show. But, like i said, it has gotten so sloppy that it's actually insulting. Too bad. Love Fillion. Loved him in Firefly. Didn't catch Castle. Writers, give your work some TLC. Take some pride in your work."
2	I have been watching this show because by of Nathan Fillion as I loved him in castle. But this show is topping it for me. I must confess I was pissed when the killed the female captain in season 1, she was a force of her own. But the season 2 is shaping up to be great. Every episode is better than the last.
2	This show was a rollercoaster, that's the only word I would use. There was romance, heartbreak, tragedy, comedy and lot and lots of drama. The show was everything to me at one point, I admit I had a slightly concerning attachment to it. However, it wasn't the same after they killed off Mark and Lexie, Derek died, Alex left and Covid was introduced. The show ran on too long, it should've have ended a year after Dereks death. As soon as my favourite characters started leaving, I was annoyed and hurt. I haven't finished the 17tb season as it's too long for me and I have lost interest. It's the only show I have never watched until the end, mainly because it's still going. The seasons before all of that were amazing and entertaining. I loved all the different plots and twists. I think it's fair to say some deaths were very unnecessary. I wish I had the patience and will power to finish it, but sadly I am defeated.
0	At the beginning of the first season it was really entertaining and easy until they started ro make it serious which was bad move cuz the action was cringey and embarrassing to watchSeason 3 is complete disaster very weak dialog that you even know the words cuz it's in every profile in social mediaSome casting are very bad especially ( Lucy and and Jackson actors ) not talented and very awkwardI hope season 4 come back entertaining and easy instead of seriousness that doesn't suit the show.
1	This show goes seriously downhill after they all stop playing the weird video game, and worst of all, they kill off the best character halfway through the series.Benedict Wong is incredible in it and the first few episodes are brilliant and seriously compelling, but it all goes very wrong around the episode 5 mark. Somehow the threat of alien invasion sends the show into the territory of tedium. I agree with others about the serious miscasting of many of the scientist characters- the Auggie and Saul characters in particular don't seem to quite have the gravitas to pull it off, and as the show rests quite heavily on their shoulders, their miscasting really is quite a drawback.
0	"Like every other modern movie/show, you can't care about the main characters, and therefore can't care what happens in the rest of the show.All lines are written robotically. Some actors appear to bring a little humanity to them, but ultimately this is 99% of the show. Contrived robotic lines.Actors stare or speak perfectly smooth, always waiting for their turn.All ""kicks"" or drama is based around betrayal, as if this is high drama for robots... no human drama is seen anywhere... such as itchy clothes, things getting in the way, team work, personal style (hair, talking, walking, motivations).On top of the robotic script, actors, and drama, the show is also pushing gore desensitisation, and acting tough, and this is supposed to be sold to teenagers interested in video games..."
0	The Rookie is another. And I mean another police, cop, criminal show. Yes. They still can't make something new. Creativity is at 0.This show is like any other. And I mean any other police, cop, criminal show. You got your cliche characters aka cop squad. I've seen this before. I've been here before and I'm sick of it.This show however isn't all serious like the rest of them. It has a light, comedy element to it and it doesn't help.The show overall isn't that good. I doubt it was supposed to be good because they have done the cop and police show thing since forever. With the same types of characters and each time they end the same way.Please don't watch this.
2	To be honest, i was not expecting much, but maybe because of that, i found it to be very good. Acting is above average, story is fine and there are so many elements reproduced near accuratelly from the game: monsters, weapons, terminals, basically...all.There is dark humour, enough horror scenes, and quite a complex environment with characters and places.There are some episodes that lack substance, but overall, it is a successfull first season. I just hope they will keep it like that with the future one(s) also.I would like and hope that they will add more action to it (just a personal wish).Waiting for next season.
2	The three books by Liu Cixin changed my life. They are by far the best science fiction books I have ever read. The imagination, the science, the philosophy, these books are meant to change you, and the way you see the world and the universe.I was deeply worried about a Netflix adaptation, but I must say I have been glued to this show for it's entire runtime. The main elements are there, and well produced. The CGI is mostly on par, with some scenes far below the standard imposed by the recent Dune movies, but still sufficient for the experience to be great.The weak part of the books, although this is a matter of personal preference, has always been the human aspect of the grand story. The characters in every books (except maybe the second one), are bland, simple cogs in a massive wheel that is the fate of the unierse.The writers here decided to take a different route by embedding this grand story in a very human-scale story of friendship and love between five(six) humans. I was not sold at first, but quickly embraced it. Especially in the last few episodes of season 1. The first book is mostly covered in 5 episodes, so the episodes 6-7-8 use content from the other books and spend more time to dive in the characters who will all take the roles often given to secondary individuals, or by the single main character in the book. Note that in the book the main character does change between books.This decision by the co-producer is a great one, that will most likely displease those who want a perfect rendition. But even if you do decide that this british-centric group of friend is not your cup of tea (no pun intended), I cannot believe any fan of the book giving less than 7/10 for this one, since the main plot, and main events are respected in their whole. Although episodes 3-4-5 are the action-pacted one, I really enjoyed the human scale of episode 6-7-8, and it made me re-discover what is at stake in the books. Making me wish for a second season already.So if you enjoyed the book, don't read the negative reviews, plus yourself in, embrace the little differences, and enjoy. It's worth the ride.
1	I've watched the first 3 episodes and I started watching with great scepticism, that it would be a 'starts good but fizzles out' series.I also like a good post apocalypse story, this is definitely one of those.I gather it's based on a game, i've never seen the game, but it does have an interesting game vibe that is appealing. It doesn't take itself too seriously, yet you are engrossed in the characters and their individual stories (however bizarre)Now I have to watch the remaining episodes and I do hope it continues to the same standard as the first 3 episodes.Solid 7.5/10 and may well increase to an 8/10 by the end .Very watchable.
1	As other users have mentioned, the first few seasons (1-6) of the show were a phenomenon. A story that had us gossip, speculate, theorize, and enjoy for years.But somewhere after Season 6, the show ran out of book material and into uncharted waters. Blinded by their past success, I assume the show runners felt they were up to the task of taking it to a proper end.In Season 7 you could notice signs of the downfall, like they were trying to foreshadow it.And then Season 8 happened. After a 2 year break the anticipation was as high as it can be. After each failed episode, illogical character arc, rich story line butchered or forgotten, I'd tell myself that maybe the next episode will redeem the show. But it never came.I will remember this show not for what it was, but for what it could have been. I'm giving it 7 stars. One for each episode that I liked. My only consolation now is that GRRM will finish the books, so that I can how the story should have ended.
2	So first off been a Fallout fan actually since Wasteland.I went into this show with low expectations based on the plummet the games have seen recently.I noticed it only had one major actor I know Walton Goggins.Without spoiling much the first Ep was awkward.However once things got going like in the real games, it was dark and dirty outside.I enjoyed a good many nods to various games though out of base context.I liked the usage of Pipboy which was a staple in games.The FX are weird some are good some seem a bit cheap but ok for a show.The thing that makes this show a 9 to me is even though they screw up a lot, they make up with fun characters and good recoveries.So many videogame or any other media based shows are just filler with little else.I am looking forward to the next season.
1	This show is made to ruin people's careers. This show has so many gaps running non-weekly as you don't want to see it anymore. After 2 gaps I ended watching it. I will never wait 1 month for 1 episode that must run weekly and even so when you are making us wait another month next month that's wrong. Either you have a strategy to run it with constancy or shut it off. You are doing wrong to these people who play those characters. Too bad it has so many gaps.
1	I had the rating at 9 originally. This was one of the best shows on television. Unexpected twist that surprised me, but still made total sense in-universe, had me on my toes. A total lack of plot armor made me fear for my favorite characters like no other show or movie had for a very long time. The politics, the intrigues, the whole story had me in its grip.Then season 8 happened. From no plot armor, the show went to 110% plot armor. The politics are suddenly laughably bad and simple. Characters are propped up while others are torn down for what I can only speculate are the writers injecting hollywood politics into the show. Nothing against strong female characters, some of my favorite movies have female leads, but when it is so obvious that there's an agenda at play, like it is in GoT towards the end, it's just off-putting.The writing was deteriorating since the show overtook the books, but season 8 is bafflingly bad. There's still a few episodes to go, but after episode 3 and 4 I've lost all hope and will stop watching the show alltogether.Such a promising show that ends on such a low note is a shame. GoT has lost all rewatchability and I will probably never watch another episode of this show again and neither will I recommend it to anyone.I've changed my rating from 9 to 5 because the first 4 to 5 seasons are still superb. But the underwhelming and badly written conclusion destroys everything good about the show that came before. A real shame and a lost opportunity. The writers should feel bad and ashamed.
0	Went downhill as long as you run out of book material
0	"I had high hopes for this title as I love the original book so much, and like the Chinese TV series.However, this one make a great sci-fi with great story settings, DEEP PHILOSOPHY and SCIENCE discussions into a plain and simple ""there's some bad alien and bad guy, let's fight them together in the group of CHOSEN ONES, and we should have complex love, sex and other relationships"" story.1st, all characters are kind of lack of depth. Especially Ye Wenjie, who was a soul character, has very complex background and thoughts, so she once hate human, then begin to love some of the human, feeling a little conflict on welcoming the 3 body alien, but still lean towards 3 body alien may bring better things to human. In this movie, I only see hate, blind belief, and... sex? Saul Durand is the role of Luo Ji, who is key to all 3 books, however, he looks like a minor role the whole season, then at last 2 episode, suddenly push him to become a wallfacer. Auggie Salazar should be an important scientist character, but never saw she really worked on science stuff, more like an entrepreneur who drinks and smokes a lot, and always unable to resist the impulse, doesn't seem very rational.2nd, all major storylines are very rushed, it's like suddenly some setting jumped out, without enough, or even no scenes to develop the story. Like why we choose the nano line to cut the ship, why we need wallfacer, all like from nowhere.3rd, the details and story logic are bad. Initially, why Ye Wenjie took the blame on the forbidden book is not clear, just due to blind love on someone who betrayed her? Why is everything about a small group of people from Oxford? Just because they are THE CHOSEN ONES? Why use nano technology to cut the boat? Seems Evans doesn't want to destroy the hard drive at all, her run for mins and didn't destroy it, Just Sent SWAT TEAM! Why did Saul sit with Da Shi in an open Motel Garden after the assassin? He is eager to be killed? How does the cutting edge VR headset come from? Even though 3 body provide the design, Earth doesn't have the equipment and technology to manufacture those kinds of things yet!4th, the visual effect is not good enough, does the universe blink like broken lights? No details on the cutting boat scene also.Last but not least, a lot of important deeper conversation are gone, mainly ALL DEEPER PHILOSOPHY and SCIENCE discussions are missing from this TV series, make the story from a great personal, social and science discussion, into a plain and simple ""there's some bad alien and bad guy, let's fight them together in the group of CHOSEN ONES"" story."
0	I got 17 minutes into it and turned it off. This does look like it can be a great TV series, but it is not suitable for people like me who like to multitask while watching TV. I'm busy. I am working from home. I like watching TV shows in the background while working on my computer. If I like the show, I'll usually binge watch it again, like I did with Vikings. Even though I am working while watching TV, I can generally get a good sense for what is happening and can keep up with the show.However, Shogun is not for those who like to multitask. It requires intent watching because a good deal of it is not in English. I understand the creators want to keep authenticity, but I intentionally used the example of Vikings. Vikings was a great show, yet it was in English.Hopefully, I will be able to find it with English dubbed down the road, but to not have it in English from the get go seems silly. Anyway, I'm disappointed because it does seem like a good series, but I can't waste time reading subtitles. I envy those who have the time to do so.
0	This is the what the third reincarnation of the book...and it fails... I clocked Stings daughter in half a second...and what point are they trying to make there? Freddie Miles character was hetro and stained the memory of Philip Seymour Hoffman. I did like the fact it was in black and white. But not much else. Make a movie you're passionate about and stop pandering to the few who make all the noise...I gagged my way through the entire series to see if anything was redeemable....and sadly no...should have looked into this before wasting my time on what could have been a great little series......
2	Baby reindeer would probably be the one of the few amongst the complete series that portray life so emotionally. It's not just a story of stalking, sexual abuse, emotional rollercoster or the transexiality but the story of a life.One of the best limited series in last few years on Netflix. Every minute spend is worth. What's not good in this series. The portrayal of Donny Dunn and Martha Scott just goes beyond imagination. The ending so fulfilling knowing the other side of the story is also been told. It completes the story with stating the purpose behind all that happened.It's a must watch guys.
0	Slow going, chemistry isn't there with the characters, nothing really reached out and pulled me in. Bland storyline.
2	This girl is either the most annoying actress OR the storyline she gets is annoying as hell! All she does is whine, whine, whine I swear! Does she get under anyone else's skin????? When I see her come on screen I just KNOW there's going to be a breakdown of annoying-ness. Why does she over react to EVERYTHING, DANG! It's gotten to the point where I just have to comment. Everyone else on the show is great. They seem balanced. However, April is annoying as soon as I see her face and she opens her mouth! I don't want to give a bad review to the actress, but instead to the character....understand? I'm sure the actress is a wonderful woman, but man! Poor girl has the worst lines ever! Too annoying writers!
0	"Saw this mysterious series starting on Netflix and decided to give it a try. I had never heard of the books, so I had no idea what this was about, but very quickly realized, okay, it's an alien invasion story. Let's see where this goes.The initial setup was intriguing with the visions, the VR headset, and some kind of secret investigation into all of it. And then it all fell apart for me in one scene - the scene where the alien cult leader on the ship is telling his alien overlords the story of Little Red Riding Hood, and they just don't get it. The alien voice says it's a lie and becomes shocked and horrified that humans lie! Then the aliens cut off all communication based on this revelation.Really? An alien species that has access to every aspect of human civilization doesn't know this?The aliens communicate using an elaborate VR game that represents their world's survival problem, and they don't get metaphor? It IS a metaphor.The aliens display themselves as a Ninja lady because their real form would be too disturbing for the humans, and they don't recognize this as deception... i.e., lying?Then when the leader of the intelligence agency along with other smart characters all put on their VR headsets to view the aliens' presentation on sophons, none of them call the aliens out on their obvious BS. They've all heard the recording of the conversation. Why don't any of these smart people say, ""Hey, aliens, you're lying to us right now by not revealing your true form! And you're so smart yet you don't get that the wolf story was a metaphor about not trusting people... exactly the lesson you learned, and we should have learned, because that's how we teach children."" Nope, no character ever realizes this, which means none of the writers realize it either. In fact, it's like the writers have never seen an alien invasion movie in their life. They play with these tropes like they just discovered them for the first time ever. While we the viewers have seen these things used in countless media.Thematically, there's an exchange that sums up this entire series. The intel director asks the Chinese investigator,""You're going to be watching this kid for the rest of your life, are you okay with that?"" The investigator replies, ""Do I have a choice?"" The director says, ""No."" The investigator answers, ""Then I'm okay with it.""From the beginning when the young Chinese girl is taken to work at the observatory to this point, no one seems to have any choice. Even the guy who refuses to be a ""Wall Watcher"" (or whatever it is) ultimately has no choice. The nanofiber girl wants out, but they still use her work for the ill fated frozen head project... which is so dumb... such an incredibly dumb idea, and yet no one can speak up and say that. It almost makes you forgive the lady who called the aliens in the first place. Because thematically, we're just replacing one authoritarian system for another and hoping the next one is more benevolent and effective.They clearly need to call up a Bruce Willis or Will Smith to deal with these aliens, because the current team is not up to the task..."
2	I really enjoy the show and hope to see it picked up for more seasons.
0	I'm not a fan of the books. Actually I've only read the second book on a recommendation of a friend who said that he really liked the second and you don't need a lot of background info from the first to understand what is going on.The main premise of the books is more or less ok, but the Cultural Revolution inserts I felt were really badly written and full of adolescent cliche and overall, I never felt it was anywhere close to the best sci-fi books. I know that the trilogy has a lot of fans, but I thought it was some sort of a fluke.When I heard that Benioff & Weiss were adapting the books for a Netflix series, I thought that maybe I missed something in the books and given that I was a big fan of Game of Thrones series (and, actually, not that big fans of the books), I thought they might pull off a strong series even if the source material was 'meh'.Well, watched three episodes and had to conclude that this is simply bad - unbelievable plot, unbelievable characters, slow pace, zero empathy to anyone and anything happening on the screen - basically, everything that could go wrong did go wrong here. A blinking night sky was actually the last nail in the coffin, I have zero interest watching a series where extraterrestrial force is so unsubtle and illogical. It's just silly and a waste of time.
1	First and foremost, all the actors are truly exceptional. However, as I delved deeper into the narrative, I began to question whether I was witnessing a profound human drama or a story about a mentally unstable man. The chaos surrounding the protagonist seemed largely self-inflicted, leading to a sense of confusion. While the grooming scene was remarkably authentic, the confession and coming-out scenes felt somewhat contrived. Perhaps I am still struggling to understand why he identified with Martha and why he fell so deeply in love with Teri. Nevertheless, I find myself intrigued by the genuine events that inspired this story.
1	Golly. I had high hopes for this one based on a few reviews I read. But geez, nothing could have prepared me for my disappointment.Apart from exploring some slightly intriguing sciency/fictiony ideas, the dialogue is only marginally better than a B-Grade soap opera, and no amount of acting chops could improve that. Sadly, there wasn't anyone capable of delivering a performance to even try to raise the standard.Some giant leaps in plot development, leaving too many questions unanswered is also a bit of a problem.Honestly, 5/10 is probably a bit generous, but I felt sorry for the crew and caterers.
1	In the last season every 5 minutes I get reminded that black lives matter... Gets boring fast. That's a 6, but if you don't mind that it could be 8-8.5.
2	Seasons 1-7 rated a 10 for me .... Season 8, a 1 or 2. Stay in suspense and skip the last season if you are new to the series, you'll only be angered and frustrated by season 8.
1	"I was surprised that I generally like this show, but it is well acted, well directed, and have plenty of good characters to keep you invested.The problem here is that the show turns into a regular day time soap opera fairly quickly and that the characters, albeit lovely and great, are also mostly just there and are just soapy rather than growing developing persons. Another issue I have with this show is the sound design and music, which is actually kinda bad. I almost get the feeling the show-runners want to portrait a 1970s cop show and put in music and sound design to match. This is also a bit cliche. Most storylines and events we have seen a hundred times over and together with the soapy feel the show often turns into a chore. My final objection is that these police officers are tasks with solving murders, being arson specialists, they go undercover, they work with the FBI, they interact with and interview serial killers, and they solve all types of crimes... but they are normal beat cops... normal officers. When they for the 111th time singlehandedly solve a murder I'm just so over it.With that said this is still a okay/good TV, especially for today. Compared to most other shows today this is good. I am especially happy with the acting and general feel of the show. The directors use the ""shaky cam"" and ""body cam"" to almost perfection. Another thing which they nail is the extras and temporary actors playing villains, drug dealers etc. They are all very greatly cast and very well acted, and that helps immensely to sell the show.I have a few other nitpicks and positives, but at the end of the day this is a well acted, good procedural drama that, despite the somewhat soapy feel and cliches, is worth a watch. Perhaps the only really negative thing to say is that it overstays its welcome. This show as gone on for too long already after 2 seasons, and currently we are on its 6th. Don't get me wrong, this is still watchable, but there is no reason to drag this out. The writing and acting is not that great.Worth a watch and a 6/10 from me, but don't overthink it. What make this show work is the acting and the characters, but in the long run that is not enough."
0	Very poor acting and direction. May be poor casting choice - Whenever Ms Maclean and Maximus are shown - they simply destroyed their characters. It certainly killed the vibe of the game. Ms maclean character seemed portrayed as a teen whereas she is an adult who has zero to none understanding about outside world/zero self defence and she lived due to mercy of others. Though she is attacked, she behaves like a teen - no seriousness at all. Whereas maximus - his character is simply powerless. Play the game folks. Only entertainment is ghoul - superb acting and casting choice. Also this confuses - who are the actual target audience.
2	Shogun is everything I hoped it would be and more. I've been looking forward to this ever since I first heard about it. My excitement grew even more when I saw the trailer. On top that it's gotten great reviews and currently has a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. I thought my expectations were going to be too much and it'd be a let down but it's not. It's everything I'd hoped and more. I love this kind of genre. This premise kind of looked like The Last Samurai movie with Tom Cruise and I loved that movie as well. The story is told from the perspective of a British hero named John Blackthorne and his crew as they help Lord Torango in his war. This series just pulls you into their world and doesn't let go and you don't want it to. I've enjoyed every second of this.
1	"My favorite part of the entire series was the opening sequence that shows the bombs dropping, and even that I had some issues with, like nukes dont explode slowly enough for people to have time to say ""oh no honey thats just smoke from a fire"" (watch the trinity test footage). Im all for dramatic effect, but make it realistic. That being said, the scene was intense and beautifully acted by Goggins and I got goosebumps. Sadly the rest of the series didnt have the same effectThe fallout series took a tone shift with the arrival of Fallout 4. Prior to that, yes humor and absurdity were present, but they were sprinkled in amongst the backdrop of a desolate dying world with cruelty and horror around every corner. In fallout 3, often the first person you encounter is a homeless guy begging for a sip of clean water. He's not goofy, weird, or absurd in any way, he's just a normal human. There are slavers that keep kids in cages with bomb collars around their neck. Thats the kind of world we're in. The show however feels like its turned that formula on its head. It feels more like humor and absurdity are now the primary focus with sprinklings of reminders that ""oh dont forget we're in a post apocolyptic wasteland"". And Fallout 4, which the show seems to be most emulating, seemed to be the beginning of that tone shift, where the colors were a little brighter, the characters a little wackier, the sense of dread a little less present. The show has taken this to the next level with brotherhood knights that act like delinquent teenagers, organ harvesting drug dealers that watch tv all day and act like stoners, and a goofy brain in a roomba being the mastermind behind a vault conspiracy. I wanted more scenes and characters like norm, moldaver, charlie whiteknife, and barbara, who took their circumstances very seriously and whose perfomances sucked me into the world.Then there's the issue of certain elements of the show feeling hollow and not given the weight or depth they deserve. Like the scene where all the big corporations are meeting with vault tec. It seemed way too easy for a meeting like that to have been spied on, barbara even noticed her pipboy was transmitting but decided to still attend that meeting with it on? Come on. Then she just casually says in the meeting ""by dropping the bomb ourselves"" admitting to all these ceo's present that vault tec is considering creating the nuclear holocaust themselves. Info like that you'd barely share with people inside the company let alone blurting it out point blank to other companies unless you know they're fully on board. And all these ceo's present were ok with the end of the world, the end of their empires, in exchange for a few vaults where they could run human experiments? Maybe they were but they didnt give any indication as to why. And vault tec said this would be an opportunity to end conflict by outliving all enemies and having a single monopoly. How? When you're giving away vaults to other companies with their own ideas on how to run things how does that result in a single monopoly and not just another bunch of factions bickering and warring over the right way to do things? It feels like there's so much missing here, so much that has been glossed over and just thrown together without attention to detail or nuance. This is the kind of meeting that you'd find in a climactic scene of a show like 24 or Homeland, where multiple government agencies have expended mind boggling amounts of time and resources to get a recording of, that we as the viewer have been slowly piecing together over the course of the season, but in fallout this incredibly precious info feels unearned and like its just being lazily told to us for a plot point. The idea that vault tec started the war is something that people have been speculating since the inception of the fallout series and it didnt feel like the grand revelation it deserved to be.Another culprit of this was the scene where Lucy learns about her father. I didnt buy the father's performance trying to stop Moldaver from revealing the truth. And Lucy seemed to accept this reality way too easily (you're gonna believe that your father who you love nuked a town cause some lady who killed your friends and family told you so?) Again just lacked depth and nuance and left me wanting.My hope for season 2 is that we get more depth and nuance and the creators lean more into the gritty nature of the earlier fallout entries and lose some of the ""oh darn i missed every shot cause I suck without a scope on"" goofiness."
0	It was fun, it was witty, it was charming.That was at the beginning of Grey's anatomy: during Season 1. Elle Pompeo was cute, Patrick Dempsey was handsome, and Katherine Heigl was gorgeous.The second season turned the characters into selfish self-centered individuals that constantly whine about their own little selves. There is nothing enjoyable: every time a moral dilemma is presented, they make the wrong ethical choice in the name of love, friendship, whatever. Doctors must go wild when they watch that show. It is completely unbelievable.Now, what happened to the actors: Ellen Pompeo looks like she has a stuffed nose all the time, Patrick Dempsey looks like he is about to cry on every frame, and they even ruined Katherine Heigl for me.Damn you.
1	Season 1 to 5 : 10/10 Season 6&7 : 8/10 Season 8 : 3/10. Hence the aggregate rating 7/10.
2	Visually stunning with good acting, dialogue, direction. Japanese representation is extremely authentic and feels like a native high-budget period piece (jidaigeki).Unfortunately, people unfamiliar with the historical backdrop and the characters might find the first episode to be a bit confusing and overwhelming with many characters introduced in a short period of time amid multiple international tensions. Those familiar with the original series or the books should be fine, and the rest of the series should be more enjoyable once the main characters and their roles are firmly fleshed out. If the production value continues in this manner, I very much look forward to the rest of this series.
2	"I am writing this section as I am experiencing the here-after, even though the here-now rears as the child of fifty. Ponder this question at will: has the abomination of the clear and sufficient stream of duration been enough for the child? This question is of a different tonal character than what has come before. The history of the English (let us call it that), the abolished and intricate web of flesh, has long since been present in the philosophical inquiry of the great Brentano. I will not be lengthy in this matter, but would withdraw any statements about the ""Sho gun"" (as it is correctly spelled!) and the ""Sho gin"" (as is customary for the apparition). Furthermore, this has been explained as a tower, a rising value of effort that encapsulates three different movements (again this magic number!). The way the English, or hereafter simply Man, adapts the here-now as a junction of positions is never quite clear. Nonetheless, returning to this ""review"" 400 days later, the notion appears sufficient."
2	The cinematography is simply outstanding and this is absolutely the lushest B&W production that I've ever seen. I'm so glad that they were brave-enough to shoot it in B&W. The settings are simply gorgeous, all told it's. Feast for the eyes. Andrew Scott is magnificent in a very restrained role. I've not read the book, but I do understand that this production is fairly faithful to it. It's amazing that this high of quality could exist on Netflix.The real star of the show are the various sets/locations, the expert cinematography, the writing, etc. I'm on my second round of binging this series.
0	It was bad enough when they killed off his first boss, the female lieutenant. But it got worse. Way worse. Can we please go back to the season 2 finale and have a do over? Please?
0	The Rookie was a semi entertaining show for the first couple seasons. Something to watch in case of boredom. John Nolan is an entertaining character with some great supporting characters as well. There is no way an LA Police Officer could have purchased the home he did. And real police don't have major gun battles with every shift. Storyline is so unrealistic it's sad. Then I'm the later seasons they started pushing leftist propaganda into their storyline. So I have stopped watching. I thought the show was about John Nolan. Instead it's about convincing the viewers to follow liberal politics. So you've lost this viewer because I don't think your political beliefs belong in my entertainment.
1	Half way of the show now, and honestly i think it's not half bad. Solid sci-fi screen adaptation, good pace and okayish CGI. I don't think screen adaptions must follow the original book, however it's still no nessisary to make this much changes, and divide characters like this. And i have to say it really not nessisary to be THIS MUCH political correct. I don't mind to see diversity of characters or femal power, but it was just carried out that makes you feel too forced. Some lines are out of context and just to be there for the political correctness, that's really unnecessary. Still i would like to recommend, it's still nice entertainment after all.
2	The plot has been simplified too much, skipping many developments, and the pace is too fast, leaving many areas unclearly explained. There's a lack of the gradual unfolding of the story that brings a sense of surprise. Liu Cixin's original work, especially the first part, focused heavily on character development, particularly Ye Wenjie, who throughout the entire book becomes too one-dimensional. Her emotions should be complex, and there should be differences in psychology between her youth and old age. The characters all feel too flat. However, Yun Tianming's adaptation is decent, and the actor's performance is excellent. The visual effects, especially the cosmic scenes, which were highly anticipated, lack the necessary impact. On the bright side, the gaming and dehydration aspects are satisfying, reminiscent of how I imagined them while reading. Overall, it's okay, but it's just that it's been simplified too much compared to the original.
1	I fell in love with the series from the first episode, I liked the main idea of how an aged person changes his life and profession. I think, season 1 is excellent, a balance between comedy and drama looks interesting. The second season is a little weaker, but still good. And then I saw the third, 4th season...Oh, boy. It's great when ideas about freedom, respect, freedom of speech are promoted in a cinema. But It's just a pity that in modern Western society and in modern cinema we do not see this, we see the propaganda of distorted, substituted concepts. The authors simply adjusted to modern fashion, just tried to please trends. We all hear the howls of different movements about equality, but the truth is that this is hypocrisy, because as soon as these communities get to the mouthpiece, they themselves begin to breed inequality, try to humiliate the opposite side, elevate themselves. It's pathetic. The picture of the world that the series paints is so sickly artificial, fake. I would be glad to see the script, where men and women are equal in their opportunities and rights, despite the fact that they are different in nature, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and that is great, diversity is great. But instead of the ideas that men and women are worth each other, that they need each other, instead of the ideas of goodness, the authors impose on us the idea that it is normal to humiliate and hate someone who is not like you. Just very veiled. For example, that a woman is better in everything, and a man is pathetic and insignificant. And they poke you with it in every episode, but if you're smart enough, you can't help but notice it. Yes, women are great, just like men, just like any healthy person. But the way the series tries to impose its distorted picture of the world is disrespectful to the viewer. I'm sorry that a good series has gone bad. The problem is not in the topic being raised, but in HOW it is done, clumsily, disrespectful.
0	I mean good for them for going as long as they have and hell ya Shonda. But this show is recycled writing over 20 years. The first couple seasons were pretty good, but i think that's because the actors were good and not the writing. I don't get why ppl are so obsessed. My little brother thinks im a hater but I'm just tryna live you know.
1	Very political correct. 50/50 white/black. Gays, lesbos.  Im getting used to it.
0	I've stopped viewing Grey's Anatomy in session 17. Only political content, no more entertainment only brain washing.
2	Shogun's first episode catched my interest. Shogun's second episode overwhelmed me.Shogun's third episode confirmed my greatest hope.This epic tale is a huge addition to the genre of historical dramas. It has great writing, brilliant atmosphere and music, loveable characters, amazing set pieces and costumes, satisfying action and a maturity long missed in Disney productions.The show reminds us of Game of Thrones itself, while in the same time standing on its own feet.I wanted to wait for the show to complete before reviewing it, but after the third episode I am certain my expectations will be fulfilled. My connection to the characters already feels like a strong bond and I am that intrigued to the story I want to binge the remaining episodes immediately.Without doubts I hereby call Shogun by the name it deserves: Masterpiece.
0	"I have never seen a show worse than this garbage. The writing is ridiculous, the ""storylines"" are so stupid that one story actually revolved around a doctor almost dying from an icicle. Yes, an icicle!!!!! Are you kidding me? I thought maybe this was supposed to be a comedy but I was informed it is indeed a drama. I don't understand how anyone can watch this show and think it's good or take it seriously. The acting is also horrific. I believe some of the stories have also been repeated season after season. Do everyone a favor and take this crap off of the air already. I know the network it is on struggles for good quality shows and this show is beyond ridiculous."
1	"Yes, this is quite unique. Yes, it's gritty. Yes, the acting for the most part is quite good. However, for those of us who have lived a relatively conventional life without drug abuse, repeated sexual attacks and self-torture, it's too awful to be watchable. I peaced out during episode 5 or 6 after enduring enough despicable behavior to last me a lifetime. The lead character is every bit as horrible in his way as the woman who stalks him, leading her on and keeping her around for his own gratification. I could find nothing redeeming about any of it and felt more like a voyeur than a viewer. It's depressing. It's frustrating. I'll leave this one to the cinema connoisseurs who ""get"" this sort of thing in a way I never will."
2	I know that the last season in particular is horrible and completely disfigures the series, but that's not why you should disregard the rest political intrigue was the best thing about GOT, after they dropped it the series started to go downhill... why were the writers so pretentious thinking they could do something BETTER than the books? RIDICULOUS! Until season 5 is a 9/10 season 6 is an 8/10 season 7 is a 7/10 season 8 is a 5/10 the costumes, the cinematography, the acting, the writing and the construction of plot and characters were perfect, a pity that all this has been thrown in the trash with the last seasons and the final episode is an FREAKY.
2	"With her Tom Ripley, the American writer Patricia HIGHSMITH created a ""man without qualities"" for the post-war period. There are already two great film adaptations of her great 1955 novel: PLEIN SOLEIL (1959) with Alain DELON (and Romy SCHNEIDER in a cameo) and THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY (1999) with Matt DAMON. Do we need another series? And then also in black and white pictures?Despite all the skepticism in advance, Steven ZAILLIAN (ACADEMY AWARD 1994 for the screenplay for SCHINDLER'S LIST) has created something masterful with Andrew SCOTT as Tom Ripley, which will hopefully be continued in the film adaptation of the four following Tom Ripley novels by the great master Patricia HIGHSMITH . Even those who already know the story from the novel itself or the two film adaptations mentioned will quickly be drawn under the spell of these calm and clear images. Episodes 3 and 5 are particularly impressive because of the calmly filmed action explosions.Instead of the mid-1950s, the action has been moved to the early 1960s, which can be heard in the first hits of the fantastic Italian singer MINA. The love for art in general and for Caravaggio in particular can also be better illustrated.While the film adaptation with Alain DELON was at least somewhat marred by an overly moral ending, forty years later Matt DAMON was able to emphasize the homoerotic component of the plot more strongly. This is also present in the NETFLIX series, but Ripley, played by Andrew SCOTT, is also simply a clever con artist who is primarily interested in the lure of riches and the beautiful life that comes with it. This certainly meets Patricia HIGHSMITH's intentions. Tom Ripley is what other people want to see him as. He doesn't really care whether he has to be heterosexual or homosexual. The main thing is that he can carry out his plans smoothly.Louis HOFMANN and John MALKOVICH can be seen in supporting roles. The latter plays a character that will become even more important in the Tom Ripley cosmos. A sequel is definitely planned by the makers. The producers also include DIOGENES ENTERTAINMENT, a subsidiary of DIOGENES Verlag from Zurich, which publishes the German-language translations of Patricia HIGHSMITH's works. Now all that's left to do is get the viewing numbers for NETFLIX right!"
2	"In my mind, Alain Delon in Rene Clement's 1960 ""Purple Noon"" was the definitive Tom Ripley. Beautiful and totally amoral. Anthony Minghella's 1999 ""The Talented Mr Ripley"" had a bland but thoughtful Tom Ripley who felt and suffered. Minghella had a superb script, Gwyneth Paltrow, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Cate Blanchett playing riveting, unforgettable characters. There was also John Malcovich in a Liliana Cavani version, and although I've seen it, I don''t remember it, isn't that terrible? And the Wim Wenders version with Dennis Hopper doesn't count, good film, but it doesn't count as a version of Patricia Highsmith's novel. Now this. Ripley, the series. Hours long, in black and white. My first reaction was to rejected it but the truth is that I finish seeing it over a week ago and stayed with me, I can't shake it off. Why I wonder. And the reason is very simple. Steven Zaillian's version is truly wonderful. He has de-glamorized it. The whole thing. The story, the characters. Oh the characters. I was so used to see beautiful people playing them, in gloriously glamorous locations. This version is stark and Andrew Scott is like a replicant. No emotions, not even a hint of them. Invisible. As a consequence we do all the work. We gasp or look away. He just goes on. I know I'm going to see Ripley again, maybe not tomorrow but soon. I suspect you will too."
0	Ok you're giving me a headache. Get rid of that stupid Skip Tracer Randy.
0	I really hate this show. It's really, really stupid in my humble opinion.Every single doctor in every single season hooks up with every single doctor or nurse (or sometimes even patients) of the opposite sex (or obviously the same sex if we're talking about one of the characters that is gay).Also the stories are ridiculous. People come into this same Seattle hospital every week with the most ridiculous injuries and problems. Some guy with an old world world two bomb stuck in his stomach that could detonate any minute. People who are poisonous. Lunatics. It's totally beyond belief.
2	S1 - S5 = Absolute Masterpiece, best show EVER S6 = Top tier, but a little slow and raggedy S7 = Overall below average season, writing starts to go downhill, but I have seen worse S8 = Absolute disaster, too many plot holes, and a rushed finaleFor the last two seasons, they should've given us all 10 episodes to play everything out. OR should have just given us another season. Character arcs were a bit rushed and too many questions in the end. Hated seeing one of my favorite shows go down in flames.
0	Its just average nothing special first seasons were great, they rushed into nowhere
2	3 Body Problem: The first novel in the trilogy by Cixin Liu has been adapted for television. Much of the action has been shifted to the UK with Liam Cunningham playing Wade the Intelligence Chief who is fighting the Aliens. Great to have an M with a Dublin accent! The china sequences set during the cultural Revolution are important to the development of the plot and even more so to one of the main character's attitudes towards the Aliens. The advanced VR games are neatly slotted into this series as is the a;iens ability to control some events from and be seen by some humans as lords. Conspiracies, assassinations, scientists committing suicide and a united UN Security Council (!) along with d centuries spanning plan allow the narrative to unfold. A dark series, lots of violence and gory deaths from the outset. Don't miss this masterful adaptation. Created by David Benioff, D. B. Weiss and Alexander Woo, based on the Hugo Award winning Chinese novel The Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin. Eight episodes on Netflix. 9/10.
1	For those who haven't read the books: go watch this. A lot of the amazing concepts are explored and shown beautifully on-screen. The production quality is fantastic. If you loved it, please read the books, they will allow you to explore everything in far greater detail and truly digest it.For those who have read the books: beware and have an open mind. I fully understand why they completely transplanted the setting and shuffled many of the characters, as well as the timeline. It's an ambitious effort, which I think didn't succeeded in the way they wanted. Some of the characters in the book, particularly book 2 and 3, are somewhat flat and one-dimensional. This is okay, as they really are just vessels to tell a great civilizational epic and study of the human condition. They tried to change that, making the show more character-driven. However, at the same time they rush things, leaving you little time to sit and ponder and making the character arcs even worse than they are in the books.But at the same time, the concepts are still amazingly brought. Some of the moments that you wonder how they will put them on the screen, are wonderfully executed. The final episode gave me goosebumps, you'll know what I'm talking about it.Enjoy and be happy that this story now has a great, approachable adaptation.
0	The sense of Japan , history and culture is excellent but ruined by the European angle and level of importance . That angle is the weakness and reduces the impact of the intrigue and chivalry of the clan history. Sanaa and sawai are brilliant and I loved every scene they were in but my enjoyment dropped when Jarvis as the English hero entered. Most in the west are unaware of the richness of the Japanese culture in the 17th century and this was an opportunity to explore same. I usually like dramas to stick to the book but in this instance I would have been very heavy for a heavily adapted screenplay.
2	Grey's Anatomy has been my ultimate guilty pleasure, my comfort place for years now. Ever since I started watching this, late in the game, I binged every episode. And 18 seasons later I still am, still love the stories, the humour and the locations. I visited Seattle in 2011 (wasn't watching the series at that point yet) and now I see all those landmarks I saw in real life and I can just imagine me walking there, meeting Meredith and all of Grey Sloan residents... As far as I'm concerned, this series can keep on going for many more seasons! Even when Ellen Pompeo would decide to stop playing Meredith Grey, there's a lot of other stories to tell. I've come to love each doctor, each resident, each nurse in this hospital! If there is one series that can bring me to tears, this is the one!
0	"After you finish watching this series, do you believe it ranks among the best or top three sci-fi series you've ever seen? If yes, then the series is deemed satisfactory. However, if you're unsure or feel it doesn't meet that standard, then it falls short.Why do I ask this question? Because the novel ""The Three-Body Problem"" is universally acknowledged as a masterpiece, even considered one of the greatest contemporary science fiction works worldwide. It's astonishing that such a celebrated novel has been adapted into a mundane romantic sci-fi series. Without having read the novel, you might find the series passable. But you need to understand a fact: the original novel's brilliance surpasses this series by a hundredfold.As to whether fidelity to the source material is crucial, I don't believe it is. If the screenwriter has better creative ideas, adaptations can be made. However, it's evident that the screenwriter likely didn't thoroughly read the original novel, as many brilliant parts have been omitted and replaced with irrelevant content. This is alarming and has led to numerous factual errors and distortions of the novel's core story.If the content of the original novel and this series were the same, it definitely wouldn't stand a chance at winning the Hugo Award.These are my feelings after carefully watching the entire series. If I hadn't read the original novel beforehand, I might also have found the plot not too bad. But I would undoubtedly be very puzzled - isn't this just an ordinary romantic sci-fi drama? Why is it being promoted as something so great worldwide?"
1	Such a great show for the first 2 seasons, the 3rd season was pretty good and then the 4th season becomes absolutely ludicrous. They go from roomie beat cops doing believable activities to suddenly flying to Guatemala to take on the cartel. Johns gf the firefighter is continually used as a paramedic on scene for some reason, the whole thing is bizarre. A second year patrol cop works with the fbi cia and so on. Such a shame because it would be an 8/9. If you're a fan of procedural cop shows this is still a very decent shout, it falls in line behind the shield, Bosch and south lands as far as LA cop shows go.
1	First 6 seasons. 10/10 Season 7 : 7/10 Season 8: 2/10
1	"Everyone complains about how Dany's arch. Personally, I think the personal story to be the best. She stopped examining herself and decided that everything she did was good and right. I don't have a problem with any of the acting or directing. Even the writing was spot on (and I know people have problems with it) . I only wish they put at least half as much thought into the ending as they did for the creation of those characters. The issue I have with the show is the HORRENDOUS lack of respect for LOGIC. Did ANYONE in this show CONSULT ANYONE who knew even a thimble worth of strategy!?A Frontal Assault by ""A"" Class Irregular cavalry against a MASSIVELY larger group of, essentially, steady infantry who NEVER suffer Morale issues? Why not just have them ride off a cliff!?Speaking of Dothraki...or, maybe call them the ""Wile E Coyote"" because no matter how many time we see them all die, they always come back.They died to a man in that ""Dramatic Effect"" charge. A bunch of them showed up at the Funeral. 1000s died to almost a man when the Iron Fleet attacked. Then Several thousand show up at the gates of Kings Landing!? I don't get it... when they die, do they multiply!?Speaking of obscene perversions of logic. How did a handful of people left alive in Winterfell become an army that could besiege King's Landing!?What happened to Cerci's plan to have Winterfell fight to a man against the Night King and the sweep up the remains with her army. It would have made perfect sense except for the Dracaris-ex that could destroy the world with enough bean burritos. That whole thing wreaked of a hasty (and highly illogical) plot change. It's Sloppy. It's practically Fan Fic in this regard."
2	What an amazing piece of writing and acting. This series was so thought provoking and unbelievably moving.. well acted and have to say Richard Gadd was excellent in the portrayal of himself, and Jessica Gunning was just as awesome as the infatuated stalker.Based on a true story this really showed how brutal and terrifying life can really be.So many awful badly written shows out there at the moment but this really captures the audience. I watched in 2 days and was gutted when it ended.Now I can empathise with all the poor innocent people that have been stalked and the fear that there is no end and no help out there. Shocking!Would definitely recommend this series 👍🏼
0	It was a brilliant show till episode number 16 in season one. The most powerful character in the play was the captain Zoë Anderson. The decision to kill her was one of the worst ones atleast me and my friend s stopped watching after her departure.I have a strong feeling that Nathan Fillon fought with her like he did with stana katic in castle. Whatever it was, there was no point of watching it after Zoë Anderson departure because the producer would have come with other similar goof ups later. So my view is , don't give it a try.I will not watch any series of Nathan again because he doesn't get along well on set with fellow actors.
0	Loved S1. Got through S2 and thought that the plots had taken quite a turn from reality and what any officer would face, even over a 30 year career. S3 used the show as a platform for a one sided political diatribe. I dropped it and won't be back.
1	"POTENTIAL SPOILERSI remember the very first time I started watching Game of Thrones. It was different , unexpected plot twists everywhere but it all made sense . The deaths of characters were not a ""shock device"" to be exploited but a plot device to drive the story further into a better ,much unexpected direction.After the show ran out of source material ie. George RR Martin's books the show took a massive hit. The episodes reduced in quality. Characters kept dying off for no reason whatsoever except shock value which to be fair got me maybe once then it became boring. The deaths don't mean anything and the story has gone up in flames due to what I can only assume to be a lack of imagination or lazy writing.The last season which is currently airing kills everything you hold dear (not talking about the characters) , the plot. A villain who was built up from the very first episode of the first season just killed off as a mere foot soldier by someone who we didn't see coming . That's all the show has become a show where anything can happen unless you're a main character. Where people die because it's shocking not because it's good for the plot.Also the show cuts off on story elements to showcase it's CGI. People just travel from place to place like there's a subway in the realm. All while showing it's incredible CGI battles , dragons and wolves which by the way don't really matter as they're just there to look pretty.The show now just kills anyone without any explanation as to why or how. Imagine this - you're flying on a dragon and a guy in a ship shoots 3 perfectly aimed shots on a flying dragon all while behind a rock structure where he cannot be seen yet he can see you. It's a ship not a pebble you can hide behind an island.I feel like the pitch for the last 3 seasons went something like this- ""Hey I know what'd be good. Let's kill some people not major characters thought and even if they do we'll resurrect them then have a couple of battles and viola we have a perfect show with no plot whatsoever""."
1	I was so looking forward to seeing this show because of Colin Farrell and the ratings are high. I've always like Colin Farrell but some of his choices of roles have not been great and I'm beginning to think it may be true once again.I found the first episode to be disappointing. It comes across contrived, things happen way too conveniently for the main character. It comes across as very poorly directed which makes the acting seem poor. Over acting act times.I'll give it a couple more episodes to see if it gets better but I suspect it won't.Even the editing is not good. Full of flashing images and comes across like nits trying too hard to be artsy.I found the first episode to be boring but well see if it picks up.
1	I love this show so much that I rewatch the old seasons on repeat. I am a true addict, however I've found myself losing interest over the last several years. It's gotten to the point that I'm praying it ends so that series isn't completely ruined for me...and boy are we close! I'm only still watching at this point because I feel like I've invested too much time not to see it through to the end. Now that they have announced Meredith's reduced role in season 19, I am literally dreading its return in October. Please end this series for the sake of it's fans. There are very few that have stuck around this long and we are nearing our breaking point.
1	So, now the Rookie and the LAPD are involved in filming their actions in relation to a Hollywood hero (i think) and Hollywood filming the cops, etc. Seriously a flawed idea and a waste of time to watch. Filming a bunch of cops in a TV show? Boring.
1	What even is this show anymore? Honestly, I was pretty much done after season 10, but I kept pushing because I was 10 seasons in. With each passing season, I hate this show more. I gave it 5 stars because those first 10 seasons were entertaining. I am currently on season 17, but I can't take it anymore. Major characters are being written off for no reason, constant Hail Marys for the ones I could care less about... it's hard to remain invested. This show is a freaking mess.
0	All dialogue and exposition. Anytime a show relies upon a narrator it means the the storyteller is weak and unskilled. Show, don't tell, that's cinema. This show is driven solely by plot and not character, which renders it soleless. If you want to waste your precious time in this world, then watch this show, or use it as a sedative. There's really nothing more to say, but they want more words or characters. Oh yeah, me and the wife couldn't get through the second episode. There is absolutely no cheer in this show. Zero humor, soap opera esq. For sure. It's also obviously try to be a version of Chinatown meets L. A Confidential.
1	This show was a 10. Then they ran out of source material and the writers ballsed it up. For example, they periodically made people dumb for plot reasons, applied plot armour, made things happen for no reason other than shock value (instead of reasons or decisions or consequences). Also, people started teleporting all over the place, character development was forgotten about, world-building abandoned, plotlines and foreshadowing dumped without reason. Things no longer had to have a reason to occur, only that they be shocking or surprising. The show stopped being about politics, and personal drama, and underhanded actions, and instead became an action show, removing anything that needed any thought, just action and action and shocks, with locations and the politics and personalities being afterthoughts if they were included. Then season 8 happened. Admittedly, everyone involved in season 8 was fantastic, the cast, the crew, every element of the show was beautifully done. Everyone involved in the show for this season should absolutely be proud of their amazing work... Except the script writers. Who were bad at their jobs. Unfortunately, no matter how well made and acted a show is (and it was brilliantly made and acted) if it's in service of an incompetently written script, then the writers do a disservice to everyone else. And the writers truly let down the show by not letting someone competent do the writing. The last season of the show just seemed to be written by lazy writers who just wanted to finish up so they could go ruin Star Wars. I left it as an 8/10, down from the 10/10 it used to be, because every aspect of the show was fantastic, and it was only let down by the writing after there was no more source material to adapt. Plus, hasn't Cersei being pregnant (and it was confirmed in interviews with the show runners that she was) been a thing to try and humanise her for like a year and a half in the show's chronology? She's not even showing yet. Alternatively, if she was only a month or two along and everything in between took place in a month or two, then horses and ships and walking in Westeros must be REALLY fast, and the characters age REALLY fast, considering the amount of travelling that took place between the pregnancy being announced and the end of the show. Especially considering Jamie went from Kings Landing (where the impregnating happened) to High Garden (I think he went there after, but it was a while ago so that might be wrong) to Kings Landing to Winterfell, fought in a war, moved in with Ser Brienne of Tarth, a time jump where they were serious (I think, it wasn't clear), and back to Kings Landing before Cersei had a baby bump.
1	I think that this series has a distinct, non-vulgar story with a factor of mystery and suspense, and it could have been much better than this had it not been for its poor implementation in terms of directing, writing dialogues, and events. I liked the diversity of languages, cultures, and races in this series, and I also liked the merging of realistic science with science fiction, which... It is considered an attractive idea, and they succeeded in combining them together, in addition to moving to the past and representing past events with a wonderful science fiction element. I also liked the characters of Soul Durand, Jack Rooney, Will, and Jin Cheng. This is in addition to good acting, wonderful photography, and very convincing CGI. There is some good comedy for the series and some symbolism For Oppenheimer's film, despite all these advantages, this series is full of many defects that spoil its story. The first of these defects is that some of the dialogues and conversations are boring and do not add any value or depth to the story. There is also the introduction of political agendas in a disgusting way, in addition of the presence of clear writing gaps and laziness. In writing the events and sequences of the story in a convincing way, such as shots of conclusion, analysis, and spying on the main characters without any evidence and without any preparation for these shots. Also, one of the drawbacks of this series is that the character of Auggie is an unpleasant, provocative, petty, and domineering character. I literally hated her appearance and shots. I could not sympathize with her. I was hoping it would end her scene fastly, in addition to the severe weakness in building some of the main characters of the series without adding any depth to these characters, such as the character of Mike Evans, who has illogical and unconvincing motives, as well as Detective Da Shi, who did not appear outside of his work except in literally two shots, while the rest of the series only worked as if he were a secondary character. On the side, there are no logical reasons for some of the events of the series, such as the reason for the Chinese army's attempt to communicate with aliens instead of developing weapons to fight the capitalists, and such as the reason for Yi Wenji's confidence in the San Ti Ren to this degree, and that they are the salvation of humanity, even though they described humans as insects and were the cause of the death of her daughter and her lover. Another disadvantage is that there are bad and very weak triangle love with no emotional addition to the series and very repeatative stories. As for the end of the first part to say the least, it is very unconvincing and bad and did not motivate me at all for the second part.
1	I can appreciate that a new television series cannot just instantaneously jump in to their storyline without providing their viewing audience with sufficient background information on the main characters. There are three (3) new rookies who are officers in training, Jackson West (Titus Makin Jr.), Angela Lopez (Alyssa Diaz), and the series main star John Nolan (Nathan Fillion). Each rookie is assigned a more experienced training officer while these rookies are being tested out in the field. As for this first episode, it may start off just a tad slow as we get to know the three (3) rookies but the action heats up in the latter half of the series opener. As with any cop show there are lots of bad dudes with guns, crimes committed and you can expect the good guys to generally get the upper hand on the bad guys.I did not see any Emmy award winning performances but I will say the series is both unrealistic and a whole lot of hokey at the same time. I am optimistic as the series progresses that the show will be more about the variety of its characters than the crimes being committed. For this reason I rate the series a 7 out of 10 and worth a watch for characters being portrayed.
0	"Yes it's Fallout, yes the visuals are great, yes they got the theme almost right... but come on, like every series in the last 10 years this one also has horrible writers, cliches, pre-made dialogues, scenes that are copypasted from other shows, etc etc.It gets annoying. The first Lucy scene opens up with the stupid-plot written all over it. Plot holes, logical things that nobody does because it would break the super thin credibility they want to create with the story. Yayy external visitors! But they all smell, they look bad, their manners are questionable. Nobody raise a question, but then the girl finds out they got radiation on them. So... nobody did a check before? They all had their pipboys on, were they all broken?This is the disney version of fallout, where bad guys are extremely recognisable by the audience so they can scream ""oh nooo watch oooout!"" But I'm too old for this stuff, and that's why I liked the plot in the games: it wasn't straight black and white, it wasn't predictable, it was gritty and adult and always looking in the shades of grey.Modern streaming shows are all like this, and I can't stomach them anymore."
2	Was honestly so suprised as how good this turned out.Even if you dont play the games, even if you have no idea what fallout is, you can still enjoy this series.There are alot of elements from the game and other video game cliches thrown in, that if youve played the games, youll get. But even if you havent played a single fallout game, you can still totally enjoy this series.Great acting, good story, good dialogue, good visuals.Unlike other game adaptations, Halo comes to mind, which was a complete tragedy, Fallout doesnt disappoint.All of these new high quality shows seem to be coming out of prime too, also enjoying watching netflix burn.
1	"The Rookie, the series that introduced us to John Nolan, masterfully portrayed by Nathan Fillion, began its journey with two seasons that captured viewers' attention for their freshness and the magnetic presence of their protagonist. Unfortunately, the third season has undergone a change in tone that, in my personal opinion, has negatively impacted the overall quality of the series.The first two seasons of ""The Rookie"" stood out for their solid storytelling, endearing characters, and the unparalleled charisma of Nathan Fillion. Fillion once again showcased his acting prowess in bringing John Nolan to life, allowing the series to shine and carve out a special place in the hearts of viewers. The on-screen chemistry between Fillion and the rest of the cast was palpable, contributing significantly to the series' success.However, my opinion of the third season differs significantly. The shift towards ""identity politics"" has ruined the viewing experience. I feel that ideological themes have been forced into the plot at the expense of narrative coherence. The series has lost the balance that made it special, deviating from the original police intrigues that characterized it.In my view, Nathan Fillion remains a cornerstone of ""The Rookie."" His performance continues to be exceptional, and his dedication to the character of John Nolan is undeniable. However, even Fillion's talent cannot mask the issues in the third season that have affected the overall quality of the series."
0	I was 2 episodes in and I was so close to switching off, I got to episode 5 and finally something happens, I'm thinking here we go it will get better now, but I'm now 7 episodes in and it's still arguably the most boring show I've ever seen, nothing happens, they just constantly talk and talk and talk about aliens coming, but they are 400 years away, well I wish they could turn up and get rid of most of the cast and especially the writers, how can they justify making something so boring?I only watched this because it has Liam Cunningham and Eiza Gonzales but not even they can save it.What an absolute waste.I'd rather be a bug than watch any more of this rubbish.
1	I was looking forward to this but after watching half of the pilot I was starting to wonder how everyone else is giving this 10 stars? I finished and read some online reviews and the endless praising is unwarranted. The Netflix series Marco Polo had one of the highest production costs for it's first season and I was hoping for the same quality here, sadly that's not the case.The writing is simple which is to be expected as it's mostly English subtitles. The musical score is abysmal, the usual background tension drums when anything new or a serious scene is presented. It actually takes away from the scene instead of enhances it. In good television background music goes mostly unnoticed, here it gets annoyingly bad.There are loads of characters which is fine and this pilot is mostly building the world and setting the stage. It's not anything that's out of the ordinary, absolutely amazing storytelling here.The action is minimal and CGI is used to showcase crowd scenes and overhead drone shots.It's 6/10 for the pilot. Maybe a few more shows it'll get better. It's definitely not Marco Polo quality, although it's good enough to keep watching. Perhaps after years of garbage television everyone is just overly excited to watch something decent.
2	First of all this has got nothing to do with any cute reindeers! The reindeer of the title refers to the pet name stalker Martha gives barman and aspiring comedian Donny when she goes into his pub upset one night and he gives her a cup of tea on the house. It's a kind gesture he will live to regret.I started to watch this following positive reviews and word of mouth and I guarantee that once you start you won't stop until it's finished.Richard Gadd created, wrote and stars in it as Donny and it's based on some of his own experiences. He is a phenomenal talent.Jessica Gunning is terrific as the unhinged Martha who becomes obsessed with Donny and infiltrates every inch of his life. It's like Fatal Attraction on speed!But there is another story going on, one of sexual abuse which Donny suffers at the hands of someone else. An episode is dedicated to showing this and it's not an easy watch.There is a scene near the end of the series where Donny breaks down on stage and decides to bear his soul to the audience. It is one of the most incredible pieces of acting you are likely to see. I'll be very surprised if this doesn't pick up awards.
2	Season 8 is a joke, we can't subtle for it, we want George Martin to write us an ending and we want it visualized not on one of his novels. With this season I truly must change my 10/10 to 6/10 because D&D deserve no more
0	All characters in this season deserve better and the writers should face the breath of a dragon. Complete rushed trash of a season, even worse series finale! This might be the worse series finale in television history. 7 great seasons flushed down the toilet by this steaming pile of garbage of a season. This finale was Incoherent and destroyed every characters story. HBO should be ashamed of putting out this garbage
0	Have watched Greys from season 1, and had always been entertained by it, but it's gone downhill big time in the recent seasons. Like everything else that comes out of Hollywood these days, the PC agenda has now taken root within Greys Anatomy, and it's been ruined as a result. We've now stopped watching altogether. So long.
0	The dialogue is terrible, it's child like and forced. The cinematography is the only reason for the 3 stars. Watching this takes effort, you have to really like something so boring. It is not for anyone who isn't into the genre and even then there are way better examples of film noir that are entirely more engaging and enjoyable. It's definitely not a 7.9 in my opinion when there are so many other movies in that review status that are so much better. If you are looking for a time waster to look at some decent ish scenery of Italy and enjoy that period the by all means watch this but if not you will be wishing for the time back.
2	I started season one and I wasn't sure where this show was going to go. But now I am hooked on season two. Good cops trying to do the right things.
1	Surprisingly this show is still going. Watch the first 5 seasons and cut it off
1	The beginning is great. But the plot doesn't make any sense as the show continues. Poor writing. I didn't read the book, so I don't now if it's d&d's fault (again) or if the books are trash.The characters are not very catchy. Their actions are not always consistent. Graphics and CGI are not state of the art. Not bad bad but not good as well.I will watch the second season anyway because I want to know what will happen next. As you can see the story is interesting even if parts of it are dumb.But what show isn't? GoT S 1 - 4 isn't, ok. Breaking Bad isn't... but HotD is dumb and I will watch it anyway.
1	In each new episode, there is a new batch of random conversations between the characters. Only in the last five minutes of the series does any action take place. This leaves you hooked for the following episodes, but in the next episodes there will be the same narrative structure:More conversations between the characters and poor on-screen action in the last few minutes.I've already watched the first seven episodes and any rating that was made close to the series' release date should be redone.I believe that the only episode in which there will really be overwhelming action will be the last.
2	With Nathan Fillion that's always a plus.The series is good, it's enjoyable to watch and binge, comical scenes a la Castle, good actors and dynamic it's obvious they're having fun in filming.I'd lose the hyping pop music during the morning briefings scenes it's terribly cringy, but that's easy to endure with all the perks this show has - still terrible lel.They work the angle of humanizing the stuff that a human being goes through when working as a cop but not too much which is good as this show isn't meant for being a complete drama in all it's well balanced!Go and watch it ^^
1	What a pleasant surprise. I don't think I've seen a videogame adaptation that just gets the source material like this one. The tone, the world, the characters, this isn't just a show based on Fallout, this IS Fallout. The writing, however, can be hit or miss. The show definitely sticks closer to Bethesda's style of writing with its reliance on flashy high-concept setpieces with little depth to them. It makes the show enjoyable, if a bit repetitive, but ultimately a bit shallow. It also does that annoying thing a lot of bad shows do where there's no sense of geography and the characters just sort of teleport to wherever they need to be. The third episode is undeniably the show's lowest point as the show briefly turns into an unfunny sitcom where nothing happens. I wish we could see more of Hank in the beginning to see what kind of person he is. The characters in general feel somewhat underdeveloped, which is disappointing given how much the show focuses on them. Lucy's arc is sweet even though she comes across as a bit too childish at times, The Ghoul is charismatic as hell and watching his transformation from an idealist who believes in the American dream into a bitter and cynical nihilist is fascinating. Maximus is a great character to represent the Brotherhood because of how much he doesn't fit their ideals. He's a sociopath but instead of being a calculating manipulator he's an incompetent buffoon who's bad at pretty much everything he does, what a fascinating character. Ther whole thing feels a bit like a hyper-violent saturday morning cartoon. The show, however, has plenty of great moments, such as the whole Vault 4 subplot which nicely subverts your expectations, feels like a sidequest in New Vegas. In the second half after a couple of filler episodes the show finally decides to become good again and the ending is just firing on all cilinders. The snake oil salesman might be one of my favorite background characters ever. Can't wait for season 2.
2	"This is a good show and has held my interest though it's a bit slow at times and over-wrought with ritual and the relentless threat of suicide. It's like if you spill a cup of coffee you may as well plunge a knife into your gut because you've forever shamed yourself, your entire family and any pets you may have.The character of John Blackthorne who was a hero in the books and the 1980 TV Miniseries has been re-written for the 2020s where we can't have a straight white male being a hero. So he's mainly just a bumbling fool getting by on good luck and the real hero in this one is Mariko, our strong female lead with samurai skillz who is ""ice"" according to her husband. She's not always likable but she's a compelling character acted well.Hiroyuki Sanada (Toranaga) does his usual exceptional acting job and overall this is a great cast playing roles to near perfection. The sets and CGI aerial shots of 1600s Japanese cities are really amazing.There's a lot to like in this series but it also drags at times with the rituals and the attempted tension builds around whether someone will or won't actually commit seppuku, it just gets old after a while. How about an actual battle? It would be nice after all this talk of Blackthorne's cannon tactics. Maybe in episode 10, the only one I haven't yet seen."
2	The love interest for Nathan is way too young. She could be his granddaughter. Please...they look foolish.
0	Last chapters have been a complete disaster for me, to see how they have destroyed everything that was built for 8 years is demeaning. It is as if they got bored suddenly and decided to just dropped the house of cards, let's end this now and we couldn't care less. It's incredible how the producers couldn't came up for something more credible for the audience, I think at this stage we don't care any more of the original story, what we need is a good closure and I think it is absolutely lacking at this moment. I have dropped my rating from 10 to 1.
2	Last Season was disappointing, it shouldn't be top rated series that would be injustice to BREAKING BAD, the writers should learn from the writers of BB not a dull moment from beginning to end(especially the ending), seems like i wasted my time these 9 years during watching the show( especially waiting 2 years for last and the least season)...
0	It was all good until we reached the Final season And the twist at the last episode was very bad like really all what jon does he gets back to the freaking nights watch and dany is the mad queen for gods sake what the helllllllll hbo that's a very bad season We deserve better Ending
1	"For a long while now I've considered this show my favorite series. Season 1-7 were wonderful, full of epic cinematic scenes, inspired acting, and fantastic writing. Season 8 on the other hand, while still possessing the cinematic and acting (for the most part), severely lacks in the writing department. Dan and Dave seemed to have gotten the Disney project and said, ""Game of Thrones who, eh just pump something out quick they'll watch it anyway"". Honestly I would have been okay with the decisions made had there been more story as to why and less foreshadowing and gaps."
0	"I feel sorry for Nathan Fillion. He played an epic character in an epic TV show (Castle) for seven, long terrific years. But now he is just a clown doing clown things on a clown TV show. They killed his acting career. He deserved better than this. He once played an amazing detective and crime novelist who worked side by side with the woman that he fell in love with at first sight. But now he plays a boring woke guy doing boring things with other boring characters. They literally could have made him the only character of a TV show where all he does is wake up, brush his teeth, go to work, and then go home only to have bad nightmares all night. And that would be more interesting than watching him play as this John Nolan character who was once an interesting cop but is in no way interesting anymore. I mean 10 years from now, people will still remember the name ""Richard Castle"". But no one is going to know who the hell ""John Nolan"" is or even care.Yes, I will admit that I was angry and disgusted with the first five or six episodes of S03 because it was nonstop identity politics. But after the fifth or sixth episode, they stopped with that rhetoric. The problem with the show now is that it is completely boring and definitely not worth watching. And it has been so, so bad for the entire S03, that there is just no way that they can recover from it and save the show and make it good again. Just ""filler"" material of these actors standing, walking, or sitting in their cruisers smiling, laughing, and talking. I'd rather watch grass grow or paint dry. The writers and director completely dropped the ball after S02. I can't see this TV show getting a fourth season, and even if it does, it doesn't change the fact that it should have been cancelled immediately."
1	I never watch series on TV but started watching the Rookie, the premise was great and the first 3 series I enjoyed. But the buffoonery in series 4 is ridiculous. People wandering around the police station, helicopters getting stolen for joyrides and some of the characters are out of bad B movies. A big let down!!!
1	"After watched ""3 Body Problem"" and ""The Wandering Earth"". I have a big question: Why a civilization advanced as 3 body do not move their planet out of the chaotic 3 body system like we did in ""The Wandering Earth"" to escape dying sun, and find a single star system and enjoy long stable time. The 3-body civilization would not have to reveal themselives to earth and perfectly sovled the 3-body system chaotic problem and remain silent for dark forest law. I guess this is the requirements of the story and what's the difference compared to ""The Wandering Earth"" if 3 body civilization just move the planet."
0	Good show with a new prospective of law enforcer but is bad liberal propaganda women looks macho like a men with an attitude ....The men are weak or better old with gilts syndromes and all the stereotypes
0	First of all i think nathan fillion is great in everything he does only reason its not a 1 in my book and the only reason im still watching even though im a die hard crime show addict. the show just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. everyone treats each other like garbage all episode every episode and it just leaves you feeling rotten at the end of almost every one. there are VERY few feel good moments you should expect from a cop show when and where they catch the bad guys and save the day. whats strange is the show seems like its trying to be somewhat realistic... the lousy way the cops treat each other and the public they certainly nailed on the head ... its not an over the top hawaii five o or other gun toting superhero cops show. yet theyre getting into sometimes two shootouts in a DAY when that kinda stuff takes you out of duty for weeks or months at a time. most police officers never even DRAW their weapons in their entire careers let alone get into a shootout. i guess rookies just dont have to learn or do paperwork either anymore. stuff this over the top wouldnt even happen in the late 20th century gang ridden crack epidemic los angeles let alone today. unrealistic, feelsbadman, and overall ludicrous. man i really must like fillion cuz 4/10 seems to be pushing it.
0	GoT isn't same anymore since the finale of season 6, too much Fan-service nowadays, ruined Tyrion, Varys, and killed off Littlefinger, and don't get me started on butchering of Night King/walkers stroryline (storyline they've been building up for years). Almost every Fan-favorite Characters are Plot Armoured. Characters Are Teleporting here to there. There isn't any tension nor shock events like in Starting seasons. I felt like I'm watching some random Superhero movie. They've hyped BoW as it would be more shocking than Red wedding. Someone tell them that There's difference between Creating Shock events with Writting brilliance and create forced shock events just to satisfy masses without caring about Plots. #BringGGRMBackOnShow
0	When I saw the trailer I was like oh wow this looks amazing! We're gonna see an alien invasion and time travel, things that will blow my mind and make me think. But instead what I saw was an unimaginably boring 8 episodes with no action except for a few minutes in one episode. No aliens, no action, nothing that made me think real hard or that boggled my mind. I would have turned it off long time ago but someone else wanted to watch it so it was on and I just couldn't believe how boring it was. Almost as boring was watching paint dry, no joke. Now I don't anything about the book, I only know what I saw in the trailer and whoever put that trailer together is a incredible because he took the dullest most boring show I've ever seen and made it look amazing.I am so so disappointed. What was this? What was the point?I hope there is never another awful show like this again.But for those who enjoyed it, I'm happy for you.
1	I'm not one to follow a series as it is released. Mainly because of my impatience as a viewer. I get so involved, that I have to fuel the fire all at once. Eight years in the making, the suspense was. Boy, let me tell you, the imagination was surpassed ten fold when I actually started the series. It was a bit slow to begin with, though once it took flight, it soared. The writing, character development, portrayal, and the wonder. Astonishing. Unfortunately, the series stumbled, then tripped. The swan dive was horrifying. Such potential ripped from the very soul of the once beautiful masterpiece. With no effort really. All by just the last two episodes. It pains me to have to leave such a terrible review. A 6/10 is actually a bit courteous. I feel sorry for those that followed from day one with such patience. Maybe reading the books will make something better.
0	So many have reviewed this so I don't have to go on and on about the entire premise. I do have to say, because I really think it should be said, that there is so much potential here, but it's ruined. The lighting, the directing, the cinematography, the production value, the wardrobe, all so well done. It's beautiful...So why only four stars? It's filled with so many gratuitous sex scenes. Any way you like it: Gay, Lesbian, bi, Straight, Incestuous, sex while murdering... the list goes on and on. I really like sex. I do! I like it in movies and I like it in shows, but this is ridiculous. Almost none of it drives the story. None of it is really necessary at all, but sometimes it's nice to have a nice tasteful love scene. In this case it's a ploy to get ratings. It appears to have worked! My next complaint is about something that they could not have changed as it is part of the story from the books, but this is my review and I can give my opinion (shared by many.) They kill every character that you care about. Then, they introduce some new characters for you to like, and they kill them off. The bad guy wins. That is what they are trying to convey. It may be their prerogative to convey it, but I don't have to watch it. So I don't. I stopped watching. I just couldn't take it any more.The sad part is that there is so much good in this series. I really like the concept of the White Walkers. I like their take on dragons. The whole aesthetic is so well done. The world they have created is quite breathtaking. I just wish I could bring myself to watch it. The story just stinks. Oh well, there are plenty of people that like it so this is just one man's opinion.
1	I've never read the book or seen 'The Talented Mr Ripley', or any other adaptation, so unlike most reviewers was not familiar with the story. The photography was great although I find filming in monochrome a tad pretentious in an attempt to be 'arty'. Much of the direction appeared to be a homage to Hitchcock and was none the worse for that.I liked the controlled perfomance by Andrew Scott as Tom Ripley, playing the serial killer perfectly and thought all the cast did a fine job. I particularly liked the superior expression on the face of the all knowing cat.So, this is a fine series and I will now watch some different versions to make a comparison. I would have given this a nine, but have to dock a couple of points for not filming the gorgeous Italian scenery in colour.
1	Certain things just happened for dramatic effect, the boat scene made me roll my eyes harder than ever. You tell me that after he hits Greenleaf somehow he falls overboard, gets hit in the head, the boat leaves and manages to make it out alive? Let's not mention his fear of water, what happened to that?Also the sloppy killing, he probably isn't a killer but this series made everyone look stupid.Marge going from smart, suspicious, relentless to soft, repentful and friendly towards Tom. I kept waiting for Marge to twist the story, have a secret plan to reveal what Tom really is, but no.Anyway.
0	The show itself is a bit of a feel-good series about a 40-year old man turned cop who gets to (of course) bang a 28 year old from training academy.Naturally the 40 year old is considerate, moral and wise man...... not like 99.9% of the 40 year old divorced men who are generally out of shape, bitter and depressed.The stories are of course typical police stories, but this show sees a lot of super-unrealistic gun-fights and unrealistic situations.
2	An excellent series in all its aspects, until it reaches a disappointing and cruelly hurtful ending. What a bad way to end what could have been the most successful series of all time, and all because the producers were offered more money to do other things. In short, what could have been the best series of all time, with the worst ending of all time. Extremely cruel !!
2	When I checked the rating of this show. I was content, it reflects my view of the show as well.When I read some of the (negative) reviews, I was surprised.Sure, I haven't read the book. So I don't know if this is a perfect adaption.But on it's own it stands out as a House of Cards-style show that keeps you locked in from beginning to end of each episode.The intricacies of japanese politics, the clash and influence of outside religion and cultures, man.. it's just delicious to consume.If you're looking for a show that is packed with action and fighting. This is not the show.If you're looking for a show that makes you want to live in this japanese era, while also having moments of fun and action, don't miss out!
0	What a huge disappointment to see an incredible, multilayered series - years in the making - crippled by simplistic writing in its final seasons, including a finale that may be the dumbest of all time. It makes Donald Trump's thought process seem complex. Find a different series to binge - don't waste your time with this total loser.
0	Dear Dan and Dave,I have long been a huge fan and an avid supporter of Game of Thrones all the way since Season 1, granted I regretfully have not had the joys of reading any of the wonderful George RR Martins books. I have, however spent hundreds of hours exploring the Game of Thrones lore, history of Westeros, fan theories, detailed interviews and everything in-between - It's fair to say I'm a more passion fan than most.I am no Hollywood writer - or in fact any writer for that matter - but I believe I share the opinion of so many GoT fans. I want to start off by saying thank you. Thank you to the visual effects crew, stunt co-ordinators, body doubles, extras, set designers, costume designers, camera men, George RR Martin, directors, the brilliant actors and so many other people behind the scenes of this once all-time great show - Not only have we the fans been incredibly let down, but the people who have put their physical blood, sweat and tears into the show have also had their beautiful hard work defiled.I could go into incredible detail about all the things wrong with this season, some notable events: Jon being exiled for killing Danny who murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent people, Jon's heritage being seemingly not important, the woeful execution of Danny going mad, Bran being king even though he didn't do anything at all, Drogon flying off into the 'sunset', Rhaegal being killed, missing the reaction of Sansa and Arya's when Jon revealed his real parents and most of all for me, no one sticking up for Jon in the meeting with all the powerful lords... He literally killed the woman he loved and saved countless lives in the process and he gets nothing in return, its shameful.With the holes in the show - and there as so many - I think it's a pathetic excuse of an ending. HBO wanted 10 seasons, but foolishly Dan Weiss and David Benioff decided they had enough, they wanted to wrap the show up so they could make mountains of money butchering yet another beloved franchise (Star Wars). I understand that not everything deserves a happy and perfect ending, nor can you please everyone. However, we spent nearly a decade following these wonderful characters, watching them develop and intelligently interact with each other since season 1. The ending to this show will never be forgotten, for the wrong reasons unfortunately. I hope Dan and David come out and apologise to the fans, we are the people that kept the show running, without the fans support there would have been no Game of Thrones on TV at all.The characters deserved better. The whole crew deserved better. The fans deserved better. George deserved better.Regards, A Game of Thrones fanOriginally posted by channelsergeant on Game of Thrones S08E06
2	And book readers, if books are so superior then why every single time you watch and whine? Let dumb adaptations get dumb appreciation.This series isn't without its faults but acting, production, cinematography, sound design is all done great except some janky VFX here and there. Ramin Djwadi's music is good but not as impactful as Westworld and Game of thrones.Some scenes could've been better in chopping room and some things are just exposition. So don't expect a series like Dark. But it's not a 3 or 4 or even 6 for that matter. It's entertaining. Slow burn at times. Acted very well and dialogues are for the most part really well done.Some sequences are executed extremely well and few characters are written well enough to become memorable as well.Here's to the hopeful second season which I can't wait for.
1	During quarantine I decided to binge watch Grey's from season 1 to remind myself why I used to love it. When I reached season 11, I realized that's when it started to annoy me. Amelia Shepard is the most obnoxious character ever while Maggie is the most annoying. And just how many sisters can Meredith possibly have? Kind of a stupid premise. And I would have slapped Bailey senseless years ago. I just lost interest.
2	I loved watching the first two seasons. The acting and storytelling was perfect but then we have season 3. As of writing this, I have watched 6 or 7 episodes of season 3 and it just keeps getting worse. I believe that racism is a problem but the character portrayed by Brandon Routh is a one dimensional caricature of a stereotypical white male racist cop. Whoever decided that Brandon Routh should play this caricature should have been fired on the spot. The only constantly good thing is Nathan Fillion's character, John Nolan and he is the only reason I'll keep watching this show. Currently there are only 4 seasons available on Netflix in my country and reading some of the other reviews on here. I think I'm gonna need a bottle or two of hard liquor to help me finish watching the show. It's sad that they ruined such an amazing show.
2	This series - hard to believe it's over a decade old! It's one of the greatest of all times. Without giving much away, the latter season felt a bit rushed, but certainly there are no loose ends in this unforgettable medieval fantasy series. The warring factions are captivating and all have their own vibe. The original and screenplay writers do a great job of bringing the vibrant universe to life. The acting and direction are top notch. The film score is absolutely cinematic and helps set the scene. The set design and costumes are perfect and all seem real. If you've been living under a rock, it's time to watch this show!
2	TLDR: The show is awesome. The music, costuming, and sets are all top notch. The cinematography is breathtaking, the acting: stupendous. The writers have done VERY well with what they were clearly told to do: squeeze a 428,000 word epic into six, one-hour long TV episodes. They did very well and delivered a fantastic Cliffs Notes version of the novel. If the showrunner(s) had allowed them to tell the entire story, I would have given this a 10 instead of an 8.I read Shogun, by James Clavell, because it came highly recommended and because I considered it a challenge: I am not used to reading books that are quite that long. I fell in love with it. It is such a beautiful love letter from a Westerner to Japan. I just wish the show had taken on the monumental task of telling the entire story. One of the reasons the book is so long is that it takes quite a long time for a Westerner to learn the ins and outs of a culture as complicated and nuanced as feudal Japan. It would have been so wonderful to see the entire novel in its rich fullness played out with the level of excellence achieved in this show.
0	Netflix succeeded again in taking those marvelous ideas in the original book, butchered and glued it into a joke.The visual effects team pay unnecessary attention to things like the countdown numbers sparking. Totally screwed up those plots that are frightening by their simplicity. A VLCC cut up like a soap box.And yeah, too many soap opera ingredients are added, too. Huge portion of the show turned up to be some romantic relationship story with colleagues, alteregos (they just have this need to turn a single person into a couple of morons fing with each other) and even the enemies. The power of conflict between the ETO and the human society is greatly dimished, which was the whole point. Writers are just trapped in a mindset of rendering CPC as savage, and keep adding actors whose whole purpose is to be diversity.
1	Not well spent money $20 million per episode.Huge budget spent on special effects that are sometimes absolutely brilliant but sometimes look like bad sci-fi from the 90s. I don't get a luxurious feeling when I see this series that cost so much to make. It feels more like Emmerdale on steroids or like a bad British crime series.It's not bad but not $20 million per episode good.The series really balances from being an ok Sci-fi to being a single big flop. It's mostly the British feel over the whole production that bothers me. The first 8 episodes haven't been particularly tense either. Most messy and confusing.
2	Grey's was the best show on TV. I laughed, I cried and I loved every episode. Losing Yang was hard. She was amazing. Then they made us hate Derek before they killed him off. Alex leaving was too much. I understand that Justin wanted to leave and I'm guessing that he had things going on in his personal life which made his exit so sudden. I understand that the writers did their best with what they had. I am glad he got a happy ending but Alex would never have done that to Jo. Never. Losing Alex was the last straw for me. Yes, I'm still watching but it's now just a shadow of a, show I used to love.
0	Besides the bad characters. The entire premise is dumb. There is no way life let alone an advanced civilization could evolve under such chaotic and destructive conditions Also, why would an advanced civilization that had developed quantum tech and built thousands of spaceships not be able to figure out how to travel faster than light? Also, why would they need to conquer a planet that already has a civilization on it, when even our primitive civilization has been able to detect hundreds of exo-planets that could be suitable for colonization? Another thing is why are the scientist characters so unscientific? They hang around bars all the time and put possible mind controlling helmets on without a second thought? Also, how could an advanced civilization not understand such a basic thing as metaphor in a children's story? D & D strike out again.
1	"I have watched every episode of Grey's. I don't believe I have ever reviewed it. It has been an excellent series, as can be noted by its longevity. However, this year, I suddenly was bored by the same old characters and everybody having problems. Of course, there is the obligatory surprise pregnancy - again. Also, ""Meredith Grey,"" (Ellen Pompeo) is 50 years old and it is getting kind of absurd to have her acting like a 20-something, which is what she does. If the writers would work on that one thing - making Meredith a mature adult - it would help me keep my interest in this series. I have nothing against the May-December romance she has going with the young doctor, it's just her mannerisms and sometimes clothing that are over the top. I don't know if I am going to last the entire season unless something gets shaken up and freshened up in some way."
1	"Once again, I think those critics have ""binged"" the series. Whereas, most of us civilians only got to see the pilot. But, I've still come to the same consensus. Nathan is carrying this show -- if you watch this mediocre show, it's just for him. He's got no support -- everyone is angry with everyone, everyone sends everyone ""mixed signals"". This is just Quantico packaged in an LAPD setting. I'll give it more time, but so far this is all I have to say -- if you like Nathan, keep watching. If you're new to his work...this is not him at his best, don't waste your time. Go watch reruns of Firefly (Serenity) or Castle instead...much better. (so far)"
0	Who the hell came up with this? Seriously horrible writing and acting...I've seen better shows on the CW
1	But after the plane crash - everything went down hill. When they killed off Shepard it got worse. I stopped watching it after.
0	My wife stopped watching the series midway because she felt it was like a teenage drama, with reactions and actions possibly influenced by hormonal imbalances. But I continued after having 2-3 more drinks. Additionally, the five friends in the series share the common background of attending Oxford, which seems to suggest that only bright minds come from there, a notion rarely seen in reality. The series is so boring; it does not appeal to any science-loving mind nor the general public. It seems like a poorly written series, no doubt crafted by a team also responsible for the worst season of GOT when they faced writing without any book available. Extra 2 stars just for the concept borrowed from the book. Now, I planing to buy the translated version of the book instead and experience its true content.
2	"Seasons 1-4 10/10. Seasons 5-6 9/10 Season 7 8/10 Season 8 3/10.Overall that gives the average of 8.6/10 so it should be 9, but I'll give it 8 because writing of Season 8 leaves show with absolutely no rewatch value.Don't know what to say besides I am very disappointed, and the infamous expression ""subverting expectations"" will probably be what we will remember from this show."
0	But that's about it.I love Andrew Scott but he is too old for this series and doesn't even look like Dickie, which makes the plot even more thinner.I never read the book but I watched the Talented Mr. Ripley movie and compared to that, this series is a letdown despite the total length of 8 episodes and the beautiful set pieces.First of all, despite its length, I never got the chemistry between Dickie and Tom. They never became best friends and Dickie is just... so bland (especially compared to the character played by Jude Law). The highly anticipated boat scene became wtf for me for its sheer stupidity. Maybe if the point was to show how stupid and naive Dickie was, then it worked 100%.Also, there is just some unrealistic / bad followed up scenes. Like Tom got super wet but then he appeared to be very dry in the next scene, or the clean up scenes where you would have thought there would be some implication considering how awful Tom is at cleaning up his own mess, but it never happened.Don't know... I guess I was expecting something more but Tom appeared to win because the writer wrote him to win, not because of his own wit (much like the movie).Oh, music is really good though. And the cat.
2	"At first I thought ""no please, not another cop show"" and I wasn't sure about Nathan Fillion as a cop. But I must say, the directing is spot on, and the writing is refreshing - especially the relationships of the rookies and their T.O's, their relationship with each other, the conflicts they have to deal with, and the use/views of the body cams. Also surprisingly, Fillion is perfect for this part and nails his role, and all other actors were perfectly cast and also are great in their roles. I especially appreciate seeing the various parts of L.A. and the different people/conflicts the LAPD has to deal with - outside and within the force. So far so good, let's hope the writing progresses as good at the pilot was throughout the season. A well deserved 8/10 from me.EDIT: 4/2019 - upped my score from 8 to 9/10... the writing has vastly improved; more realistic (and original) drama, and much less cliched cheese. Keep it up guys!"
0	Started out great, but the last few years ruined the show with radical leftist ideology.Not for my family.
2	I do not understand why people didn't like the end.. It is the most logical end. The series never deceive.
0	Loved the show till Season 8. What a bad ending and poorly written.
1	"Everything was going amazingly until they introduced the character of Bailey Nune, an utter Mary Sue. They way they forceful highlight her as ""I can do everything"" female character in every episode she is showing up is so utterly annoying. It's like this vegan person who needs to tell everyone that he/she is vegan.Before Bailey Nune: 9/10 After Bailey Nune: 3/10I'm literally stressing out if it's worth watching given episode, so my time isn't ruined by her cringe character.Just stop people. Bailey Nune is a forced, and absurd character."
1	As someone who has played FO1, 2, 3, and New Vegas, they nailed the tone and world building.As someone who likes actually good writing, this show fell flat on its face. Hard.Oddly enough, the storytelling here was relatively solid. Good characterization. The tone, as mentioned. A nice blend of cartoonish dark humor and grit.But in a rare twist of modern literature, it's the plot that is a problem. The plot became so nonsensical by the end that it wrecked the first half of the series.First, the reveal of how Vault 31/32/33 operate means that Hank must have known of the destruction of 32. Yet he let in the raiders.Second, Moldaver and Hank had history, and he STILL let in the raiders.Third, the show simply handwaves how Moldaver, who had a massive falling out with Vault Tech, somehow survived 200 years.Fourth, Hank nuked - NUKED - a whole city because his wife ran away? A hard pill to swallow... and a bridge to far when you remember he's been in cryo for 200 years and underground his whole life. Snap! Nuke!There plot issues that exist after you sit and think about it. And then there's issues that make you stop in the middle of the show and make you rewatch the foundational pieces to make sure you didn't miss something.Fallout is squarely in the latter category.While there is enough in the show to enjoy the journey, it wants to tell a cohesive story, and it does not. It's not a series of side quests. That brings the show way down in my book.If you can overlook foundational concerns like this, you'll enjoy the show.
2	My husband and I look forward to The Rookie each week. Nathan Fillion is our favorite actor, he is what brought us to watch.
0	This was NOT the first time I turned off an episode of GA out of disgust. Considering what individuals of the same political philosophy did to Seattle, Portland, and other cities, it takes real balls to criticize and lecture on the scale of this series. I'll stop there, before I'm deemed to be competing with the obnoxious persons behind this show.
1	So I get it, its just one of these series you must like , rate 10 stars and speak with everyone how clever it is and how much you love it,, what we call a hypeWell its not bad either, its ok and if you havnt seen it and want to read reviews, go for the ones that rated with 3- 7 points because they are honest and truly, the rest just just want to manipulate the ratingsystemIts amazing slow in the beginning, also a bit hard to follow but it will speed up and the pieces will fit toghetter, the story is strange and the idea a bit to crazy , but something make you to keep watching it , so its ok but I will never see it again and not sure I manage next season.
0	"Almost 90% of this 10-plus hour series was just boring melodramatics and lame nonsense proverbs. Even if you condensed just the best and pertinent parts from all ten episodes, you'd still barely have an enjoyable and fulfilling movie. There would still be more plot holes than bad haircuts and lame dialogue combined.Then to make matters worse, they finish the series off ""explaining"" how the battle was won, instead of showing anything. No big battle, nothing. I was waiting the entire series to see this big revenge war, and all I get is this anticlimactic speech. So in other words, there' too much blah blah, many beautiful scenes that offer zero to little plot advancement, and tons of useless half-explained backstories that added nothing but melodramatics to the already going-nowhere story.I'm baffled how this series is rated so high. Never mind all the fake 10/10 new account reviews, but even on RT - 99% by the critics?! Like seriously, are they that bored and easily amused and have that much time to waste with no reward for the viewers investment? By far this is the most boring, waste of budget and overrated series I have ever seen, and I've seen many flops. It's a very generous 1/10 all going to production values, and some decent cinematography - with the exception of the overly dark/night scenes, where I guess they couldn't find power outlets to plug some set lights on."
2	A fantastic show through two seasons. Third season is struggling to maintain the momentum though, but I wouldn't miss it anyway.
0	"Seasons 1 and 2 funny (although end of season 2 is over the top with this ridiculous serial killer thing)Season 3 overwhelmingly making use of absurd political concepts (so, the guys of a city area complain about suffering from drug dealers, but it's bad to arrest the dealers because police bad, POC good: ""heads I win tail you lose"", as we say in French - the ""whites"" cops are the bad either the option, doing their job or not doing it)I gave up after 5 episodes in season 3 - writers really need to realize that we are grownups who don't need to be reeducated.It looked very much like soviet fictions meant to ""edificate the masses"" and I felt horribly embarrassed for the comedians."
0	This show used to be in my top 3 favourites of tv shows, and I watch a lot of tv shows! After season 7 I watched the quality slowly decline. Season 8 episode 3 ruined the whole thing for me. I honestly lost all interest in the rest of the show, and this makes me sad, really..
0	First year and half of the next was good. Interesting story with some good comic relief. Fillian is good through out the story.However mid 2nd year, they got woke and turned to crap. Made cops look bad. Then made the public bad, evil, and stupid. Cancelled recordings after 2nd episode of 3rd season. Just too painful to listen to the crap from lazy writers and director.
0	Not for the first time I have tried to get into this show. I don't think a show could be as well respected and talked about favourably as this one is, and I completely see why people would like it.I just can't seem to get into it. Maybe medical dramas aren't my cup of tea, maybe I found the constant rat a tat tat dialogue a bit wearying after a while. Ditto the smug nature of the characters at times.So while I respect good writing, performances, and of course the sheer longevity that that this show has had, I can't say it would rank in my top ten list of shows, or would be one I would invest much time in watching.
0	"Standard Netflix series journey here - starts super intriguing and cool and then turns into complete drivel. The film has an interesting and intruigung concept, but its execution feels off and all over the place. So many ""filller"" scenes with no substance or direction, with characters just making small talk instead of moving the story forwards. There were some very good parts, such as the nano fibres tearing the boat apart, but even with this I was questioning why the scientist and the agency would do something that horrific??? Why not just board the boat and try to stop them by force? Or at least try to?? Didn't think the music was that great either. So my end take is that it could have been a great series if the script was better and the director had a clearer vision. I wouldn't waste your time on this, unless you're curious as to how bad Netflix series can be. Would be stunned if this got a second season. Such a shame."
2	A very well made period piece. Loved the cinematography and the frames. Keeps you right on the edge. A beautiful balance of mystery, acting, and art. The choice of making the entire piece in black and white was interesting but I guess it made the period drama more believable. However, the series should be watched with an open mind as it has been shot in 1960s when things were not digital and communication was quite slow.Background score and the settings go well with the storyline. The scenic urban-scapes, the gorgeous architecture, and portrayal of Italy are some of the other strong points of the series. There are a few subtle loopholes but that are overshadowed by an otherwise must watch master piece.
1	This had a lot of nostalgic elements from the games, it's music and set. I'm sure a lot of gamers like me would appreciate many parts of the world come to life. The main character is alright, she's full of pep and enthusiasm that would fit a vault dweller. But the ghoul is the main highlight of the show, he very quickly steals everyone else's attention, feels like the first few episodes of the Mandalorian.Maximus however, had so much inconsistencies and later on he acts as if he's written by two different people.. Many parts of the series portrays him as very weak then later on acts like an experienced wastelander... then another episode of him acting all weak and stupid again. His inconsistencies like his disappearing branding and all of a sudden his idiocy was contagious enough to even affect the main character - who was naive the first parts of the series, then experienced, then suddenly back to being silly again. Perhaps the writers had rad poisoning. He is basically like Star Wars' Finn. Boring, uninteresting, I even had to google for the correct spelling of his name, that's how memorable he was.Love interests in the entire series had no chemistry, no love and all business. Remove that and it won't affect the story at all.The season ending was kind of everything I'd expect the series to end, but a bit flat.. there was chaos but I sense no excitement at all, even with the Ghoul appearing. Overall I'd give this a 6.5, it's the Ghoul that saved this series to be honest, I'd watch season 2 if it's just him.
0	OK If you are reading this i am guessing you are one of those super fans who can't get enough of Game Of Thrones & like wallowing in your appreciation of this despicable sorry excuse for TV Fantasy drama. As you can tell i am not one of you. Game of Thrones has so many good reviews & such glowing praise as to make me wonder if the whole world has fallen asleep or alternatively hooked up to some matrix-like hive mind channelling this drivel through a tube placed carefully up your backside, can so many people be so wrong? well the answer is Yes obviously. To Critique this show in a sour way is tantamount to treason i am sure but i am British & trust me it is OK to voice your opinion in a negative way despite the whole world wanting to spit venomous bile in your eyes. I have like most of you, watched every episode of it & although you will rant that i have a choice not to watch it or to plainly just go away, i, like a lot of people these days like watching TV shows & be they bad or good it is always good to watch the things that everyone is talking about (and talking about, and talking about) so i carry on in the vain hope that one day i'll switch this show on & something will actually happen but instead i get B grade British actors talking about 'The Wall' or saying things like 'Something awful is coming' or 'Let's shag!' & on & on, talking, more talking & waiting & waiting, always waiting for something to happen, has anyone noticed that nothing has happened in this show for the last 2 seasons? oh but there was a big battle! yes there was except we missed most of it as we were watching the women hiding below talking some more. Oh but there was 'The Wedding' yes there was, 5 minutes of action tabbed on the end of one of those lengthy talky episodes (you know the ones) 'wow so radical, killing off some of the main characters in such a ghastly manner, no one has done that before' Give me strength!! Game of thrones is like a really bad carrot, like the ones you always throw away to get a better one in the grocers, and the viewers are like ageing donkeys continually following it around until you are so accustomed to doing it that you just carry on regardless, yes i am one of them, i've been suckered as well!, i admit it but by always tossing out the promise of dragons i persevered anyway & now i am at a point that i am writing a review about it, not because i like the bloody thing more because i am sick of these endless reviews praising it's 'Boldness', it's 'Genius', it's 'Lord of the Rings-ish-ness.' My god people, what version of Lord of the Rings have you seen? the one i watched was majestic, action packed, sad, uplifting, funny & the real definition of Genius. Not this pile of puss spewing troll bile that passes itself off as fantasy, if anything its more like playboy channel soft core porn than epic fantasy, obviously one of the main reasons its so popular. Of course you will tell your girlfriend/boyfriend your watching it for the breathtaking dramatics or epic storytelling (because of course it has both of those..cough..choke!!) So you will go on watching it telling your friends how amazing it is, how shocked you were by it etc etc but deep down you all know the truth, that this is just a low level generic hybrid of The Red Shoe Diaries, Dr Quinn Medicine Woman & the recent crap Conan movie. In years to come this will be joked about, like in one of those TV Shows that reminisce about the 80's or 90's with a headline like 'How 10 million people COULD be wrong' & you'll sit there & laugh to yourself in a sad 'i wasted my youth' type way, you will finally realise after years of trailing after the carrot that nothing is going to happen in this show, you'll be left with one last talky exposition scene (whilst a battle rages on somewhere else, presumably somewhere they can't take the cameras) everybody will sit round the throne & toast with fine wine & grapes, there will be singing & dancing & orgies (of course) and maybe if we are lucky, one of the dragons might take a dump? Seriously if people don't start waking up soon i worry about the world, i mean Reeves & Fishburne are way too famous now to give a toss so save yourselves. There are much better shows out there to obsess over, much better fantasy books to read, much much better fantasy films to watch & certainly way better porn! but of course if watching evil characters twirl their moustaches & cackling behind peoples backs whilst masturbating over incestuous kin doing the Humpty Dumpty is your kind of thing, there is at least one scene like this every couple of episodes so knock yourself out. oh and of course you will get the promise of dragons just at the moment your thinking about switching off & watching re-runs of Breaking Bad instead... awful TV, watch Lord of the Rings again, that might wake you up my Matrix loving friends. Game of Thrones, enjoy your stay of execution but one day your head is going to be lopped off just like the only good actor in your show... By the way if you are thinking i am a Troll, i'm not, Trolls are fictional beasts that usually turn up in decent fantasy shows along with Goblins & Dragons, all of which do not feature prominently in Game of Thrones!
1	"You would have the best tv show if it wasn't for season 8. Some episodes were amazing like ""rains of castamere"" ""the door"" ""dragon stone"" ""hardhome"" and many more. And then season 8 begun. You built Night King to be soo powerful and you kill him off in one episode with Arya to be an assassin???? And if that wasn't enough you turn dany into a mad queen maybe female Hitler but ok Aegon would save the day. And when the time comes you say ""hey you know what Aegon is a nobody we'll just exile him to castle black and without need for night watch to exist"". The whole Aegon thing building up was for nothing. And then at the ""council"" you discover democracy in a show that was all about conspiracy, murders, stubbing in the back making the finale disproofing what has been done. Good job on disappointing everyone game of thrones."
2	15 seasons in and I am dreading, because sometimes it's just so predictable! Don't do this please?
2	I love this series. I love almost everything in it. It's like, you grow up with the characters, you see how they are doing in their life and you reflect that on your own... It is so amazing to see people like Jackson Avrey or Alex, how they became from little boys, irresponsible and too proud of themselves to big men, responsible, proud and decided to do more. I have been through almost every of my own life in this series and I think that I have learnt a lot.
1	Season 4 was very disappointing, I mean what was that with Tim-Dim & Lucy-Juicy thing!? I mean we get that you want to bring them together as it has been hinted for so long now, but was that (doppelgänger theme) the only way the creators decided to go ahead with?Also, the shoot out in the season finale was not up to The Rookie standard which they have always maintained in previous seasons, I hope season 5 will make us forget the season 4 disappointment.Though season 4 was a mess there were few really nice episodes in it too like in the case of Aaron Thorsen, I am really glad that they finally brought some closure to his friends murder case.Also, I hope the show creators bring the FBI trainee Simone Clark character back again in season 5, she is like a female version of John Nolan. Both in terms of Career decisions & handsomeness ;-)Finally, can't wait for season 5. Hope the show gets back to its original charm again. All the best to the whole team.
2	One of the best series, I've binged. Utter brilliance shown all-round from the actors to the directors, I salute all the crew and cast who have worked tirelessly to put together such a masterclass.
0	So many unanswered questions. Waste of seasons in the past going into depth and MANY things that have nothing to do with the storyline what so ever. The ending seems like it was literally thrown together overnight and highly disappointing. I feel like I've wasted so much of my life on this show, for this last season to be so terrible. Disappointed.
1	Shogun is propably most notable book of late James Cavell. In time of it's publishing it was surprisingly well acceptepted even by japanese, by how well it incaptured this mysterious culture. Then comes this atrocity. Understandably some libertties need to be taken when adapting a book into a movie or tv series, but these choises done here, not only they deviate from the source material, they do it in a fashion that makes absolutely no sense. Like no sense at all. Some conversations are made totally redundant for no reason, for instance when Blackthorne explains Netherlands insurrogance against their rightfull sovereign. In a book and in 80's series it was depicted in a way that made sence. And my biggest grievance is Blackthorne. Who in their right mind thought that dead-eyed ding dong like Cosmo Jarvis was a good choice for the lead role. That's totally inexcusable. That man has zero range, he would be better of playing some football hooligan than a 1600-century pilot, whom by should be one of the better educated people in the world. In the book he has his problems coming adjusted with japanese culture but he actually learns, beacuse he's smart. Not only language but culture. And he learns how to navigate the dangerous waters of japanese in house fighting of 1600-century. Cosmo Jarvis depicts a moron who actually learns few words of japanese but absoluteli insists on being a moron and stuck to his ways. Richard Chamberlain wasn't perfect Blackthorne in 80's series, but at least he could act, Cosmo Jarvis absolutely cannot. People who are giving this one 10/10 must not have actually seen this depiction.
0	"I didn't like the 1999 version at first, but as time went on, I came to love it for the pacing, costumes, performances and scenery (to me, Italy is another character of the story). It has become one of those reliable movies that I rewatch when I can't find anything else to put on.So when I saw this was coming out, I was super excited. I could tell it was gonna be different from the original, and that was fine with me. I figured that the story would be strong enough to keep me interested.When I started the first episode, I loved the b&w. But I quickly realized that there's a lot of mood building by way of single closeup shots - for example an ashtray with a lit cigarette would be held for like 10 seconds or falling water during a shower for just as much time. The use of single camera and centering also became tedious for me. Of course there were times where it worked beautifully, but after a while, I really wanted there to be little bit more movement.I can understand why this movie is getting such high reviews - especially if one hasn't seen Hitchcock. But what Hitchcock had were better performances and tighter pacing. While I love me some Adam Scott, he's too old for the role, and my first thought when Johnny Flynn came on the screen was ""They don't look similar at all - at least Matt Damon's hair could mimic Jude Law's. How's this gonna work?"" And then the performances were really underwhelming. Every actor in this is talented, but the director instructed them to give extremely deadpan performances. Lastly, I was really disappointed in the actor who did Freddie Miles. Philip Seymour Hoffman was such a powerhouse that whoever filled the role in this version needed to bring something to it; I'm not talking about her gender, I'm talking about some sort of dark charisma that repelled and compelled. Can't tell if it was direction, her ability or even the script. Probably all of them.So admittedly, I've only fast forwarded through 3 episodes. I will probably fast forward through the rest of it at some point. Based on the extra time spent on mood in the first 3 episodes, this definitely could have been told in four."
1	Ignore Season's 13-17, and it's good. After the 12th season it went downhill, in my opinion. It's not bad, but should've ended a few seasons ago.
0	The only fact that Scott/Greenleaf/Ripley with only a beard and a wig with long hair tries to deceive the Italian inspector who has seen him 3 or more times, and this works, destroyes the already fragile credibility of the whole structure.Scott is too old and lacks charm. Freddy is incomprehensibly more similar to a woman than to a man and the whole narrative structure suffers from a weak script and a questionable direction.The Americans have many flaws in writing and directing, and one of them is the incredible carelessness in the mise-en-scène.This happens often also in great movies.They simply don't care.
0	The characters are completely unrelated to the original work, the plot is too fast-paced, and there is no shaping of the characters' personalities. All the characters are merely pawns to push the plot forward. Ye Wenjie is a person who is internally wounded and disappointed in humanity. Why would she sleep with different people? American scriptwriters seem unable to understand that there can be emotions other than love between the male and female leads, and they must strengthen the connection between the characters through sexual relations. I suggest that those who have watched the TV series should go read the original work.
1	"First of all I want to say I agree with the reviews about the choice of actors. Why does it always have to be young females (late 20s) who plays leaders of big organisations and departments and brilliant doctors of theoretical physics etc.? Does anyone know how long it takes just to get through the education in university to get the phd degree? And then you need to work many years and publish a lot to become ""someone"" of importance. I'm sure these are supposed to be the most brilliant people on the planet (!) but it's still very unbelievable.Netflix (and others): There are lots of wonderful female actors 40-50+ to play these roles much better and more genuinely.Same goes for the guys mostly.Second, the acting and the personal plot twists are not so interesting, except for Jin's experiences in the game, where she actually develops some insight.However the others' stories seem fleeting and irrelevant. Interesting points fade away (like the numbers seem by one actor in the beginning..).. why? No follow up?Lastly, after the first 3-4 episodes the pace slows down, we now know ""what's coming"" and it gets quite boring with the retrospect parts. I fell asleep actually. I fear this is another one coming to a really bad and unsatisfying ending.. (how can it not?) but will watch the remaining episodes."
0	First I am a gamer. Huge Eldarscrolls fan for years. Huge rpg fan. Love sci-fi.However I will be upfront and say I played a bit of FO3 and thought it was a bit crap to be honest. Horrid interface, lacked good mod support like Oblivion and the endless knives and forks and microwave parts. Oh and it's a personal opinion but I hate the 50s retro sci fi thing.Why do I say this. To be upfront. This has such good reviews I thought I'd put my biases behind me and give it a shotWell where do I startA guy survives an impossible gunfire situation Why was the gun there?Why did it seem to do very little to the building?Why did it even shoot at him?And I guess more importantly how the f did he and his dog survive?Tone. All over the place and horribly inconsistent Maybe it's trying to be funny. I have even heard the worries dark and satirical. Well let's just say Gervais doesn't have to worry about any competition any time soon. It's isn't funnyEffects. Vary a lot. General scenery is often good. The pink lake monster utter shteWhy was there stereotypical ash shape humans you know the ones after a nuclear fire right outside the vault that have apparently been untouched and suffering no erosion after 200 years!!!!Why does the idiot and annoying squired gadget just happen to be able to instantly track the ghoul right when it was convenient!Why is Maximus such an idiot? Why leave his armour un hidden for anyone to nick? Why leave the giant gun behind? Why leave his supplies behind? Why reveal himself to his squire after treating him like absolute crap? His character needs to die quicklyThe power armour. Not bad but that entrance into the settlement as in the trailer omg bad and cheesy doesn't even touch itHow does a ninja kick suddenly allow you to knock a robot saw away. Looked pretty sturdy to me . Oh yeah and with a severe foot injury that seemed to just conveniently disappearOh and I know it's the whole retro theme thing but seriously that doesn't mean the vault overseas and the people living there have to be completed stupid.If they screw up 40k this bad I'm gunna be real upset.
2	Baby raindeer is not only about self hate and trauma but about honesty and communication and loneliness. Donny is so difficult to watch in the first episodes because he is painfully dishonest with himself and everyone else, especially when he is performing on stage. (It must have been so incredibly difficult for Dunn to play an old version of himself?!) He becomes more and more likeable as he opens up. Quite opposite to the result he feared. It's easy to hate him until you look at yourself and realise you are open when it comes to most things but you make exceptions for those few things that seem so unspeakable you will never share them. It so happens that he has experienced too many unspeakable things. Gadd is unbelievably, mindblowingly courageous.I also found the observations about the limitations of law to be very interesting. It's scary to know how easily the wave between legal and illegal can be surfed when one is knowledgeable enough. This goes hand in hand with the fact that most of the time, our own mistakes are what stop us from understanding and proving that we are the victim.We often see famous people speaking about their past traumas and we tend to mistakenly assume they must be fine now that they are rich and famous. This is why I am glad the series did not end when the main character obtains success, and that his problems are not magically solved by the achievement of his dreams.I loved little bits and details such as the written texts at the beginning of each episode and the effects on the last scene where he is sitting at the bar. I also loved Teri.
1	"I have watched the original chinese version and this is way off due to netflix effect, if you can find the original watch it in chinese, if you can't find it, then.. try to find the book series and read them. Otherwise, welcome to hell of netflix.Chatgpt fill the rest ""The Three-Body Problem"" is a science fiction television series based on the novel by Liu Cixin. It explores a universe filled with unknowns and mysteries, as well as the interactions and conflicts between humanity and alien civilizations. The storyline is gripping, delving into profound scientific and philosophical questions, making it a work rich in imagination and exploration."
2	"I've been looking forward to 3 Body Problem for what feels like a decade. I just binged the entire first season in two days and it's everything I hoped it would be and more. This series is adapted from the best selling novels of the same name. It's a show that will pull you into their world and not let go. There are so many mysteries that will keep your mind going the entire time. You can tell they put a lot of money into this show too because the visuals are absolutely beautiful. The only thing that could've been better was character development. I stole this quote from a review I read but I couldn't agree more, ""3 Body Problem sets a new standard for what sci-fi is capable of."" I'm already looking forward to next season. It can't come fast enough."
2	This thing exploded into one of my absolute favourites. Was a fan of Fillion's since firefly and Castle, and a good Edmonton boy like me, but this show really pops. Its got the writing, the feel, the casting and characters are superb , and I don't often say that about anything. It's a light show that can be very serious because the characters have the depth to pull it off, they get along and are super loyal to each other with out much of the soap opera crap that tries to force a storyline. This is a REALLY good cop show.
2	Colin Farrell is simply perfect in this role. Vulnerable yet strong, serious yet fun, and mysterious yet open. Really stellar supporting cast with beautiful scenery of LA. A real trip back in time to the old style self-narrated private directive genre. Apple hasn't disappointed and continues its excellent record of releasing excellent limited series like this one. The only negative is in a world of instant gratification, waiting for a whole week for a new episode is torturous! But this is most certainly work the wait. Finally, I also love the embedded black and white clips from old detective movies throughout. It adds to the intrigue for me.
0	"I really wanted to watch this. I really did. And I really wanted to like this.There is just so much nudity that I am not continuing.This show seems to have lots of neat and interesting points to it. But I have seen ENOUGH of women's naked body parts. And I simply cannot stomach any more.Many people obviously don't mind this. But I absolutely hate that what looks like such an interesting show has been cheapened so badly. Some people may call it ""gritty"" and ""realistic."" I find it trashy. You can still imply things are happening without shoving it in your face.I am extremely irked because I simply love fantasy, and the mythical creatures, political situations, and intricate world makes me want to watch this badly.But I don't know if I can get through my disgust. I almost turned it off after seeing yet another de-robing of a woman (the second time with this particular woman) with her pointed parts in plain view, while a man proceeded to take advantage of her while she was crying. I mean, this show can stand on its own without all this stuff and still be successful. What is the point of throwing in this trash? Is titillation to draw in perverted viewer counts worth ruining what could otherwise be a very respectable timeless work? I believe that whoever decided to include this was directly, and absolutely, lowering the value of this work.Anyway, I'm sure many will disagree with me, but I was extremely disappointed.Additionally, yes there was a fair amount of gore. A lovely intestine hanging out of a freshly sliced man, maggots on a de-gutted deer with a closeup of its head and bloated tongue, be-headings with pretty views of the red neck meat. Ugh. It was not as bothersome as my prior complaint, but I don't have too much of a problem with gore. Also it wasn't as frequent.With so many positive ratings, I feel that my viewpoint should be put out there."
1	This series was absolutely infuriating to watch. It was a fine line between the main characters full of trauma, zero common sense and low EQ who desperately need help and healing, while watching in disbelief about how stupid and un-insightful some people can be.The characters consist of Donny and Martha, both unhinged, mentally unwell people.Teri, the only likeable character with common sense and helpful strategies.It is dark and depressing series, the 2 characters clearly not seeking any mental health support when it was needed, the people around them not really helping in any way. The feelings of shame and guilt from abuse and having very poor communication skills and low self esteem. A shame and a harsh reality of this is how some people actually live.
2	The biggest negative for me is that young Tom Ripley from Patricia Highsmith's book - a hero dramatic and naive, charming and destructive, very, very versatile in the virtuoso performance of Matt Damon - turned into just an old and angry loser. Andrew Scott is a talented actor, but where is the charm of youth and passion for life? Here Mr. Ripley is just a nasty petty thief - would you let someone like that into your home? And Dickie Greenleaf sees and understands people (like his father), why then did he trust this man, from whom immediately wanted to stay away?The main thing is that, as a big fan of the text, it seems to me that the image of Ripley in the book is deeper than what is embodied here. He is not just a sociopathic maniac - this is too simple a reading - Tom wants to be loved, wants to escape from the bottom of life (but at what cost...) But I want to watch the series to the end because of the passion of the director and cameraman for this story. And also because of the masterful work of other actors - especially the cruel-eyed Dakota Fanning and the charismatic and, at the same time, annoying Eliot Sumner (although after the incredible performance of Seymour Hoffman, I could not imagine another; but Eliot's Freddy - is super!) The black and white solution is intriguing - I was wondering when color would appear? (and, I admit, I didn't guess right).If we abstract from the book, from the films of Minghella, Wenders, Clement, then the series is a masterpiece - but my experience says that it is the book and the 1999 film that are real masterpieces. But this wonderful series, no, did not reach the level of a masterpiece. While there is a lot of fun to be had in watching it, it is a masterful work.
1	New season are not as good as how they used to be. They need to stop with this show..The old seasons were so good though!!!!!
1	This show was seriously so good up until Season 14! The show always had a political hint to it, but starting season 14, it became the whole show. No matter what side you sit on, bringing politics into a show you watch for pleasure is not fun.
0	"What a garbage season 8 is , most stupidest writing , anyone can write 1000 time better story than this garbage. There is so many unanswered questions and plots , winter came and gone just like that. Seriously I have wasted more time for this worst final season. I have read fan theories which are so much better than the final garbage we got. I feel sorry for everyone involved in making this series except writer. There was following lines I saw from movie that ""the characters change should come from the character not from writers"", till season 7 we can see and live along with the character and their development but season 8 so rushed and ruined everything. Some people defend the worst final season , I don't understand why ?"
0	"I cannot express how great this show was in its first 6 seasons. It was, the single best fantasy based show in history and also one of the best written non fantasy shows in history...then, then the source ran dry. With having caught up to the novels the shows ""writers"" had to go to Martin for assistance with where the story was going to go.With season 7, Martin was able to give them just enough information from what he has to give them a decent amount to write with. With season 8, all Martin had to give them was the basics of what he was going to do and oh my GOD have these writers shown that they are terrible on their own.The flaws in Season 8 is so glaring, and stand out in ways that is at times gobsmacking.We know from season 2 that Harrinhall was ""melted"" by dragonfire, and told, specifically that is exactly what happens to stone, when a dragon breathes its fire and it hits it...well, screw that says the writers of Season 8. Now, dragonfire causes stone to explode like it was hit with a missile!This, along with great twists like the queen of dragons just up and ""Forgetting"" that her enemy has a fleet of ships even though she had just be told about them, and that they destroyed her own fleet and killed several of her key allies just months before that so they could kill one of her dragons, from impossible angles.Anyway, I should give the writers some credit in that I have never seen anything remotely like I am seeing right now, with anything else...that almost every single person that I know that loved this show with a passion are now debating on not even watching the finale episode or not.Talk about wrecking a legacy."
0	You just lost me as soon as the first episode marriage act was concluded. Which part of the story is intriguing, can you at least introspect. Every bit of the plot is predictable with no interesting turns at all... despite going into 5 episodes deep.I am a big fan of west world, because you never fall back on story telling despite trying to build up a character arc... This misses badly here...You just lost me as soon as the first episode marriage act was concluded. Which part of the story is intriguing, can you at least introspect.

2	After watching the first episode of this series, I was hooked. The writers are amazing at keeping the audience entertained even after 11 seasons. I still love the show and the all of the characters. The drama isn't too overwhelming because they keep it mixed with events in going on in the hospital. Even though the kill off a lot of characters or send them somewhere else in the middle of no where, you cant stay mad at the show because they know how to always keep you hooked. The relationships between the character also will keep you watching and re-watching. Meredith and Christina's relationship made me wish my friends and I could be that close all the time. When Sandra Oh decided to leave it was the hardest good bye other than when they had the plane crash and killed Meredith's sister. Finally Meredith and Derek's marriage was doomed to happen ever since they first started dating. I always knew they would end up together and they are perfect even when they are fighting with each other. If anyone watches one episode of this show they will be watching for their whole life, especially since I've watched it five times.
2	Really enjoyable police show. Love Nathan Fillion, so knew if I liked the other characters it would be a win in my book. I love the other characters! Big disappointment that his first T. O. Talia was not back for 2nd season. She was a favorite. Not a fan of the replacement. I think the plots have gotten a little over the top. I doubt a rookie would be in front for a meth lab bust. Patrol, yes. Some of the other crazy stuff, I seriously doubt it but they have to make it exciting. Season 3 I believe ep 5 when he goes to college is the worst. Small class, he is in the minority being white, teacher is black. They all give him a hard time for being a cop. So ridiculous. I'm over it! Enough of sticking BLM into every show on tv. That episode gets 1 star. That is where I'm at atm. Will continue series on Hulu when I'm over this episode. Ugggh.
0	Everything they had been building up for is lost! The went against everything the books and shows hinted, teased even outrightly proclaimed till now. Everything from season 1 has become pointless. Jon and Daenerys have become pointless. The prophecy, the dragons, the warging of the stark children, the three eyed raven, quaithe, warlocks, Jon'ss resurrection is all pointless. It's just another drama with people fighting for a kingdom. The most pathetic end to a beloved series. It could have been great.
0	The rookie is the perfect depiction of the frailty of the illusion of societal safety guards, one of them namely the police. In essence it is just another detective show like ncis or law and order with a more hands on approach as the main point of observation being the police officers on ground with the suspects being apprehended.One main thing in common is the illusion of people adhering to protocol and process by the name of the law, removing obvious human flaws that comes with the faultiness of human nature. The police force is just too clean, just too sympathetic and by the book to be ever taken seriously. People knowing what they know about the reality of corruption, discriminatory practices and arbitrariness of police work, it appears to be more fairy tale than reality. Making it worse is how discriminatory and arbitrary sloppy police work is being downplayed while demeaning stereotypes are being praised in favor for policemen. The age of idealization of institutions and its officers is coming to an end as the distribution of information about the malpractice is becoming faster. So this show feels very much outdated while still trying to depict a corrupt institution through rose-tinted glasses.Shows like Brooklyn 99 or ,LA vice shows dealing mainly with police corruption, can be forgiven for that, as one is a parody and the other in essence a gritty character study. But a show of this caliber that tries to sell an idea of an institution instead of trying to tell compelling narratives is just too naive and falls flat in its approach.Not a very good look for nathan fillion who has done very little since firefly to further his acting career besides being the poster boy for american police propaganda.
2	"Was a bigger ""Castle"" fan than ""Firefly"", but so far ""The Rookie"" has been fantastic! Great character development and acting, interesting story lines and just enough action that each episode seems way too short. My only critique is that the two female officers look too much alike and I can't always tell them apart, but that could just be me. Really looking forward to the next episode. Bummer the whole season isn't released at once like Netflix. Highly recommend watching!"
0	The Fallout setting is supposed to be a somewhat tongue in cheek 1950s America that just never ended, so well up to the date of the nuclear war in 2077, appliances, cars, homes, clothing, etc. Are like they have been stuck in time for 120 years. The 1950s music is still there, as is the Mom and Pop culture.The intent is to ironically contrast that saccharine existence with the harshness of the apocalypse that arrives.Well ... this series kind of tanks that. The casting is like a commercial for Benneton or a UN diversity program and not 1950s America. None of the hair styles fit. None of the accents fit. None of the word choices fit. It's like the series just ran over to the nearest mall, found a bunch of kids and their parents, and asked them to pretend to be in the Fallout setting. Even the humour is typically straight from the Millennial handbag, with a ton of sarcasm and double entendres.This incongruity with the setting continues with the casting, where Brotherhood of Steel recruits (called Aspirants), some of whom have been training with the Brotherhood as foot soldiers for most of their childhood, look like they haven't done a push up in their lives. They don't look like recruits with years of physical training, they look like their only battles were with controllers in their hands. The notable use of a waifish, almost skeletal actor to play the 'best' Aspirant in the pile, the one chosen for promotion, when that actor looks like they would struggle breaking bread or holding a coffee for any extended length of time is a good example. They clearly cared more about that person's demographic makeup than they did whether they actually looked like what the role demanded.The main character from the vault is effectively a Mary Sue. In the first episode, she spouts her vault resume to convince the leadership of the vault that she's a good candidate for marriage to a man in another vault, something they do to help the bloodlines. She's literally good at everything she does, from hand to hand, to shooting, to science, to people, to bravery, to intelligence ... her only flaw is being naive, and that gets cured out of her quick, so her one real flaw is more or less gone by the end of the first episode.There's a lot of nods to items, people and places in the game, but this is where it gets messy. The absolute and utter retcon of the lore in at least four of the games by this series is, well, unforgivable. An entire faction, probably the most positive and interesting one, is completely wiped off the Earth. It just doesn't exist.I watched long enough to learn that, and then shut it off. It was OK, and moderately entertaining to that point, with the caveats listed above, but if you want me to swallow your casting nonsense and utter disregard for the setting at the same time, that's just not going to happen.I've given it four stars out of deference to the games, but this show isn't really all that good at all. There's a lot of fans who will clearly vote it up because Dogmeat is in it, or the Junk Jet, or a cool cowboy ghoul, but the core jobs of making a compelling story, the writing, the casting, and the sets only see one stand out (the sets). You really need all three.The retcon, though? Unforgiveable. The show runner should honestly be ashamed, after saying time and time again that his show was canon. That was 100% a lie.
2	Fallout was my most anticipated series of this year, and I'm happy to say it did not disappoint.First of all, it looks spectacular. They absolutely nailed the look and aesthetic of the Fallout universe, and its reliance on more practical effects, rather than overusing CGI like most modern series, really showed.The cast was very good. Ella Purnell was a charismatic lead, and it goes without saying, but you can't go wrong with Walton Goggins.The story was very well written, making the show part of the same continuity of the games, without adapting any game in particular, I think, was a good choice. It truly felt like the writers respected the source material, which unfortunately is a very rare trait in video game adaptations.Following on from the success of The Last of Us, Fallout makes me look forward to the future of video game adaptations, and very excited for the Mass Effect and God of War series Amazon Prime currently have in development, as it is clear that they can make a TV series based on a popular video game series, truly incredible.9/10 - Amazing.
1	"From the outset with the old white guy hooking up with the young woman of color this series displayed it's timeworn approach. The acting is actually occasionally not bad and the dialogue passable. But the stories for each episode are so often insipid that ""who cares"" or ""no way"" would that have happened are the usual results. Could have given it a 5 frankly, but actors deserve better."
1	We have really enjoyed GoT since its first episode, have just watched the episode 3 from season 8, to be honest I was very disappointed, to say the episode cost over 11 million to make, the whole episode was so dark you couldn't make out what was happening. Absolutely shockingI cant believe I have to acknowledge whether I'm giving anything away, I couldn't see anything to spoil your enjoyment
0	Fallout: Expectations Will FallAdapting movies and shows from video games seems to be a new trend in Hollywood. This can sometimes be confusing for the audience, if the show does not do a decent job at explaining what is happening, such as in the case of Amazon's new show, Fallout. Jonathan Nolan etal, and executive producer, Todd Howard. It stars Ella Purnell from Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.After the apocalypse destroyed the Earth, 200 years ago. A select number of people got to take shelter in vaults (safe from the outside world). However, when Lucy's dad is taken, she decides to go outside to find him.This show may sound like other shows, such as the 100, but unfortunately Fallout is confusing, pointless at times, and a little bazaar.The first couple of minutes of the show were unnecessary. It explained how the apocalypse happened, but the characters that participated in it had nothing to do with the rest of the story. The timeline jumps to the vault survivors 200 years later. The way the show jumps between two plotlines, (the vault dwellers and people on the ground) is very confusing. The show never makes it clear what the ground people are trying to accomplish. Nothing like how the 100, portrayed the sky people and the grounders. Maybe Fallout should have introduced the ground people, only when the storyline had Lucy (Ella Purnell) needing to know of them. The only way I was able to figure out who some of the characters' names were, was by looking them up. The show does a bad job of introducing other people, besides lucy.For a show labeled as a drama, Fallout has some very strange moments. A dog who eats things that most dogs would not, such as people, a robot that does not seem to serve a purpose in the plot, and very odd creatures that attack people on the ground, for no reason. If the robot were helpful and friendly, like the one from Lost in Space, that would have given Fallout a likable creature.The only two characters that make this show, not completely terrible is lucy and Cooper Howard (Walton Goggins), or as I call him, grave dude, since he rose from the dead. Purnell did a good job at portraying Lucy's caring and innocent nature, in a world where all they seem to do is violently fight. This show may have been a little better if it only focused on the adventure Lucy is having to go on to find her dad. If you are looking for Fallout to be another good apocalyptic siFi show, like the 100, your expectations will fall.
0	Where's Ron Pearlman ?I love Fallout World since the first game but this poor adaptation is more like fallout 76 squeezing the Lemon , than plant the seed of something great.Does not capture the ambience of desolation of wasteland , even the clothes seems brand new not trash that we used to, the locations don't feel real, looks like a plateau set of a studio. Not even mentioned the forced ethnic protagonist.The power armour feels synthetic not real. The CGI is not well designed.The actors done good , but the ambience lacks of POST APOCALYPTIC ADAPTATION (very bright lightning ).Too much bethesda and so little Little black isle style for me.War War never changes... money either.
0	It's not good. It really isn't. I gave it a good shot, watched 4 episodes then got fed up and switched it off. Normally I love any cult or fantasy TV but not this one.There's too many macho long speeches and they get sooooo boring. I had to fast forward a couple. All that male posturing. Yawn! Double yawn. It's like Van Damme in furs, except at least you could laugh at him.I liked some of the younger characters, the dwarf and a couple of the females were okay. But then some old bloke would start gassing on again! To make matters worse every 10 minutes someone mentions the word 'brothel' or 'whore'. What a bunch of happy prostitutes all women are. Gawd even I know that's rubbish and prostitution done out of necessity. Oh, and there's too many characters! I was expecting something amazing because of the rave reviews so many chaps have given this. Sadly no.
0	"The first of Highsmith's novels about psycho Tom Ripley, re-interpreted in a series of sterile, icy vignettes filmed in gorgeous black and white.Probably to save money on the settings, only corners of the locations mentioned are shown (NY, Atrani, Naples, can't see a thing in San Remo, etc...) Since I'm Italian, I found the Italian locations particularly disappointing. The series was shot in cold weather and seeing Dickie and Marge alone on the beach and then bathing in the sea was weird. I never saw an Italian beach (or village) so deserted, not even in winter. It looked like only three people lived in Atrani and Naples was not much better (never seen the city so clean and orderly).As mentioned by others, Andrew Scott is too old to play Ripley, described as a 25 yo in the novel, nor has he the charisma of a psycho, but mostly looks sneery and frozen-faced. Johnny Flynn seems too young to be moving into Tom's circle, and Dakota Fanning doesn't seem to have much of a range, except sulking. Freddy, the elephant in the room - let's say it mercifully - is ""miscast"", a far cry from the malignant but hearty presence of Hoffman in the Minghella movie. However, it's an excellent example of nepotism.Each episode seems crystallized in minimum, emotionless dialogue, from the dreary NY opening to the cold meeting of Tom and Dickie. One wonders why Dickie would invite Tom to stay with him when their relationship boils down to concise, almost surgical sentences about nothing. The ""investigative"" sessions are a joke, even given low investigative standards. The episode of the boat is conveniently forgotten; no appeal such as ""Have you seen this man?"" is made in newspapers about the allegedly ""missing"" Ripley and the Italian authorities never contact the American Embassy to get info about the people involved.All episodes are like Dickie paintings, limp and lifeless, mediocre attempts to produce feelings only an original could evoke, be it film noir, Hitchcock, or the more recent ""Talented Mr. Ripley""."
1	"I didn't read the original.Overall about season 1: the idea is interesting and first 3-4 episodes are bingeworthy. But then it is looks like standard movie about alien threat.I wanted to see more about helmets and games.Show's name is ""3 body problem"", but I actually didn't understand why. Ok, they mention it in the game, ok we all know that this problem doesn't have the solution, we know that aliens come from such system. So, what? Is the fact that we have ""3 chosen ones"" means that in season 2 these 3 will create ""the other 3body problem"" for aliens?If aliens have such a cool technological state, why didn't they come to other planets, but coming to Earth? How were helmets created? Who is finding the cult? (I don't believe that Tatiana is coming from UK to China on her own funds). Will we even see aliens in future? I don't think so btw. Why do they even need helmets if they can make people see what they want?Lots of questions. I hope, we will get some answers in the season 2. For now: not brilliant, sorry."
0	"Season 1 and 2 were very enjoyable...then once again Hollywood tries to become ""woke"" and mixes in ""political"" agendas with dashes ""social justice"". As a result the show takes a huge dive and a complete waste of season 3. At what point will Hollywood realize if we the people wanted their ""Woke"" political views, we would turn on Entertainment Tonight or CNN...? Shame..."
0	This show had so much potential. The previews made it seem like it was full of action but you continue to wait for more action. Some episodes are absolutely boring and just when you think the action is coming it doesn't. It builds up to a final showdown for the series finale and then guess what it doesn't come. Final episode is probably the most boring of the entire show. The storyline is great and the potential was there to be one of the greatest samurai shows or movies ever made but it disappointed. I thought the ending was going to be something like we saw on The Last Samurai but it wasn't. If you looking for a show that is a Drama show with a little action then go for it. But if you want a lot of action pass on it.
1	Seen so much ab It this series posted on Facebook that I thought I had to watch it. However it was not what I expected at all. It was very weird and not in a good way. Normally I would have switched off after the first episode but something kept me watching until the end. It was a very disturbing story based on true life experience and it just left me wondering over and over again why he allowed to to be in that position time and time again and why he went into situations knowing that they were wrong and bad. The stalker definitely needed help as she was bonkers but I think so did he for the things he done and went back to over and over again. I would recommend it but I'm not sure why as it was a strange one to watch and just left me with so many questions.
2	Years ago, I burned out on cop shows. Maybe 10 seasons of CSI did that to me. But this show sparked an interest in me again. It has added a realism that has been absent in every cop show to date.And if he can't be playing in firefly, or castle...then I will follow him here because he has a presence that makes you just pull into the show and care about the protagonist.
2	It hurts me like hell to have rated this a 9 because it could have easily been a 10 if it wasn't for season 7 and 8. There are enough commentary on the finale so I won't go on a tangent. But I'll just say, setting the bad bits aside that this show is still a divine, everything about it was just too perfect to be true.
2	Don't get me wrong this is still the best serie ever. But I agree with the rest season 8 is so rushed. The dialogues that make this serie so great are just rushed or are non existing in season 8.
1	"I'm enjoying this so far. I thought the reference to the shot in Mann's Miami Vice that Colin Farrell starred in was hilarious. I like that the character is like Mr Rogers IRL but Batman at night. So, heres the problem. They already gave away the ending in episode two, unless there's an amazing twist. I'm sure there will be a red herring here or there, but it seems like the son David was a ""client"" of the bad guys and the daughter and the lady from the office were looking into it and that is how the one bad guy in the trunk got killed and the daughter is on the run because she did it or something."
0	This show was an obsession for like 7 seasons.. I admired Yang, I cried hard for George, I fell in love with McDreamy, I gasped at plane crashes and crazy surgeries and loved it all. But for the sake of future fans... please stop. Please. Make. It. Stop. It started at the top and now it's here.. way way way down at the bottom of the pile of great shows that turned into boring non-relatable whiny characters, woke life lessons storylines and tone deaf producers who don't know when to stop flogging an already dead show in stead of just being what it is. I came here for hospital drama. Pretty sure we all did. Stop it. Stop it now!
0	I am SO over the sorriness of our 'entertainment' industry. It's becoming a rarity to find productions that elevate the human spirit, instead of bashing it to bits with a sledgehammer. At its core, this series is a celebration of human decay, mental health disorders, self-harm, personal and financial irresponsibility, sexual violence and promiscuity, drug abuse and addiction, poor judgment, social breakdowns, and general ickiness.This is just sickly and gross, as well as wildly demeaning to viewers and actors alike. I can't imagine anyone participating in this that won't need trauma counseling afterward.
0	"Where to beginn? The actors are far too old. Andrew Scott as Ripley has absolutely no charm. It is unbelievable, that Dickie wants him near. Especially after he brought the Mafia guy to the house. That he did not throw Ripley out after this I will never understand.The black and white is beautiful but only style over substance.Its soooo slow, but it adds nothing to the story or the personality of Ripley; just endless stair walking and endless murdering scenes... It seems like the filmmakers wanted to create the opposite in every aspect to the wonderful film ""The talented mr. Ripley"".The casting of Elliot Sumner as Freddie ,for example, is the biggest contrast to PSH but it does not work at all.I just wanted to like the series but ended up rather hating it..."
0	I have been watching the show since the beginning and I literally just made this account because I needed to express how disappointed I am in the last season. Especially the most recent episode😩. To say it was corny, would be an extreme understatement. It was literally unbearable to watch.
2	A brilliant retelling of a classic story. The skill shown with the camera shots, framing, environment is captivating. The clever use of lighting as well. Which provides nods to old black and whites. Andrew Scotts performance is brilliant! Troubled but calm. Measured but frantic. Deeply neurotic.A must watch if you liked the author or the hollywood film. I think the Talented Mr Ripley is a classic in its own right. So this should not be compared with Ripley. Instead celebrated alongside.I look forward to what the Director does next, I also think it shows the power of great dialog and strong one on one characters.
0	Hated it from the first scene. It got worse. FFWD through the rest. I did better TV on VHS, while at the police academy, in 1973. At least I can now record something different on Sunday without conflicting with this garbage.
0	If you have a little respect for yourselves please please please end this series and let us remember it for the passion and the magical moments it gave us before you destroyed it.Show some respect
1	"I remember watching the 80s version of this series back in the 80s, 90s, and 2000s and it had a good story, decent action, and it seemed to keep you wondering and looking forward to the acting.This new version....it's just so bland, so ""default"", doesn't seem to have actors with any heart or spirit. It's like they just got up there and read their parts, cashed their checks, and went home.I mean Joh Rhys-Davies MADE the 1980 show as well as Richard Chamberlain. Together they were dynamic. And the asian actors seemed to have personalities you really wanted to follow.This show, they justy don't have any really impressive spirit to their characters.Others may not agree but i just don't see it in this version..."
1	Please take into account that 90% of positive reviews haven't played a fallout game before, and it shows.Not even the great cast could can save a storytelling that tries to dillute the interesting stories and setting that has kept me entertained for dozens of years: I mean, you have the whole fallout universe and lore to play about and you chose a lame vault, depict the brotherhood as weak and stupid, and a girl that seems so naive that talks and gives water to a guy with no pants on, on top of that you forget three major, charismatic fations (NCR, enclave and legion), I mean where's the character development, the intrigue, the oh snap moments...The CGI are average and they don't disappoint but they are nothing to write home about either, the action scenes are lame and boring, coming from a player that has nuked the whole wasteland several times with my faithful fatman (portable nuke launcher).I mean, is a decent show, but let me give you an advice: go play the games, there you will find the stories, the drama, the no win situations, the dry humour, etc...
0	"Attempt 2.This show is really quite bad, and I'll do my best to explain why this will be the case for both fans of the games and those who haven't played the games.1) Storyline:The first thing we hear at the start of every game is ""War, war never changes"" as the main plot is Communist China goes to nuclear war with 50's America (in an alternate timeline where America has household luxuries and conveniences all powered by nuclear energy). Even their coca-cola drink is called 'nuka-cola'. This extends to robot house servants, vehicles and the U. S. military's soldiers armour, called power armour. The frontline of this war is in Anchorage Alaska where Communist China invades America.Ah but not anymore! The writer's have made the show anti-Capitalist and pro-Communist, there is no Communist China, and war..doesn't happen to need to change, as the writer's suggest the nefarious company 'Vault Tec' alone caused nuclear destruction. So the main plot of the whole game franchise is thrown out of the window and mutated like a glowing one, to not bad mouth daddy Marx. And so we see 50's America as the nukes fall, and evil (redacted) man pushes a (redacted) character to steal his place in the vault (another neo-Marxist theme we will see regularly).The show is set a few decades after the games which if the writer's gave a single eff about would've been good. They could have done a lot of fan service and used a tonne of rich source material to write a compelling storyline and world, but having ignored practically all of the game franchise, this show ignores Obsidian Studio's Fallout New Vegas' existence. The NCR (New California Republic who would've freed and controlled the area in the show, and found the vault dwellers or raiders in the area, are non-existent nor mentioned. Let me repeat, a whole republic complete with armed forces and flag, suddenly doesn't exist. This shows resentment for the source material by the writer's and by Bethesda even who have stated the many plot holes and hugs changes to the games in this show is canonical. Well, ok then.The Brotherhood Of Steel in the franchise are a disciplined military order that aim to find all technology from the old world (from ruins and old buildings etc) and help rebuild the world with order. They are strict, devout to their cause and at times unforgiving. In the show, the BoS are mainly shown as a group of snot nosed liars, thieves, an undisciplined thugs it feels like. One of them is a token neo-Marxist inclusion by the writers I can't elaborate on. Another is the side protagonist Maximus. Maximus is another token character, poorly written, very incompetent (this is a theme we'll touch on soon) and he is written like he is a potato, great job representing POC (not). He can be thought of as budget Finn from the doomed JJ Abram's Star Wars trilogy. In fact, this show has elements in common with that trilogy. And a bizarre obsession on part of the writer's with eugenics that defies reality of 50's America. But the writer's long abandoned any thought.The main protagonist is Lucy, a vault dweller. She is what is known as a Mary Sue character, her father (the overseer of the vault) gets kidnapped by raiders and she takes a knife to the abdomen, but don't worry about this tragic start, Lucy is magically very competent and dangerous, skilled with weapons, physically and mentally strong, she doesn't need no man you misogynist bigot. (Or any compelling backstory or writing from an IQ above lukewarm to explain how she became such a competent and skilled woman despite living a sheltered life in a vault complete with familial interbreeding). Rings Of Power, JJ Abrams Star Wars, Helsing. Some of the worst written female character's from some of the worst movies and TV shows, do have this poor writing style in common. Nothing was learned from great written female role models like Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley.We also see raider's make an appearance, and see again that above mentioned common neo-Marxist theme and one bonus! Certain people in this are always bad, I can not elaborate here. Also all male character's in this are written as beta males, that is to say very incompetent, weak, stupid and relying on other's (strong women). The raider's are perhaps the only competent male characters in the show besides the ghoul played by Goggins. The raiders are dangerous and violent (as they should be) but another sheltered vault dweller who is pregnant and took a knife to the eye, is here to take down all of the raiders with a firearm suddenly. I felt this part will really resonate with heavily pregnant blind women who aspire to be Rambo in spite of basic reality.The tone of the show is far too silly, the franchise is supposed to be at least 80% dark and sombre, and 20% dark humour. These numbers became more equal with Bethesda's Fallout 4. But this show makes everything way too comical and silly, which creates a really light and not so desperate tone. This is meant to be about nuclear war but that aftermath never feels like it's a real problem.2) The dialog:The dialog like the plot for this show, is absolutely terrible, I can't state this more clearly. One scene on episode 5 at around 22 mins between Lucy and Maximus, which has smatterings of once Bolsheviks again, feels like it was written by a rudimentary AI from 2004 that was asked ""write Fallout as though you suffered a heavy concussion and are partly drunk"". Everyone who has seen this clip online seems to have the same thought ""this can't possibly be real, this must have been made by a software or something"".Fight choreography: When Maximus fights the ghoul, the ghoul sounds like he's firing rubber CGI bullets, and Maximus in power armour literally looks like he's being pulled around on a rope, this scene like many other's is cringey and not very immersive, it's hard to take it seriously or even comedically.3) Production:Some of the sets look like they were made in someone's backyard, the CGI or transition to it is very noticeable and at times rough. The BoS power armour looks like plastic cosplay (it's decent, but doesn't look metallic). Goggins as the ghoul looks fairly good, although he isn't supposed to have ears as he's a ghoul. Some of the production looks decent, some of it looks bad or like little care was given.Is there anything good about this show?Goggins as the ghoul, you could get rid of Lucy and Maximus (or make them side character's with little screen tome) and just have his story, and this would have worked or have been more compelling and interesting.Overall, whether you played the games (Obsidian or Bethesda made) or whether you know nothing about this franchise. The best advice I can give, is watch the movie instead that inspired the Fallout franchise. 70's 'A Boy And His Dog'. Tis show was made by the Westworld writer, and if you know anything about that show, it was one of the worst written shows made (although in that show's case, the start was very promising which can't be said of this Fallout show)."
0	I know it is not, but it looks like a Zach Snyder vehicle.Multiple locations without connectivity? Check Lack of character development? Check No understanding of character's motivations? Check Irritating music or score always in the background? Check Lot's of action yet still seems boring? Check Single thin female warrior who cannot act and you really to not care if she lives or die? Check Story pushed along by plot device instead of cohesive writing? Check Not sure who to root for? CheckThe only difference between this and Rebel Moon is that Rebel Moon took place entirely in a green screen warehouse. Here, the actual backdrops are real.
2	I heard about this and that it was based on an award winning book. It starts in the late 1960s in China and follows the misfortunes of Ye Wenjie who's father is killed by revolutionaries and ends up doing hard labour. But she is a scientist and her talents are spotted and she ends up working in a remote observatory with a radio Dish searching the heavens. One day she sees something on the monitor. Is someone trying to communicate. What she does will effect all of mankind...Move forward to present day and a group of Oxford friends, some with genius IQs, are met with a tragedy when one of them commits suicide. Enter Benedict Wong as a mysterious detective called Clarence with a very British accent and a deadpan delivery. He's brilliant!There are strange headsets that have the power to transport the wearer into three dimensional worlds where they are tasked with solving a problem involving saving a civilization. This goes to places you don't expect and I've only just touched the surface.All of the cast are excellent but Wong, Jess Hong as scientist Jin, and Liam Cunningham as the rich and powerful Thomas Wade with a no nonsense, take no prisoners attitude, are all exceptional.It is mind blowing stuff. I literally watched episode 5 open mouthed. It's cerebral, intelligent, thought provoking and truly unique. I cannot wait for season 2!
1	I've loved the Fallout universe since the first game. Post-apocalyptic but not quite sci-fi. The show really nailed the scene and supplied a decent plot, but some of the acting and dialogue was just...off, and dry as the wasteland itself. It also tried to inject too much humor - Fallout is a more serious game, but the show keeps trying to make us laugh.I really want to like the show, so we'll see if I can make it through the whole thing. At least they got the general feeling right, from the general item names to the various groups of people. It just seems like they should've hired some better writers.
0	The plot has been dumbed down, and is rife with plot holes.The CGI seems like it's from the previous decade, just with filters from the 2020s.The cast seem like they're part of some reality show, just thrown together randomly. The Oxford Five appear to be strangers who just got a one-pager about their own characters, forget their friends.The music was exceedingly disappointing, sounded like someone had given an AI the prompt 'Make Ramin Djawadi type Sci Fi music' and that's what was used for the final version.As far as Sci-fi goes, it has more of Season 4 Westworld vibes, and as far as Benioffs go, Got Season 8 vibes. So the worst of both worlds. Poorly adapted, overfunded, disappointing adaptation of a seminal and gorgeous piece of science fiction.Someone also please show Ramin Djawadi proof instruments beside pianos and orchestral ensemble strings exist. Oh, and that there are octaves below the third octave.I don't think I've posted reviews before but I guess posting how we actually feel about stuff like this is the only way to make sure the same crap doesn't happen again.
0	I'm not sure how are people rating this show so high? Reached episode 4 and the show just turned weird. Couldn't watch it any further. The jokes in the show didn't make me laugh. The only character I liked was Teri. To me the show didn't make much sense in the way it was going. It's awful that this a true story, but it wasn't engaging in any way. I felt like the show gives out a wrong message about how cowardly the main character is and how he didn't have the courage or the wisdom to report the incidents any sooner to the police. Again, I've only watched it upto mid episode 4, so my review is based on that.
0	Sadly just terrible. Big fan of the game series, so my dissapointment is immeasurable since a rendition this bad means it won't be renewed. Amazon is just a plague for IPs and now another one is effected by the blight of bad acting (looking at your smug clueless face Aaron Moten), terrible extras (Filly was a disgrace, on par with the monstrous modern star wars series) and ridiculous choices made by Amazon. People giving this a good review are on serious copium, shilling for amazon or they have lost their mind. I am immeasurably dissapointed and am now going to shoot my dog as a sacrifice to the gods in hope that they will curse Amazon out of existence.
1	"I'm not familiar with the original book the show is based on, but after watching the final episode, there was one word that came to my mind: Seinfeld. Or as people call ""the show about nothing"".The reason why is because the title of the show ""Shogun"", doesn't exist in the story. Yes we get a 1 minute sneak peek about Toranaga's intentions, but it's just a plan, a dream. And of course the whole show is about making him the Shogun because the other side is evil, but in order to achieve his goals he sacrifices literally everyone around him.He's not better, actually worse because he doesn't attack his enemies, he just kills off his allies. And of course you won't see any of plotting, the plans, because the story focuses on others, whose lives actually less important than his. The story that would be interesting happens off screen of after the show, that we will never see.It's a huge disappointment, and I'm not saying that because I wanted more action, I just wanted a good story where things happen on screen. Otherwise I could just go and watch Seinfeld."
1	The conclusion to the First Season cliffhanger had me excited for the Second Season Opener. However, i was completely disappointed by its conclusion as one can be. I expect better writing, not the same old crap from every other show. If you dont expect to get the character to move on from a bad cop, and advance. Then watching this show immediately got old. I expected better...
2	Till season 7 very likely the best TV show ever made in terms of suspense, character development, plot, effects, acting.... 10/10 with no doubt! But S6E10 is probably the point where you should stop and imagine your own ending. It is guaranteed better and has more character development. Otherwise you may end up rating it down by more than just one and are overcome by disappointment...
1	30 min episodes a week for a slow neo-noir is wrong, makes the watching a painful experience. The whole series should have been uploaded at once. I lost interest after the 2nd episode.The acting was solid with a promising plot, but convoluted, boring and difficult to follow.The title implies differrent seasons: Spencer, Richer, Magnum... A better title would he been A sugar rose, or something like that, implying a limited series.For a tv-series the characters should have been better developed. I am sure Chandler and Dashiell Hammett wouldn't have like it.Anyway, if you are curious, wait until the last episode and bing the series in one go. As it is, I don't recommend it.
0	"I didn't even have to be told this show is produced by a woman, but I looked it up to verify and sure enough it is. The show is so overtly pro-female/anti-male that you just know an endorsement from Oprah Winfrey will be coming soon. Everything irritating about this show could be summed up into a moment of dialogue from one of its episodes. After constantly berating, belittling and humiliating her roommate George, and never hesitating to make it clear to him that his opinion means nothing to her, Izzie (short for Isobel) asks him in all seriousness, ""Did you feel like I was emasculating you?"" Even more incredulously, she said it with a straight face.""Emasculating"" is the key word in this show. The hospital of this program is populated with women with chips on their shoulders and men who are bastards until these women set them straight. In one particular episode a rape victim is callously dismissed by the surgeons until the intern reminds them that she has a name--the ol' new-girl-teaches-the old-farts compassion trick. Beyond that, the doctors remove from the woman's mouth something which none of them but our heroine, Meredith Grey, can identify : the end of the rapist's penis.I'm not even all that perturbed by the idea of a bitten-off penis, for a rapist would surely get what he deserved, but do you mean to tell me that a room full of MALE DOCTORS couldn't identify a penis while a WOMAN could? Where is this hospital so that we can all avoid it? The program constantly features Izzie wearing next to nothing as she walks around the house she shares with Meredith and George. Improbably, George (whom we can only assume is straight) complains about this, only to prompt her poke her head into the shower while he's there. Meanwhile, there's cocky Alex who mocks her modeling days and she gets even by stripping in front of him. If Izzie is so concerned about being taken seriously by the hospital crowd then why is she so contemptuously undressed in front of George, someone who could be her ally, yet offended by Alex's motivations? I guess you're asking yourself why I watch this show if it bothers me like this, and the answer is that otherwise it can be engaging. I can even overlook that fact it features Patrick Dempsey, an actor I've disdained--pre or post rhinoplasty. It takes place in Seattle, a city in which I once lived and continue to love, so it makes me feel connected to that particular place. This show has all the framework of being a great program, and I don't even mind the chick power stuff adding a little verve. I just wish they'd take it back a few notches and make the males (beyond Dempsey's character) a lot more sympathetic."
2	"Right, well this series is definitely one that I had been waiting for. And once it was released, I sat down and binged the entire first season.I have been a huge fan of the ""Fallout"" games and have been playing them ever since the very first game was released. So yeah, there definitely was something riding on this series. And it was a franchise that so very much deserved either a movie or series adaptation. So thumbs up to Amazon Prime for bringing this to the audience.The storyline throughout the first eight episodes that was season 1, was a nicely written one. It definitely felt like a storyline and narrative that you would find and expect in the ""Fallout"" universe. So the writers nailed it on the head, because this was entertaining and enjoyable from start to end.They had a great cast ensemble in the series, with some good leading performers and also good support performers. There were a fair amount of familiar faces on the cast list, and Walton Goggins was so nicely cast for the role of Cooper Howard. Needless to say that it was nice to see Aaron Moten portray Maximus, as that character is a core essential character in the lore of the ""Fallout"" universe.The character gallery in ""Fallout"" was good. Lots of interesting and memorable characters.""Fallout"" definitely had that particular post apocalyptic feel and touch to it that we love from the games. And the attention to detail throughout the eight episodes was phenomenal. I will say that the episodes are well-worth sitting down to watch two times; once for the story, then again for observing all the minute details and things from the games that made it into the series.However, the ""Fallout"" series was not all just great things, because it definitely also had its flaw. The series was missing iconic creatures such as super mutants, deathclaws, radscorpions, molerats, centaurs, etc. And I was also disappointed in not seeing the use of laser and plasma weapons in use throughout the series. Sure, you see laser weapons in the relic store, but would be nice to have seen them in use. These creatures and weapons are a big part of the ""Fallout"" universe.The setting and scenes throughout the series are good. Well, for the most parts. There were scenes that were not having that particular ""Fallout"" nuclear post apocalyptic feel to it. Here I am thinking of all the scenes where the wasteland had green plants growing.The wardrobe and props in the series were good. I really liked the costumes and props that you see throughout the series. And who can't help but cheer when you see the power armor for the first time.Regardless, Amazon Prime did a great job in bringing the game franchise to the screen, and I certainly was wholeheartedly entertained throughout the course of all eight episodes. And if you enjoy the games, then you definitely have to sit down and watch this.My rating of the first season of ""Fallout"" lands on an eight out of ten stars."
0	1 point for season 7 and 1 point for season 8. I wished the author written the scenario instead of the dumb&dumber.
0	Predictable script and pointlessly obscene violence alongside a heavily 'guardians-of-the-galaxified' musical fight scene.When the main character's proposed husband steps into frame all pouty and slightly rough, it was as if they weren't at all trying to hide that something bad was going to happen. Then follows a ridiculous scene where horrendously violent acts, such as the barrel of a gun being inserted into a man's mouth before the raider shooting at others through the hole in his head, go alongside comic relief characters saying 'funny' things while more slow-mo fighting occurs in the background.Following the atmosphere of the games, the soundtrack was always going to be a big part of this and I understand that the mix of violence and quirky humour was a big part of the games. In a live-action format I don't think this comes across in the same way and the scene I've mostly referred to seemed 'marvel-ised' and when I see films/TV following trends it really takes me out of the moment and discourages me from watching further.
1	That was what I did. Seasons 1 to 4 were absolutely magnificent. Engaging plot, intriguing characters, twists you don't see coming but in hindsight spot the breadcrumbs leading up to them. Chemistry! Pacing! Intelligent!Season 5 was a little bit draggy but had its outstanding moments especially Hardhome. Season 6 in my opinion was slightly better and on par with seasons 1 to 4. Season 6 also had the only satisfactory Stark reunion.Season 7 was when they started talking about bigger budgets and better CGI. Honestly, not worth the sacrifice. Daenerys and Jon's love story felt completely unrealistic and played up. The most memorable scene was Danny & co absolute belief they were going to overthrow Cersei... cut to that epic Highgarden scene. So yes, one or two moments but bad taste in your mouth.Season 8 was a goddamn fail. Like every fan can attest to. I saw a comment saying how fans are so ungrateful, asking if we can write any better. Why yes, yes I can. Some flaws : Cersei, wasted. Jaime, wasted. Euron, overdone. Rhaegal (dragon), wasted. Bronn, wasted. Sam, wasted. Ghost, wasted. Sansa, wasted. Gendry, wasted. Varys, wasted and overdone. Sorry, I'm choking up just naming these dreadful characterisations.The music is god tier fantastic, as is directing, props and costumes, as well as acting.
1	What is the message here? It started well, interesting, I couldn't stop watching.And then everything went downhill. To some extent, I can understand his relationship with Martha, but not with the abuser. It sent the wrong message in the last episode.And I was left with a kind of depressed feeling. That's why I'm going to give it a five and that's just for the first few episodes.I would not recommend this series to anyone.Too many characters are needed, so I'll just repeat some sentences.

1	"The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, in moody black-and-white; and the use of sound and evocative (creepy, haunting) music is perfect. The acting is great: you can't take your eyes off of Andrew Scott and Johnny Flynn complements him wonderfully; and all the supporting and bit players are fine.... EXCEPT for ""Freddie,"" who is just too creepy to convince anyone that he could possibly be a friend of Dickie's! I still like the Matt Damon movie better. For one thing, eight hours of Ripley is too much, and this version drags in parts (compensated by the cinematography). Matt Damon was a more convincing Ripley as a younger, less calculating sociopath. And the late Philip Seymour Hoffman as ""Freddie"" can never be topped; indeed, this ""Ripley"" version's Freddie apparently doesn't even try. 7 stars gets it for me....for a production of this length, I at least expect to see the characters eat a meal. (Apparently, they just survive on coffee and alcohol.)"
0	I have good moment with episode 1 and 2 in season 8 but I was disappointed with everything that happened after that
1	Ripley starts incredibly strong with fantastic cinematography, mysterious acting, and thought through direction. It has enough substance in that first episode that it would compel audience to binge second episode.And that's where you get acquainted with Netflix level writing. The acting goes down the drain with awkward stares and weird dialogues, not to forget nonsensical plot. It gets so annoying and slow that the episode becomes downright unwatchable.The ambiance, the sets, the camera shots are brilliant. But as what always happens, the writing reflects mediocrity and the show becomes sluggish beyond comprehension.Watching Episode one is highly recommended. Rest, you surely can watch to fix your insomnia.
1	"With his self-portrayal of his own personal disturbance and traumatic experiences in Baby Reindeer, Richard Gadd could be the new face of masochism. He spared no effort in depicting every sordid detail of being victim to rape, harassment and stalking, taking the saying ""airing one's dirty laundry"" to unchartered territory. When have we ever seen a survivor of such grotesque abuse approach the re-enactment of their various traumatic events, by themselves no less, with such unbridled gusto and painstaking detail?In the public meltdown that he enacts in episode 6, Gadd described his love for Teri as being surpassed only by his self-hatred; the result of which, his epically low self-esteem, he attributed as the reason for his repeated returns to his rapist (including towards the story's conclusion), and his continued dependence on Martha and her voice messages for validation even after she had pled guilty and was sentenced to nine months in prison.While it might seem to regular viewers that Gadd has sublimated a deeply distressing period in his life in the mid-2010s into a fearlessly creative and cathartic endeavour that ultimately culminated in this Netflix series, I think the truth is far more sinister. Gadd has finally managed to obtain the fame and approval that he admitted to desperately wanting by publicising and capitalising on his personal trauma. Baby Reindeer is his OnlyFans, with the content being his neuroses, self-loathing, public humiliation and other miscellaneous suffering, and now viewed by millions who are applauding this trauma porn.""Truth is stranger than fiction""; this rings especially true for Gadd and Baby Reindeer. Had this story merely been fictional, it would have been an expertly crafted and enthralling story and character study. As a true story depicted by actors removed from the events, it would have been a difficult but fascinating watch. However, to have Gadd play himself is to watch him intentionally reliving his trauma and potentially retraumatising himself ostensibly because he is still very much enslaved to his special brand of shame. As such, Baby Reindeer is not the product of someone who has overcome their inner demons to finally cultivate a healthy relationship with themselves."
2	Not like the rest of the shows, vey well done, it is not just procedures and cop work but the characters will make you care to keep watching and thats what is expected from a good tv show. its good the description said inspired by story otherwise i would have missed on great entertainment. but this shows goes a bit further in entertaining you it makes you see how hard it is being a cop and makes you appreciate there are people trained and willing to risk their lives to protect you. it brings shame on Hollywood constantly bringing politics to the police work and showing police as bad.
1	"While the TV series has received a lot of 10/10 reviews, I would encourage you to take those with a grain of salt. The show is decent, but it's not necessarily the groundbreaking, must-watch experience that some commenters make it out to be.As expected, the series does include representation for the raibow community, with a girls who uses made-up pronouns. However, I was disappointed to see the inclusion of a ""person of short stature"" and other minority characters that felt more like box-checking than genuine, well-developed representation.Overall, the TV series is worth watching if you're interested in the premise and have the time. But if you're looking for a truly exceptional viewing experience, you might be better off playing the original game that inspired the show. It seems to capture the essence of the source material more effectively.d."
1	Beautifully photographed. I watched and watched but only for the same reason I'd sit through a travel documentary. Unfortunately, the cinematography is the best this production could offer. If not for the earlier and far better adaptation of the Highsmith book, I might have actually liked this series. I don't think it's a casting issue - how could it be with such a brilliant ensemble?, but more an acting direction issue. Andrew Scott (I am a fan, believe me) eventually grew tiresome in his intensity. The range of emotion he is well equipped to convey (fear, tension, delusional, frustration, anger, hopefulness,....) got spun to endless repetition in the series. And ultimately in expressing such range, he forgot to be likeable (or at least a character that drew curious interest in his awkwardness) the way Matt Damon managed to do in the 1999 film. That Marge and Dickie take Damon's Ripley in their circle as a friend was thus believable. This was not the case in this 2024 series. Andrew Scott was too sinister and strange throughout that it made no sense for him to have struck a friendship Marge and Dickie (or anyone for that matter) at all. The sexual tension and attraction between Matt Damon and Jude Law (and Gwyneth Paltrow) was also sadly lost. And the levity and flirtatiousness in Gwyneth's portrayal of Marge was replaced by the more sombre and resultingly boring Dakota Fanning. Well acted overall - the actors did their job, but the director took the characters where they should not have gone. So unexpected that acting direction would be the flaw of this series, given the strong cast.
0	Honestly...after season 8...it all feels empty and unanswered.I'd say: Don't watch season 8....read fan theories...or better yet...make up your own ending...and wait for the books.
0	Loved the series (10/10) up until the very last episode, which utterly ruined everything (1/10). Before this episode I would recommend the series to everyone. Now I don't recommend it to anyone. Disappointing to say the least.
0	S8e3 was a disaster for this show like from the 1st episode they were talking about long night and it ended in a sec without even a fight
1	Game of Thrones will go down in history as the greatest decline in writing quality of all time.I used to love this show, the story, characters, the sprawling setting. It's one of the first series that really made me care and root for the characters. Even the irredeemably evil ones were still exciting to watch.But that all changed with the final season. Unless you have been living under a rock for the past year, its commonly known that George RR Martin has not released his final book of the franchise. The final two seasons were all HBO original content, and they could maintain the story in passable quality during the seventh season. However, when it came to ending the story it is rushed, anticlimactic, and immeasurably disappointing.Characters started acting stupid, or just entirely unlike themselves. Loved heroes become confusingly insane, they lost all semblance of motivations from past seasons and suddenly became totally different people. The writer's excuse? A new motivation from past seasons is written in to skip development, in other words, retcons galore.The dialogue became inanely simplistic or just repetitive and boring. So little of importance is ever said. Characters just stare off in the distance vacantly, then occasionally they make the most observances that anyone could have inferred on their own. What happened to the complex script full of setups, payoffs, and humanly written characters?The only thing left to do now is scrub the awful ending out of my head by rewatching the past six seasons. Then I'll wait for George RR Martin to release the true ending because this is an absolute disgrace. D&D spit in the faces of millions of GOT fans. The best recommendation I can give this show is to watch the first six seasons (and the seventh if you want to test your patience) then forget about season eight.
2	"I really enjoy this series and truly like the way the cast has always felt very cohesive and they just ""work""!Unfortunately, I have to say when Nolan's newest love interest, Bailey the Firefighter joined the cast, it was like What the Hell! Just threw the entire camaraderie feeling totally off! She just doesn't fit and spoiled the happy feelings?She not a very good actress, looks aren't everything! It surprises me they would disrupt a good thing? Not sure why, but she's still there. There has to be an answer to explain this subpar choice! I truly hope they come to their senses and send her off to some midday soap or something more suited for her lack of acting chops!"
0	I'm South African. The whole racism and blm been there done that. I signed up just to voice my disappointment I in S3. It was a brilliant show. Political agendas are meant for politicians not tv. They totally messed up this brilliant show. I hope they survive this fiasco and get back to where the show was. Nowdays good shows are few and far between without shoving agendas down our throats. Sorry, I'm dropping this show at S3 ep2. I really don't want to throw up.
0	Could have been a great series on feudal Japan based on how much painstaking work they did culturally and visually. Unfortunately, they decided to ruin it all with unnecessary crudity and pornography. Many of the ridiculously crass statements the characters make would not have been uttered by people living that time period, even if they were sailors and soldiers. In terms of its treatment of Christianity, the show has a laughably inaccurate representation of what Christian missionaries would have been like. In fact, the show goes out of its way to have some characters insult Christianity in crass ways, presumably inserted just to appeal to the depraved modern juvenile audience the show is seeking to please. It's the same reason it includes explicit sex scenes. No reason to have them, other than to cater to perverted minds. This show would have been so much better had it been cleaned up like Lord of the Rings or Star Wars. Instead, they decided to put one more nail in our culture's coffin.
2	Where should I start ? Grey's anatomy started out o.k., then it got better, but I stopped watching it after Shepard died. They should have ended it there, but no they are prolonging the story, bringing in new characters. Producers should learn to stop while they still have a good product and not keep going till they make a complete mockery of it (like with Prison break). I used to wake up at 6 a.m. to enjoy my coffee while watching the new episode of Grey's anatomy before going to work, but now I'd prefer watching looney tunes. Initially I had given it a 10, but because of the reasons above I changed my mind and made it into an 8.
2	Well, I had to come back to this to change my rating from 10 to 8. The last season was too disappointing to not do it. Everything about it was wrong. The most epic series of all time was meant to have a soap-operalike final season.
2	Season 8 was a disaster, but overall it's still a great series. Stop judging the whole series just because S8 was a disaster. S1-S6 was outstanding, S7 is great and S8 is not what we expected. This is one of the most unforgettable series, first because of it's outstanding seasons and second because of it's finale. It's still worth watching, sadly the series got rushed. People are acting like GoT's only season is S8. People forgot how epic and amazing this series was and they only remember the mistakes and bad things about it. This series doesn't deserve a 1-5 rating, even if the writing for S8 is bad and it got rushed, you can't deny the acting, cinematography, casting, and the music in this series are outstanding.
1	How did Nathan ever get involved with this series? Firefly and Castle were much better.
0	"Without Orson Wells, (or any) narrator, it was difficult to follow. While I don't mind a certain level of realism, if it's so harsh and dirty it starts to lose the entertainment value. Another ""remake"" that didn't need to be remade.Hollywood should try to make something new instead of over dramatizing older shows in an effort to be ""new"".This review really doesn't need to be the required 600 words,I have said all I need to say, but, I suppose there are many more word to describe this show. Like exhausting.I really preferred the original, like the remake of Perry Mason, it was attempted to be ""gritty"" to the point of ridiculous. Ah, my minimum character number has been met.This is my opinion only. If you have never watched the original, you should."
0	It's just sad. Re-watched the series every year and now i dont think i can re-watch it ever again. The last season ruined about everything
2	I'm amazed that, even in season 2, there still hasn't been an episode that I would consider below par. Every episode delivers stellar acting, a great story and a believable amount of thrill. I will admit that I tuned in for Nathan Fillion but I've become attached to all the characters and their story lines.
2	Greetings from the other side. I don't think I played this game back in 1997, as I was enjoying Ultima Online at that time. Therefore, I came into this without any preconceptions.I really enjoyed this first season, especially Coggins as the ghoul. There were some things that I didn't care for, like all of the old 50s music. It would have been better if they played less of that.The effects were good. The T-60 battle Armour was fun to watch in action. I'd love to try out something like that, as I'm sure we all would. The ghoul character was probably my favorite in this show. He was just so entertaining whenever he was on screen. Ella and Max were well done characters as well.I also enjoyed the various crazy characters that they bumped into during their journey.I'm looking forward to a second season, and totally recommend this series.
0	"When Castle ended, an idea was floated to kill off Kate Beckett and have Castle, Ryan, and Esposito relocate to California & the LAPD. The Gerald McRaney episode was a pseudo-pilot for the idea. Instead, Castle ended, and we got The Rookie as the Nathan Fillion Cop Show Project.Promos for The Rookie highlighted all the comedic bits of the pilot & first few episodes. After all, comedy is what Fillion fans have come to love & expect, especially fans of Con Man.Instead, we are given a much more serious show that is trying (and failing) to be the next Southland. Instead if following YOUNG fish-out-of-water rookie Ben Mackenzie, we ste following OLD fish-out-of-water rookie Nathan Fillion. But ABC is clearly not interested in giving viewers as gritty a show as Southland. Besides, Southland has already been there, done that. It's just serious enough to give Fillion some DRAMA for his resume, but not gritty enough to be off-putting to Castle fans who are unfamiliar with Fillion outside of Castle.The show still must pay lip service to those fans who expect Comedic Fillion. Every episode begins with self-deprecating comedy moment for our Rookie star. Sadly, it is these comedic moments that make the show suffer from split personality. Is it a fun Nathan Fillion comedy? Or is it a gritty Southland-esque drama? Sadly, it is neither.And what's the deal with writing off Mecedes Mason & bringing in Sarah Shahi? That screams of a struggling show trying to make changes to retain viewers. Or maybe it screams of Fillion's inability to work with female costars??? We all know Fillion & Stana Katic were at odds for a bulk of the series run (prompting some strange storylines & that Gerald McRaney LA episode/pilot). Did something happen between Fillion & Mason that led her being written off? Total supposition on my part, but it's where my mind immediately went.And tonight's episode features Felicia Dey. Whedonverse Stunt Casting!! I mean, I LOVED every time there was a Firefly reference or cast member on Castle. So, while my first reaction is ""YAY! Felicia Dey!! Captin Hammer FTW!"" My second reaction is, ""oh. Stunt casting. The show must be hemorrhaging viewers."" And again, bringing in Whedonverse actors means pulling viewers through the 4th wall, and making the drama less believable.What kind of show do you want to be, Rookie? Southland? Castle? Comedy with Whedonverse Stunt Casting? Make up your mind soon! It has already gone from ""must-see"" to ""that show I watch while I fall asleep & don't really care how it ends."""
0	If episode 20 is supposed to set up a spin-off series, please don't. It got to be the worst episode to date. I absolutely disliked 3 new characters, and you're also making the girlfriend a super-hero: EMT, Reservist Officer in charge of the armory theft, and back to EMT again. You may as well make her initials L. L.
0	Definitely a soap opera, so by definition nothing has to be real......this style is strangely addicting ---much more in the realm of entertainment -- also less stressful than some of the other so-called medical shows. Firstly there are rarely nurses in the show. They are the front line interface with the patients once the medical interventions are complete. When have you seen doctors sitting by a patient's bedside for longer than is required for a consultation or intervention. You never see doctors standing outside an emergency department waiting for the ambulance. The ambulance arrives; triage immediately; then physician & medi9cal orders. The list is tooooo long. As for sex --- don't ask; don't tell ---all depends on the hospital culture.
2	Absolutely fantastic series, started slow building the characters & got better & better with twists & turns you wouldn't believe but then the series overtook the original writing & was finished by a couple of jokers who totally ruined the last season, it seemed like it was rushed just to finish it off, so predictable I guessed everything that was going to happen, totally ruined a great series.
1	"I have loved, loved, loved this show since the very first episode. So much so that I was hooked from the very beginning and it gave me a new appreciation for doctors. The first several seasons were awesome but as each new one comes out, I find myself getting bored with the non-stop drama. Like, seriously, how much drama can one hospital and it's staff possibly endure? Especially Meredith, one of the main characters in the show in which it's centered around. It's unrealistic. It's starting to get really annoying. It's TOO MUCH DRAMA anymore. Which is sad because it has a wonderful cast and premise but now it's more like a soap opera which I must mention that I detest soap opera's! If they toned down the show and quit making so much unrealistic ""bad"" things happen to the cast members, then I might be still wanting more of the show. However, as I said before, it's ""Drama, drama, drama"" and I cannot take much more of it. Seriously. Twelve seasons already and I think this show should make a graceful exit soon before I pull my hair out."
2	"THIS is how you make a video game to movie/tv show series. THIS is how you pander to gamers while appealing to new audiences. THIS is excellent 21st century entertainment.I won't waste time explaining the premise, I'm sure you've gotten the gist by now from other reviews. Just know that it seems like gamer who are fans of the game series (such as myself) are quite happy with it, and that people unfamiliar with the game series (like my wife) are also engrossed with this show.SO MANY REFERENCES to the game makes it fun to watch as a long-time gamer fan. Everything, from junk decor like magazine racks and plastic jack-o-lantern buckets, to power armor, enemies, factions, food, chems, characters, and weapons, is familiar.Sure, it may be a bit overproduced, have some cheesy and weak CGI effects, and contain a lot of the ""modern formula"" in its script and story. Aside from that, it's got everything anyone would want for a riveting sci-fi, action, drama, comedy, horror adventure. Seriously, this show, like the game series, covers all the bases.And oh my goodness, mini fan-gush moment here, but, I was so excited to hear Matt Berry's voice, I was totally not expecting it, and it was an awesome cameo as one of the easily recognizable robots in the universe of Fallout. And let's just say his is not the only shocking and awesome cameo in the series. Fans of shows like Archer might be pleasantly surprised in Episode 6.What's also so cool, is that like the stories you run into in the game, there are a lot of really interesting plots with crazy twists. The vaults may seem more like a paradise than on the surface, but when you dig deep, sometimes, the vaults are scarier than reality under the sun...Fallout has been around for two and half decades, and it's taken them this long to finally come out with a tv/movie adaptation? You know what? Since they nailed it, I'd say it was worth the wait."
0	While the show has good moments and charactersthat shows a surface level understanding for the lore of the show, it is inexcusable to simply retcon the works of games you never worked on. Bethesda has deemed the arguably best three games in the entire Fallout Series (1, 2, and New Vegas) null and void for a show that nobody will remember in years time whenut inevitably does not get renewed for a second season. Who signed off on this garbage fire that accomplishes nothing more than spitting in the eyes of the loyal fans who have maintained the games Bethesda has abandoned through countless mods and fixes they never bothered to get around to.
1	I will make it short: the first five seasons are top-notch, and the show really entertained me during those years. In my opinion, it was always exceptional, the best of the best, and a new milestone in making a TV show. However, both Season 6 and 7 couldn't hold up to the level of the first five seasons. They were mostly made without source material from the book series, and this is very evident in the quality. Nevertheless, they were still okay. But Season 8 is a really bad thing and a steep drop in quality regarding storytelling. It's too blunt, too boring (because it's predictable), and there are too many mistakes that occur. There are just too many mistakes to ignore and not to notice. For example, mysteriously, half of the armies of the allies somehow survived the battle against the Night King and the undead to attack King's Landing. Following the shown battle against the Night King and his hordes, it looked like nobody but a very few survived. Not to mention all those bad strategic choices in battle and in preparation for the battle. Remember, Queen Dany had 8,000 unsullied soldiers only in the beginning - all those battles fought, not many should have been left. Also, the killing of the Night King is a rather poor choice of execution.Anyway, after season 6 gone were the times with many interesting characters, exotic places, and plots upon plots. Therefore, it is a good thing that season 8 was the last and the curtains will be closed for good. Also, I should add that I've lowered my hopes a lot for the upcoming prequel show. I fear we will get something rather ordinary and stupid: hopefully, Mr. Martin provides us with a better finale to his Game of Thrones. Last but not least: After the fall of Cersei and Daenerys, I bet there are enough bold (smaller) houses to deny a Brandon Stark the rule over the Seven Kingdoms. The wheel would not be stopped by his choosing, just a naive ending. All in all, it's a bad and just terrible ending to a - mostly - fantastic show. Last note: I thought I would buy all seasons on DVD, but instead, I sold the ones I already had.Ratings: Season 1 to 4 = 9 Season 5 = 8 Season 6 to 7 = 7 Season 8 = 3.
0	And instead, just presents a BLM view of this country. All good people are black, unfairly treated or even incarcerated, they care about their neighborhood, about other people and their feelings, ready to sacrifice themselves for others. White people are responsible, as represented by all white bad guys. It's badly written in some places which lowers its entertainment value, at least for me. Trivializing both police work and our problems it serves no one, exacerbating the very problems it aims to attract attention to in order to solve them. I'd give it a five, but only because I feel generous.
1	OK so this is definitely tongue in cheek hospital action/romance/comedy fare. Not to be confused with the likes of the brilliant House series which ticks all the boxes except the one Greys does best which is to be totally unrealistic in virtually every way. Greys is yet another PC cringeworthy show doing its best to cover every gender type possible for what reason? Brownie points? The first series to show the latest so called gender specific type zyxwv etc etc.... Don't know about you but it's not portrayed as interesting discovery but more like 'yeah I'm non binary so refer to me as they we or them' who gives a rats whatever! Anyway I digress. I enjoyed the first few seasons even putting up with the annoying Meredith Grey but alas as the seasons progressed the writing became more desperate as mentioned and quite silly. Worth a watch if you really have nothing else planned. Would have been a 7 but overall a 5 thanks to later seasons.
1	Seems like the bold and the beautiful.Just the clothes are different.Loved it before but I kind of forgot who lived and who died.
1	I have decided to watch this series because I recently heard various good opinions about the show. I'd like to believe that I watched it so you don't have to.In all honestly, it's based on some quite interesting plot: humans make contact with an alien species which then heads to Earth to colonize it. So what would humans do now?However, the rest is lacking on all levels. The dialogs are childish, the characters are dry - there's no connection with anyone, the story is rushed, the end... well, I won't say anything about the end in case you still want to see it.The only think this series excels at is diversity. Netflix outdone itself in this area. But seriously, are viewers in 2024 so naive to fall for a character that is a world-renown specialist in particle accelerators, can read the entire CERN software code in a couple of days, finds engineering solutions to space travel and many others. You can only laugh.But then again, this was written by D&D, who butchers GoT in the last seasons, so it all makes sense.
1	For a series with such a complexity, many-layered characters, contradicted emotions & breathtaking events. you'd expect to get an epic ending but that wasn't the case with Game of Thrones which has an end that ruined it all & made rewatchability almost impossible. even the worst pessimists wouldn't ever imagined a series that acquired all this glory & hype to end up so terribly.Shame on the writers to turn such a rich world & complicated structure into a pale & dumb pop-ish work at the last 2 seasonsSeasons 1-6 outstanding. season 7 that's when the dumb writing has begun. season 8 dumb writing has taken a whole new level, butchering all characters arcs & betraying the previous complexity of the world.if you're new to the series do yourself a favor & stop watching after season 6.
2	A brllliantly shot series - each scene is the work of an artist. Indeed, the cinmetography is a treat, each shot composed beautifully. Even though in black and white, it beautifully captures Italy's beauty.The story moves hauntingly, never letting up on suspense. There is some criticism that the series is too long - after all, others have told the same story in a far shorter movie. I haven't seen the other 'Ripley' movies and thus cannot compare this version with the previous ones. To me, except for a short flashback of Rome in early 1600s, nothing appeared unnecessarily dragged out.Each of the actors gave a fine account of themselves, and Andrew Scottt's performance stands out.
0	Really wanted to sympathise with the lead character..suppressed trauma can obviously make people act in very odd ways, not to mention skew, their deciding-making terribly. This guy..just lurches from one awful judgement-call to another.And just when you think he's found some kind of closure at the end of what can only be described as an awful ordeal which he had done so much to perpetuate with his appalling decision-making (or lack of), he goes back to the flat where he was raped and sits and chats with the man who raped him as if they're old friends. Then leaves and decides to listen to some of the voicemails his tormentor left him before she was jailed. This woman who had ruined his life. Smiling nostalgically as he does so.He's almost impossible to like.And considering he wants to make a living from comedy he's about as funny as toothache.A well-made series but it's rare I find myself feeling so antagonistic toward a character who has endured so much.
1	Fillion is funny as usual, but with some needed depth for this slightly more serious drama than Castle. But I really don't get why they thought they needed to pair him with an actress nearly 20 years younger than him. The plot with the captain outright telling him he wants to see him fail because of his age is very contrived. But there are redeeming aspects in the acting and interesting things they have to deal with as beat cops.
2	I've been a police officer for three years. I can completely relate to the story, regardless of the geographic region I work in. It has heart. It has spirit. This show has its flaws, but it's emotion is true and it overpowers the rest. This show has a realistic grounding, while still inspiring people like myself to do our best. I have now watched the pilot four times. I have yet to not cry during it. This show means something... beyond entertainment.
0	Casting choices that rely on stereotypes about China and Asians, along with an insistence on adhering to American political correctness and a focus on racial representation, often draw criticism for not authentically representing the diversity and complexity of cultures. This sentiment reflects broader discussions in the film and television industry regarding how cultures are portrayed and the importance of genuine representation. The industry is grappling with how to balance cultural authenticity with the demands of global audiences and the principles of inclusivity and diversity. Engaging with these discussions, filmmakers and producers are encouraged to consider more nuanced and respectful approaches to storytelling that honor the richness of all cultures without resorting to clichés or stereotypes.
1	Fallout could have been great. Could have been epic, but I can't help feeling they missed the boat. I think they made two huge mistakes in this series.First - they failed to introduce the world. As a fallout superfan I get it all but others won't. They will see silliness and zaniness without explanation and it will turn people off.They should have had the entire first season take place within the vault as a primer. Through that lens we could have learned about the vaults, the war and the surface. Raiders, ghouls, bottlecaps as currency, why the music is all 50s and all the retro things about fallout despite the advanced tech (laserguns drugs and food that doesn't spoil, why a stimpack heals her stab wound, etc). We could have learned about the world in an academic antiseptic way while having some tension within the vault as the season 1 story culminating with the opening of the vault door as the finale. That would make the jarring change between seasons real for the viewer just like it is for the protagonist as we see the differences between the book learning of the vault and the real world..Barring that at least 2-3 episodes in the vault doing the same. Everything feels so rushed in this telling.Second - they needed to tone DOWN the silliness of the games and take it slightly more seriously. Yes it can be a bit campy and such but slightly more muted than the games. Seems they went the other way instead.The writing is ok, the acting is ok, and so far the series is... well.. ok. Not great, not terrible. It could have been great.
2	A mesmerising series, hypnotic performance by Andrew Scott. Difficult to stop watching and before you know it you've watched several episodes and want to watch more. Being shot in black and white somehow adds to the intrigue. A long series (8) episodes but all good.Filmed in some beautiful places, perhaps the only time when you wished it was in colour, the locations are stunning, the buildings superb. Ridley's situation becomes increasingly complicated and he is constantly running away, digging himself even further into a series of lies and apparently believing more and more in the deceptions he has created.
0	"This and Oppenheimer.You take a bland script with all of its elements bland. 0/10.Then you add dramatic weird angles. +3 points of straight down.Make it black and white for no reason.And you've got your iMDB 8.5/10.This is how all ""cult"" classics are made. It worked 5 billion times before, it will work again. It seems to...It doesn't matter that the storytelling is incoherent.The characters are not explained.Most of the scenes are dull and pointless.The conversations are hard to follow.There's no substance to see after 2 episodes (I couldn't bear it anymore, I gave it fair chance_.It's as interesting as sitting on the toilet for 2 hours hoping that something else will happen.It doesn't.Just another example of stale, stifling unimaginative moviemaking.I made it to the 3rd episode somehow, so it gets 3 stars."
2	I love this show the first 4 seasons with the original cast were amazing I couldn't stop watching. When Isiah Washington and the other actor who played George left it slowed down a bit. Then it picked up around the 6-7 season. A song beneath a song was a beautiful episode, many hated it. I was a part of the fans who LOVED it! I cried, laughed and truly enjoyed watching the actors go past the element of just acting and showcase their musical talent. No they're NOT professional singers they're professional actors! So of course they're not going to give Adele a run for her money yet it was so nice to watch them, I enjoyed that episode so so much! Although I would've loved to have heard Sandra Oh sing as she did in a prior episode when she sung Virgin by Madonna and she actually has a nice voice. Other than that I cant wait to finish watching and catching up to the current season 13! Love love this show !!!!
1	What a blistering mistake putting that face of Gonzalez in this story. D&D had so many solid female leads to choose from in their GoT roster, they went with someone who has the acting range of Kristen Stewart because... what? They needed a pouty mouth? Is she schtupping a producer to get this role? They need to off this character ASAP to salvage this series. It's the only, and sadly major, distractor of the series. Otherwise their adaptation of the book is brilliant, although a deviation from the books they are more faithful to the Cultural Revolution drivers of the plot. Kudos for that. Special effects are solid.... it is interesting comparing this to the more faithful Tencent version from China... D&D appropriately cut out a LOT of chaff from the book.
0	I kept waiting and waiting and waiting, be patient they said,its worth it they said. Could very well be one of the worst series ever to grace my television. There was 15 minutes left and I had NO IDEA how it would end, none, zero.For me, it was so convoluted, I just lost interest but had to keep watching to see how it was going to end.Its beyond me how this series gets 8, 9 and 10 star reviews.40 years ago a Chinese woman agrees to aid the aliens, in the present, she IS aiding the aliens but they will not be here for 400 years BUT, one of the aliens in the form of an attractive woman is communicating with the humans via televisons, anywhere, anytime.The end of the series was NOT worth the wait, trust me.I obviously did not get it, like so many reviewers did.
2	This is insane. The story, the woman, every bit of it, just insane. Oh my god. There were so many moments that just made my blood boil.Somehow, This story is shockingly real, the show is written and produced by the guy this happened to. Even more shockingly, The actor who plays Donny, Richard Gadd, is the guy this stalking situation happened to! I cannot believe one could have the energy to write, produce, and act in a show based on one's own traumatic experience.Now, I get that Martha is sick, and the series made it clear that she needs help. However, I won't empathize with Martha. Don't confuse empathy with sympathy. Sure, Police/Institutions should learn many things from this Martha situation, and society should provide more resources to those with mental illness. Still, no, I don't empathize. Build many affordable therapy centers, then send her to them, permanently.
2	"3 Body Problem is a captivating sci-fi series that takes viewers on an exhilarating journey through space and time. Based on the acclaimed novel by Liu Cixin, the show masterfully combines intricate storytelling with stunning visuals to create an immersive experience unlike any other.From its thought-provoking exploration of physics and philosophy to its richly developed characters, ""3 Body Problem"" keeps audiences on the edge of their seats with its blend of mystery, intrigue, and awe-inspiring science fiction.The performances are top-notch, with each actor bringing depth and nuance to their roles, while the direction seamlessly navigates between past and present, weaving together multiple timelines into a cohesive narrative.While the show's complex themes may require some extra attention, its payoff is immensely rewarding for those willing to delve deep into its intricacies. Overall, ""3 Body Problem"" is a must-watch for any fan of intelligent, thought-provoking sci-fi storytelling."
2	"It is obvious that 3 Body Problem , which skillfully intertwines science and philosophy, will cause a difference of opinion. When I look at the comments, there are those who like it and those who criticize it. Even though I was hesitant at first, I liked it very much. The first few chapters move quite slowly. I think it was specifically designed this way to set the stage for the complex plot. If you are patient and continue with the series, it becomes increasingly interesting. There are technologically satisfying scenes and other heart touching ones. The characters are well portrayed.It is a production that I wish I had read the book first. There is also a 30-episode Chinese adaptation of the book called ""San - Ti"" that the audience liked it more but I plan to stick to the new version for now. It is said that the series will have approximately 7 seasons, I hope it will attract enough attention and continue."
0	I've written maybe 4 reviews on IMDB in my life and this had to be one of them because this show is garbage. Written by Someone who thinks of himself as Ian Fleming wannabe who is actually an incel. And direction is ridiculous. The inner monologue? Ridiculous.Colin Farrel looks incredible. I'll give him that. But shame on him for signing on to this garbage.The trite burns through this like Napalm. I never give up in TV and I could not make it even 3/4ths of the way through the FIRST episode. I thought for sure it would find its rhythm and I would see its value--lovely stylization and great cast--but it is absolute garbage. I can't.Feel free to disagree. I won't hold it against you. But, ladies, you have been warned.
2	"As a veteran of Fallout 1 and 2, I was very pleasantly surprised by this adaptation. Upon first viewing, my initial impression was ""a very solid six"", but, at the time of writing this review, that has grown to an eight. An intelligently set and presented main story, which is also elegantly and wittily served sharp criticism of run amok capitalism and profit-motivated existence. Typical Fallout toilet humor, perfect background music, striking post-apocalyptic locations, great cast ... although not completely without flaws (occasional banality and cheapness), this is certainly one of the best screen adaptations of a video game."
1	The gore scenes were tried to be childish, but they are not funny at all. In a certain scene, our character's finger is cut off, but the character does not react at all. Neither funny nor gore. There is a contrived and meaningless humour in series. Fallout doesn't need to be funny or childish. It is also quite pointless to completely delete the story in Fallout New Vegas. How did you find cold fusion? How do the characters live 250 years? While it could have told very nice topics, it turned into a meaningless story and it's a shame. Also, how come 3 characters constantly run into each other in this huge state? Are you too lazy to write logically?
1	Season 1 and 2 were great, season 3 i am choking on biased political agenda. Get enough of that on Social Media and on the news. I tried to muscle through but i can't even finish episode 3. I will not be continuing to watch this show if it is going to continue down this path.
0	What did you expect from Dumb & Dumber (murderers of GoT) ?This show can seem smart at first, but the more you think about it, the more you'll find it profoundly stupid.Those aliens make no sense at all. They were already slaughtering scientists before getting mad at Evans because of a stupid metaphor. By the way, they are using metaphors in their stupid game !Also, these aliens talk way too much. It's like in a video game, when you play badly on purpose, because you're bored and you want to lose.They're overpowered but they do nothing. They could wipe us out in a minute, but for some reason, they don't.There are so many stupid scenes in this show. For example, the infamous ship scene. They want us to believe there was no other way to do it. So stupid... Do you remember this James Bond movie that was mocked because Denise Richards played a nuclear scientist ? This is the same here. Of course our supermodel Eiza Gonzalez is a head researcher in nanotechnology. Of course she is.Also, it feels like the whole fate of the human civilization revolves around a group of young partygoers. They want us to believe these people are the top scientists on Earth, but they keep behaving like stupid teenagers. No one cares about their love stories.Seriously, don't bother...
2	Was great until recent political topics spending a lot of time checking off leftist agenda still a pretty good show hopefully it doesn't go woke and broke
1	There's still one episode left in season 8 but it'll be hard to redeem this season. It's an absolute mess that tears down everything it's built up to this point. The plots are cliche and lazy. Long running story arcs are thrown away and replaced by neat and tidy writing that's as safe as it is uninspired. What a disappointment and a sad end to a once great show.
1	Seasons 1 to 4 were masterpieces. No doubt they let Game of Thrones be deserving of its title as possibly the greatest tv series of all time. However, this was because the plot and story was not really written by the show's writers. These seasons largely followed George RR Martin's masterpieces (the books). The intrigue, the unpredictability, the deep-woven politics and calculated moves made by characters, the depth of the story, and atmosphere created was immense, and all helped create what it was; amazing.The quality of the series took a dip once the showrunners over-took the book. Many questionable events occured from season 5 onwards, however overall, the show was still relatively decent until season 7 started. I have intentionally left out any spoilers, hence im not going to list any of the numerous plotholes and stupid things which occured in any season after season 4.The Dorne plot was atrocious, and the complete out-of-character behaviour of many protagonists (especially Stannis) really made no sense.Season 7 was clearly rushed, and the writing of D&D had clearly reached its lowest. Or so we thought.Season 8 was by far the greatest disappointment in the history of television. Character arcs were completely disregarded, the main plot (the 'Winter is Coming' theme that had been drilled into our heads for 7 seasons) was pointless, main characters stories suddenly became irrelevant, all the history and lore of the GoT universe was thrown out the window and forgotten, terrible battle plans and tactics, the main characters protected by ridiculous plot armour, terrible disney-level dialogue, no depth to the story and the most ridiculous ending all add up to make this the biggest fall from grace in the history of TV & film.Dan and Dave (writers) could not be bothered to write a half-decent story to tie up George RR Martin's life work being converted to tv, and for that they should never be allowed on another set again. GRRM put his life into the books, and for the tv adaptation to be thrown down the drain is disgusting and a crime. Hang your heads in shame, D&D.Seasons 1-4: 10/10 Seasons 5-7: 5/10 Season 8: 1/10
0	"The UN security council should pass a binding resolution banning Benioff and Weiss from adapting anything ever again.I don't understand how you can take such a fascinating story and turn it into such an uninspiring snoozfest. I really rarely use the D-word but in this case ""disappointing"" doesn't even come close to describe the overall experience of watching this mess.The characters are all abundantly silly. The absolute nerds in the original book were transformed into the cliché: ""strong and independent"" women. Why? Their vulnerability was what made them special and the story interesting.The plot moves at a snail's pace.The dialogues are ChatGPT-esque. It was as if someone fed it pages from the novel and said ""hey, turn this into a dialogue in a script I'm writing for Netflix""."
0	The final episode made me wish I'd never started watching the series. Save the time and the disappointment, it's not worth feeling how I feel now.
2	I do not care about ads or previous makes and models of this show. I do not care about the inconsistencies with the Portuguese and English, that's crazy! Trust the high ratings, but you have to be into this genre of content. It's made for history lovers with good taste. The show is awesome, plain and simple. It is both captivating and inspiring, so if you came to be entertained then you came to the right place. Acting is so beyond phenomenal I don't remember the last time I was this hooked to a show and angry after every episode because I wanted more. It's very obvious this show was never even intended to be 100% historically accurate but it's so congruent to the factual narrative that it's just so damn good.
1	I did not know what to expect when I started watching Baby Reindeer, I definitely was not disappointed though. As each episode transpires you are riveted by the fact that this is based on a true story, which makes even more shocking. The acting is fantastic, Jessica Gunning as Martha was fascinating, one minute you despised her, the next you pitied her. Her ability to shift her emotions was amazing. It really is a screwed-up story of a warped co-dependency and being completely lost and messed up emotionally from trauma. It also explores the continual self-flagellation Richard Gadd as Donny puts himself through in the quest for fame. I was probably a little let down by the final episode, but well worth the watch.
1	I was really looking forward to a great sci-fi series. With a fascinating plot and it certainly started that way. There was a real mystery around the events but it soon turned into q teenage drama. I do not understand the ount of screen tim3 given to Will and his sad story. Or his love triangle with Jin and the handsome Indian Admiral. It wasn't even interesting. It was sad and just pointless. Almost.all the characters are annoying, pompous brats. None of them feel like accomplished scientists. It was just disappointing to watch. After the first few episodes I had to skip forward. The plan they come up with is also pretty boring and nonsensical. I would watch the first 5 episodes and then read the rest on Wikipedia.
2	I just recently rewatched the series because my husband had never seen Game of Thrones. I wanted to watch HOTD and he was feeling left out, so I decided we should get him into GOT so he would understand more when watching HOTD. So we binged seasons 1-8. And all this did for me was remind me how angry I am with what they did. Just why? There's nothing I can say that every other review hasn't said, I just needed somewhere to put these words. Knowing how everything ends and ends so abruptly with no storytelling - which becomes even more painfully obvious when you binge everything in a 3 week timeframe, just makes all the earlier seasons almost not even worth rewatching. Such a disappointment. I'm still upset. It's been years. I know I need to move on lol. Luckily, HOTD has been pretty good, I like where the story is going but the time jumps kind of get to me. Hopefully that doesn't continue now that we've reached the beginning of the dance of the dragons.
0	Loved the past two seasons of the Rookie. This season is unwatchable. The fun has been drained from this show and now it is just a woke lecture. Hoped for the best after the first two but couldn't get through the third episode. Taking it off my recording list. Watch the first two seasons if you haven't tried out the show.
1	"The start of this show is fresh. The experience of getting to know traditional Japanese culture one by one is attractive. But when I get used to that unfamiliarity and awkwardness, I realize that this show's main dish is delayed too much.The main characters are always stuck somewhere. They're stuck in Osaka at the beginning and in a small fishing village from the middle. Most of the conversation is ""Just don't do it"". It feels like being controlled by every action in a Japanese master's restaurant.It's not good to use an entire season for a build-up. I don't know how much bigger story remains in this show's future, but I'm definitely disappointed with the performance of this season itself."
2	"+ ""Fallout"" is a fun series that definitely gets better in later episodes (episode 4 is what did it for me). The overall design and scenery is immaculate and seriously astoundingly well made. A lot of scenes seem to be filmed in actual locations which is a big plus as well. Overall the story is engaging and the acting is great.Unfortunately there are many scenes that happen clearly because the writers need them to happen at that point with the only guiding force being happenstance.Smn listens in at exactly the right time to hear exactly what the audience needs to hear, smthn is discovered only because it needs to be discouvered no matter how likely it is; every main character is basically on the same path because it needs to be that way, it felt quite forced and almost rushed at times which unfortunately reduces the quality of the show overall for me.That said, the fact that I still gave it an 8 should tell you that all the rest is very well done and well worth a watch. I hope future seasons can do away with so many ""random teammeetings"" and ""perfect timings"" to ground it a little more in a 10/10 for me."
0	Seasons 1 and 2 are worth the watch, but season 3 has really dropped the ball here.It's clear the show-runners have decided Season 3 will focus on educating viewers of political talking points, which would be fine if it was subtle about it and if it didn't detract from the show we know from seasons 1 and 2.Unfortunately it fails both of those tests.Episode 3 update: Same deal. It's like I'm watching clips from /r/AmIFreeToGo but it's a TV show.
0	Skipped several episodes in season three, hoping for the magic of seasons one and two to manifest again.Sadly, season three severely disappointed.It's okay for a make believe cop show to have themes and subtext, as long as the stories keep viewers immersed.Once the make believe strays too far from reality, viewers like me start imagining the cameras and the table of writers and execs parsing each of line of dialogue to ensure there won't be a boycott of the show.Once the messaging looks like it's going to slap you in the face, you hold up your hands defensively. Once the messaging actually connects with your face, you do what any sane person does and leave the situation.The magic is gone.
0	I can be short about this. The first episodes are promising science fiction about an alien civilisation which makes contact with Earth and are heading towards our planet. But than after a few episodes which make you curious about what's going to happen and make you want te see more it just becomes a lot of scenes of endless and endless conversations between the group of friends.SPOILER ALERT: you will not see any alien nor alien civilisation in the the last episodes.Sometimes it just looks like the writers of this serie just didn't know how to follow up the first episodes and just end up in a lot of talking and talking and talking.
2	"This is an amazing show and it is the first that I have actually watched continually. The difference in the characters' attitudes and the comedy and the drama make it a great show. The plot of this series is never really obvious, making it addicting to watch every Thursday night. I think that the thing that has gotten so many people hooked on it is that it's not just about the patients in the hospital and their problems, but about the people that work at the hospital and their relationships and their personal lives. Without that feel to the show, it would just be like ""Scrubs"" or ""ER"". I have been very impressed with Season 3 and hope the show continues for a long while."
0	I'm dissapointed, A family show with a strong moralizing message, simple moral dilemmas. Comic-book characters, weak jokes, predictable plot. LA Police Propaganda. Maybe there were a few better episodes. The rest was very poor.
1	"Most of the characters in this series are insufferable. They are arrogant, spoiled, obnoxious brats. Both the old and the young. Their dialogue swings between sappy and on the nose by the sentence. But, there's good news. I found that I could fast forward through most of the interpersonal 'filler' and suffer no loss of story progress.This is one of those shows that thinks it's smarter than it is. A good example is the shows idea of 'innovation.' The propulsion system proposed in the show is seen by other researchers as 'ground-breaking.' But, in truth, this technique has been used in a number of sci-fi properties for years, and even presented visually on screen.At one point one of the characters mentioned that they're going to go watch Rick and Morty. And the Rick and Morty reference made me laugh at the program, since this show seems well aligned for that crowd. It's not 'actually' smart, but plays like it is. That is this series in a nutshell.It's probably enough material for a movie, but stretched to 8 hours, it quickly becomes laborious to watch.I'd describe the series as ""ok."" I don't understand the hype behind it. Actual science is very difficult to understand at times. But, at no time was this hard to follow in the least. Dumbed down? Yes. Just dumb? Maybe."
1	The pacing of the first episode is too fast.With four or five storylines running concurrently, it's a mess. If Tencent's Three-Body version is criticized for slow pacing, then Netflix's version is like rushing to catch a train, leaving no breathing space, and characters are merely pushed along by the plot. The constant switching between multiple storylines and the introduction of so many characters in the first episode would be confusing for anyone who hasn't done their homework. Even with the scientific explanations cut, I doubt Western audiences could understand what the first episode is trying to say.If the last two episodes were cut and the content of the first two episodes were expanded, the viewing experience would definitely improve significantly. Alternatively, adding two more episodes for a total of 12 might suffice, but with only eight episodes covering everything from Ye Zhetai to the Wallfacer Project, how could it not feel rushed?
0	I was really really enjoying the show and gave up after episode 7. That's right i was not even bothered to see the final episode, and the reason is that i read it didn't end and that there is likely to be a second season in 2026. Absolutely not bothered because i know i'll just be bitterly disappointed. Inventing Anna did this to me, i was so invested and at the end was like what am absolute waste of time that was.At the end of episode 7 which had a whole lot of personal interplay and little main story development i was left wondering how they would wrap it up in the finale, but alas they don't. I'm out.
2	"This show offers a realistic view of how rookie police officers deal with their daily routine. As a child raised in a family of law enforcement professionals, this show is the closest representation of how the characters deal with work, colleagues and relationships. The characters in the show seem real and have issues of their own.Nathan Fillion as the lead is tremendous in his role of Rookie Officer Nolan. He brings his innate charm to the role of a downtrodden man that seeks to find meaning in his life by joining the police force. There is heart in his performances and that becomes the conduit through which the audience can empathize and sympathize with him and the more jaded police officers of the show. His signature brazen attitude is toned down compared to his role in Castle or his Captain Mal from Firefly. In the more somber moments of the show you can see that Officer Nolan has pain in his heart and has been through rough times, but he champions through it. That's where Fillion does his best work.The rest of the cast also does a great job, but there are the unavoidable stereotypes. The three main actors orbiting Fillion are Richard T. Jones as Sergeant Grey, the sergeant that doesn't like Nolan because he's too old to be a cop, trying to crush his morale in hopes that he will either quit or be a better officer for it. His performance is solid and the chemistry between him and Fillion is palpable. The little side-eyes and moments of silence are awkward but fun to watch as you root for Nolan but also understand Sergeant Grey's viewpoint.His trainer, officer Bishop played by Afton Williamson, is a tough officer that's overly ambitious and sees Nolan as an opportunity to get to the detective seat faster. She is his anchor in the show, pulling Nolan down to reality. There are glances in the show that are done very expertly and subtly by Williamson, where you as the audience realize that she actually begins to admire and respect Nolan. That humanizes her character and makes her likable.Melissa O'Neil portrays rookie Lucy Chen, who is romantically involved with Nolan. She is initially presented as a badass rookie that has a take charge attitude. O'Neil is very believable as that character and her chemistry with Fillion is great. However, her chemistry with Eric Winter's character as her trainer, Officer Bradford, is what helps the character stand on her own and not just as the romantic interest. She is constantly challenged and belittled by Bradford who is jaded but sincere in his desire to make her the best officer she can be. I liken his character to that of John C. McGinley's Dr. Cox from Scrubs.So far this shows sets itself apart from the current ""cop dramas"" on tv. Shows like Magnum PI, Lethal Weapon and NCIS tend to sensationalize how crime fighting is done. The Rookie doesn't shy away from law enforcement lingo and spouting regulations, but it is not done to glamorize how roguish or cool the lead characters are. In fact, Officer Nolan and his fellow rookies learn from each episode what it means to be a better officer."
2	Richard Gadd who plays the lead character of Donny is extremely charismatic and natural that it's impossible for any viewer to not follow his story, regardless of the theme!I'm not sure about the ratio of dramatic effects vs. Real life depictions in this show, however it's pretty devastating to see all the horrible events that he has experienced and at the same time quite encouraging to see his success at the end of his ordeal.Having said the above, something that this story is missing is delving a little deeper or at least providing critique for cultural nuances of why he had such a conservative attitude to sexuality that made him vulnerable? Why he was goading the stalker at times? Or even, why the stalker needed to stalk?Looking at the social behaviours in UK from a Scandinavian perspective, it seems that British social norms are more based on saving face(fakery) than brutal honesty!For example, it can be said that Donny was providing space for the stalker to continue stalking only on the basis that he wanted to be seen as polite!?That is a mind boggling approach to go along with different rather life altering situations and experiences since you can't just say No! Donny's excuse with various characters who harmed him could be that he just wanted to be polite/people pleaser!?As I see Scandinavian people tend to be direct even though seen as harsh, cold, etc., it seems that the main character's problems were more rooted in his social values(people pleasing,etc) than just another person's actions.
2	Completely unfamiliar with the video game, have followed Wade's career however, and as usual he delivers carrying the heart and soul of the series.No spoilers here.Good old fashioned classic tale, sorta Good vs. Evil, but who actually are the good guys or the bad guys?The authors do a great job engaging their politics within the scenery set designs and experiences of the individual characters as opposed to preaching and ramming silliness down the viewers throats.They present a most unforgiving world, which removes a lot of modern silly wokeness and pronouns when survival is the base necessity... They show that stuff gets tossed to the wayside... in season 1 anyhow.. This Allows the viewer to make up their own inferences and ideas as the story kinda S L O W L Y unfolds.Yes, I get it... ya'll be watchin' and flippin' through your phones... but the story eventually begins to move along and percolate nicely, into a good old mystery...Gorgeous set designs and use of classic music in the first few episodes to beautifully exemplify the disparity of their past vs. The future we and they are presented with... The entire production is beautifully stylized, the film, the costumes, the plot oh MY!Every detail in their world is superbly presented which makes the world presented believable!Every actor do their characters justice.. all skilled, from bit players to scene stealers, they give their characters depth and we can feel their desperation in such an unforgiving world.Ate season one UP like popcorn!!Looking forward to an engrossing story line, so sit back, open your mind and get carried away into a fun filled action packed distopia!Rod Sterling would be proud!
0	Why Netflix?Why you changed my beautifully written book for the whole humanity? Why you changed the characters? What kind of casting is that (Jess Hong and J Pryce are great but)? Hey producers: why you are stuck with clichés? Are you afraid of the universality of the book? Why you don't keep the core of this cleverly written book? Why you use this book to make unnecessary propagandas (I'm from mass media, sorry)? Again, why you are not loyal to the book which is way more ahead than your prejudices? Why you don't see the whole world? As a hard-core sci fi lover from Europe I'm very upset. You have budget to do everything yet you keep on using these stories to condition minds... Narrow minds. One sided views...
0	I don't know if they're running out of ideas or what, but the show has gone steadily downhill to a point where I can't watch any more. I binged this show multiple times and this season (14) is just the worst. I don't care about the characters anymore. The new ones are boring. And good grief people need to keep politics OUT of shows. It's progressively getting worse and what was once my favorite now makes me angry. So, I recommend the earlier seasons for sure, but stop before here. I wish I had.
0	How... How can you prepare us for this moment for over 7 seasons and end it like that? HONESTLY? Arya killing the White King like that? pfff... what a joke.
2	Initially, I thought this might be a sequel or prequel to Castle, a show I enjoyed in the past. However, this series surpassed my expectations and even the success of Castle, I believe.It's perfect for viewers of all ages who enjoy a blend of action, drama, and comedy. While there are some episodes with less storytelling depth, the subsequent ones usually make viewers forget about any shortcomings.The show boasts well-developed and diverse characters, along with great humor. However, I'm still waiting for a more intricate conclusion to the overarching story.Looking forward to the upcoming seasons (currently in its fourth), hoping they maintain the same level of enjoyment, making it suitable even for family viewing.
0	With this billed as Netflix no.1 and all the positive reviews, to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. Truth be told, I was bored in parts and found it dragged in places. Sadly, I didn't need the large quantities of tissues I was advised to buy. Yes, it was a sobering tale but I kept wondering why Donny let it go on. There were shades of Stockholm syndrome and mutual dependence. The acting was outstanding, Jessica Gunning being a tour de force, but it just didn't do it for me. As this is based on a true story, how difficult it must have been for the writer to bare his soul like this.
2	I've watched the first three seasons of Grey's anatomy within four weeks and it took me by surprise. The first season started up alright and interesting, but it was clear that the characters had not been developed yet.They were somewhat rigid and not always easy to get used to. This flaw was well compensated in the second season, when, in my opinion, the show really hitted off. From that point on, it became the strong soapy drama which it has been till now. The characters were presented in a broader sense, the story lines took me on stronger than before and the great acting lifted the whole series up a notch.Or even two. In my opinion, season two was the best out of the three and especially the cliffhanger of the second season was excellent. Season three was somewhat different, in the way that the traditional story lines settled down a bit more then before. This resulted in a sometimes completely different perspective then I was used to with this series and in all honesty, was not always satisfactory. However, this show has not been dull one moment and the damage is done; you're so much in love with the characters that you simply want more then you already have. If you liked the interrelationships between the characters of -for example- ER, you'll like this.The medical cases are nice, but not the most interesting within the range of medical series.The drama is what should take you on and if it does, you'll see a series with excellent acting, nice story lines and an addictive setting. If you add that up with the superb mix of soap themes and strong, well acted drama you'll know that this show holds a promising future and is well worth the investment of your time.
0	Except the effects, this series is pure garbage. Storytelling, action, characters, everything is faulty and amateurish.I really have never seen something so badly made, it's a sort of slapstick farce enhanced by technology.Nothing links with anything, there is a obscure, barely discernable plot going on, the characters have no real motivations, the action flow is fractured and twisted without reason, in fact one could analyze this piece of crap on how not to assemble a drama of any kind.Now it has a 8.6 IMDB rating. This is atrocious.Felt the need to log in here to write this even though I don't do reviews here.Watch it on your own cost, if you assign zero value to your personal time.
2	I have enjoyed this series from the very start. It is nice to have only a few main key characters to follow - allowing them the chance to have more in-depth story lines outside their hospital duties. Whilst some of the couplings were easy to see coming others weren't. Nice twist with Addisons former lover reappearing to re-win her affections only for him to make a pass at Meredith. The most unexpected for me is that of George & Callie. The last few episodes here in the UK have had me screaming at the TV that they cant end there.... The episode ending with Preston shot down outside the hospital and the following one - pure genius. Izzys love triangle with the almost dying Danny and the sometimes annoying Alex only add to the romantic intrigue. These mixed with the weekly medical cases of varying severity make the show a mix of drama romance and light black comedy. Loved the episode with the unexploded bomb in the patients chest cavity - it was great television. I only wish it was on terrestrial TV here in UK - I rave about it to work colleagues and they don't have Cable so are really missing out. Keep it up for many seasons to come....
0	"The enormous flaws in the show are immensely obvious. Surgeons are seen doing everything in patient care from diagnosis to running tests, MRIs and followup care.Surgeons don't do this! Diagnosis is done by a physician who refers someone for surgery. The Chief of surgery doesn't run the hosiutal, an administrator does. Technical professionals run tests. Most patient care is done by nurses.The doctors carpool as if they don't make $500,000+ per year.Worse, the female doctors seem to be unaware of this thing called ""birth control"" because they are sexually active and getting ""surprise"" pregnancies.It's crap."
0	I don't think the director understands that his viewers are Human and not monkeys 🐵. Plenty of mistakes and not a clear story line. Don't waste your time, its just another show
0	The suspense, the knife edge cliffhanger, the building of anticipation of 'will it/won't it happen'.....none of it happened.I watched this series, excited about the link to GOT and maybe that's where I went wrong. I should have remembered how much of a flop season 8 of GOT was, the season that wasn't written by the original author. 3 body problem just highlights how much of a genius George R R Martin really was/is and not much of GITs success was down to Benioff and Weiss. Just so underwhelming.I expected much more from 3 body problem, but instead we just got static scenes, with GOT actors playing stiff characters. Can't say I'm excited for another season.
1	Take an 11/10 series and give it one bad episode that completely disregards every narrative and character arc established and built upon over the last 8 years and you go from being on top of the world to being disposable trash. I can't in good faith give this show a 1/10, even though that would be accurate to how it ended, but MOST of this show is fantastic. They just completely threw it away at the last possible moment, for apparently no good reason other than shock and subversion.
0	Season 3 is terrible. Unbearable.no story line no direction.
1	It was the greatest until season 8 destroyed everything
1	What else can I say. They should have dragged it out to build the suspense and come up with some better ideas to end it.
1	Tom Ripley is meant to be young and ambitious. He leaves his dark and dreary life to drink in the colourful world of the wealthy. But in this sorrowful reimagining, he is a middle-aged man who looks like a serial killer and shows an utter lack of normal human emotion. He leaves a crummy life in NYC to go to an equally colourless version of Italy (which is usually a rich tapestry of colour). No one would be taken in by this version of Tom who reads as immediately creepy. And unlike the Hollywood movie with Matt Damon and Jude Law, there is no chemistry between the two male leads. So, the motive of Tom feeling misled by Dickie about the nature of their relationship is nonexistent. It just comes off as guy randomly offing another guy who barely tolerates him: a dispassionate crime. And dispassionate is how I would describe the whole show. But somehow for others, the bland acting and backdrops seem to pop. Maybe they think people like me are missing the point. That's all right because I'd counter the emperor has no clothes!
1	A very interesting sci-fi series, adaptation of Liu Cixin's novel (I was shocked to found that Wandering Earth is also based on his work).In brief, this is about the human's race to save their future from an alien species which wants to make earth as their new home.I liked the mystery of first 5 episodes, the way it was build. And then the actual drama begins, which focuses more on character's life and their conversation on loosing friends, messed up relationships 😟. It's all build up for final episode and it pays off!Everything aside, it was the WOW-signal which clicked me 😂, direct reference of real life incident. You know if you know, old Nat-Geo Discovery nerds 😉.Though the series is great but I would prefer to read the book, because the scale of the story was feeling larger but from the series pov it was not that big.
0	If you enjoy the series, do NOT read the books. It will forever taint the fondness you have for the adaptation.If you read the books, be prepared to be disappointed. They've made so much detrimental and unnecessary changes to the source materials often at the spirit and core of the books.They've truncated a lot of the main characters by merging several characters into one. Naturally, we have the usual hollywood race and gender swap. Some of the roles and plots doesn't appear until the later books all got mashed together in one season and one character.The worst transgression is: The trilogy was always about the bigger picture and have equal focus on the science and the characters. This adaptation put way too much emphasis on the characters as if it was GOT or the walking dead when it's a completely different theme and scope.There are already enough complexity in the plot with the science, but they thought it was a good idea to unnecessary add teenage high school like drama to the adaptation.Take for example, Salazar. One of the worst written character in recent history. Always emotional, to the point of threatening physical violence to one of her friend's jabs. And she was supposed to be a brilliant scientist, just watch her and ask yourself when is the last time you see ANY female scientist irl talk like her and as emotionally unstable as her?After watching this series I'm convinced D&D is incapable of writing anything good by themselves and only get carried by the works of others with genuine brilliance.
2	SEASON: 8.0 I recently finished binge-watching the first season of Ripley, and it's a refreshing take on a classic character. In a world of reboots and remakes, it's nice to see something done differently and done well.Based on Patricia Highsmith's novels, Ripley takes us on a twisted journey through the mind of a sociopathic conman. Andrew Scott is absolutely mesmerising in the title role. Sure, he may be playing the character at a much older age than in the source material, but he brings an oddly enticing complexity to the role that's downright captivating.Steven Zaillian's writing and direction ensure a consistent tone throughout each episode, and the decision to present the series in black and white only adds to its allure. Some may find it controversial, but personally, I think it marries well with the period setting, giving the show a timeless quality.Now, I'll admit, Ripley doesn't shy away from violence, so if you're squeamish, this may not be the show for you. And the pace? Well, let's just say it's extremely deliberate. Some may find it a bit glacial at times, but personally, I found it added to the tension and suspense.Overall, Ripley is a compelling and stylish thriller that's sure to keep you hooked from start to finish. If you're a fan of dark, character-driven dramas, do yourself a favour and give it a watch. With stellar performances, gorgeous cinematography, and a gripping storyline, it's one ride you won't want to miss.FORMAT: StreamingVIDEO: 10.0 Native 2160/24p streaming presentation Detail level: Excellent Colour reproduction: Excellent Level accuracy: Excellent Encode: Excellent Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 10.0 Dolby Atmos streaming audio Dialogue reproduction: Excellent Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent Dynamics: Excellent Surround sound presentation: Excellent LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 8.0.
2	I have had people telling me for years to watch greys anatomy and I'll be honest, I have just kept thinking no thanks. Another medical show? I think I'll keep scrolling and watch something decent. Wow, was I wrong.I have only been watching a few weeks and it has taken over my life. Any spare minute I get is devoted to this show and already I am on series 8.This show has me invested in a way that is very rare. You genuinely care and root for the characters and it writes characters in a way that can make you love them after 20 mins of an episode. That's not to say that they ate not flawed though. I have gone back and forth on loving Alex and hating Alex more times than I can count.This show also has the ability to turn you inside out. Never before have I cried so much. When Denny died I texted my friend to tell her how it destroyed me. Her response? Just you wait.The character development and plot lines are exciting and engrossing and sometimes maddening but I absolutely love this show and it's characters. I am so obsessed with it that I cannot stop watching. I will have to slow down though because I think I will be quite lost when it's finished.My fave episodes so far: The train crash where the two people get impaled together.The shooting episodes in the hospital The bomb in the guys abdomen episode The one where George diesBest relationships in the series so far: Lexie and mark Torres and Arizona Miranda and Ben.Best Friendships Mark and Torres Miranda and derek shepherd Meredith and Cristina.
2	There's probably nothing that can be said today that hasn't been said about Game of Thrones that should be news. Everything that you have heard about the show - from the wonderful visual effects, to the set design, the cinematography, the beautiful score to the acting - holds true till the very end. In that regard, this show (as of the writing of this review) is the benchmark and it'll be hard to get toppled over. The talented directors and writers over this 8 year period gave us a fantasy epic which has become a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon that will forever remain a huge part of many people's lives, and for that I am grateful.The final season has just wrapped up, and unfortunately the show's legacy is now going to be two-fold. There was a time when people clamored to find out how Game of Thrones was going to conclude, a time where people were anxious because a show of this magnitude ending would leave a void in people's hearts that would be hard for any show to fill, a time where it seemed like this show was going to legitimize itself as *the* greatest show of all time. However, due to the nature of its conclusion, that is no longer the case. Game of Thrones is going to be remembered as quite possibly the greatest show with the greatest crashing of an ending.The biggest issue of the series is going to come down to poor writing, poor pacing, and lack of episodes as it approached its final seasons. Season 7 and 8 represent mixed bags of goodies. You can tell what the goal of each big moment was and as a fan and I was all down for it. I'm not going to spoil what these moments were because i'd like new comers to not get deterred away from the massive onslaught by fans right now, but the thing to take away from this is that there's a significant dip in character arcs and there are choices that are made that just don't work because there was not enough time to execute them properly. I'm sure in the minds of the writers, they made sense because they have probably had in-depth discussions with each other about where each character is going to end up, but translating that to screen with fewer episodes where everything seems so overwhelmingly rushed skips the integral moments that help let the audience come along this journey. The pace at which the last two seasons have progressed contains frankly enough content to make at least 20 episodes, rather than just hastily putting it all in 13. We've received a conclusion that falls flat because it wasn't properly built up and earned. It's an ending which, while may represent the actual book ending, does not work for the direction the show was leading into.All in all, I love Game of Thrones. It's still going to be up there regarded as one of the best series ever for good reason. It's just extremely disappointing and disheartening to witness the route it took towards the end which made it seem like the writers wanted to end the show as soon as possible (whether it be to work on other projects, or they simply did not really know how to expand it). It's going to leave the fanbase divided, but I hope over time people focus more on the good we got rather than the bad - because this show still deserves it.
2	I have been waiting for this since i watched the trailer.I am old enough to remember the original series with Richard Chamberlain in the 80's.Never read the book so cannot say if this version or the 80's one is true to it but from the first episode i am sucked in.The scenery/cgi and period costumes are great and i like that the Japanese are speaking Japanese with subtitles as i enjoy things in their original languages. Shame the Portugese speak English but its a minor thing.The lead actors are great(I especially enjoy Hiroyuki Sanada's work)and the English cursing always amuses my childish self.Anyway i am looking forwrd to the rest of the episodes.
0	I don't know what I was thinking trusting these boys after what they did with GoT. They've done it again. Taken a reputable IP and butchered it beyond recognition. However, perhaps that was the goal, to appeal to Western audiences, but in doing so - and whilst visuallly impressive, I think they've ended up with a worse adaptation of the overall story.If you've read the books, this Netflix version is abysmal. It completely missed the existential dread and cosmic horror of the books. Nevermind changing races and locations of characters, mixing characters from different generations?! Bizarre.If you haven't read the books, it's just OK. They've stripped down so much of what made the story compelling and present it as flat as possible. Disappointing.
0	Started really good the first two seasons but after that it gradually gets worse and worse for every season. Season 6 has started horrible. The poor acting or should I say overacting is terrible but the writing/story is even worse. Everything that happens is unbelievable stupid and not at all relatable or believable. To much drama for even the slightest bit of problem and to much problems happens to the characters both in their private lifes and in their work. The wedding episode in the beginning of season 6 forced me to stop watching because all the overacted drama happening and everything went wrong over and over again so it was just pathetic. Just painful to watch. I know it's American but this even to stupid for Americans to watch. I hope it gets better as I'm still to curious about what will happen to stop watching but I doubt it will.
0	I'd rate season one and two, 8 and 7, respectively. I'm a Fillion fan, and police procedurals are okay in general. But there are caveats with those procedurals. The original NCIS is one of the few series that has avoided deteriorating into a soap opera about people in uniform.Alas, The Rookie show runners chose to focus on the young attractive cast and their personal lives instead of mystery and criminal plotlines. The problem is that most of the supporting cast aren't ready for their moment in the sun. Afton Williamson, who played Nolan's Training Officer left the show early on, citing sexual harassment (by a recurring guest star). Her departure hurt the show. She and Fillion had good chemistry, and her character was well written. There was more grittiness in other roles early on as well. That rough edged texture was exchanged for melodrama and romantic shenanigans. Bradford is now a goofy beefcake stereotype, instead of a seriously conflicted T. O. And the scripts putting regular duty cops in SWAT type situations is frankly ridiculous. Characters with emotional and psychological liabilities (officer Chen are you listening?) are frequently put in key positions, only to predictably fail, or develop near superhuman abilities (officer Harper) that make them a hero.Season three is when the wheels came off. It is so bad that you would actually have to watch it yourself to believe how uncomprehendingly bad it is. It was produced during a period when BLM and police malfeasance were under a microscope. The scripts became focused on white supremacy, with even Nolan (Fillion's character) being forced into sensitivity training for unconscious racial bias. Hey, one episode, maybe even two, but an entire season?The end of season three was a convoluted mess, but featured the end of one of the least effective characters, thankfully so.At that point the plots got insanely ridiculous. One of the team becomes the psychological muse/political pawn of a female drug cartel leader? And when the team crashes a warehouse filled with gang members, the team actually shushes them, instead of shooting or restraining them. I. Am. Not. Kidding.Once we get into season five it's all soap and crazy master criminal plot lines. Silly stuff really.Then they spun off an even sillier series, The Rookie Feds. I can't even begin to describe how bad that was, except to say... it was canceled after one season.
0	I used to love this show over the years. There were high notes and boring episodes, but you always knew that Game of Thrones would deliver in the end. Everybody would get what's coming for them.Until Season 8, Episode 3. The big finale the show has been building up to for eight seasons. Winter had come.And Winter left again. In one episode. One incredibly boring episode of pointless fighting that had the artistic greatness of a low-budget Xena fight scene.And then it was over. Eight seasons of bloodletting, plotting and scheming were thrown away in a single episode.Thats what Game of Thrones is now. A hollow shell of its former glory, because now we know whats inside. Now we know whats behind every curtain.Nothing but a tiny dagger to the heart.
2	No matter how many characters die or leave this show , this show holds you till the last gasping breathe.This show is a whole combo of medical drama with romantic stories and yes at many instances it tells you that no matter what happens in life , life must go on. Best part is every character is having a significant role in this . Be it Meredith Grey , Mark, Derek Shepherd, Christina , Callie or Arizona every role has been beautifully carved . New characters come , old characters leave but this show never ever bores you.Every episode has its own plot twist and a new learning for life.No you don't need to love medicine to watch this show !!!Watch 1st episode and i guarantee you , you will fall in love with this show ...Happy watching Grey's Anatomy!!!!
0	Not like the tv Chinese adaption, Netflix is mixing up the storylines from all books and displayed that in the first season.No deep story lines!!!No real explanations!!!The core of the books is missing, and what makes them interesting!!!Storylines are also mixed up an changed, and not to the better...!I read the books and am very disappointed.After seeing the Netflix version I LOVE the Chinese series adaption.I watched it with a friend, who not read the books. And she had also big ??? And thought it was all rushed and not really good.In short: read the books.Or watch the Chinese version.
0	I'm not in favor of cutting creative freedom, but selling a period film with so many story inaccuracies (Torunaga didn't even exist...................... .......) Then, combined with a total historical inaccuracy, the contradiction. On the one hand we have Japanese speaking Japanese, English speaking English and Spanish (Portugal's allies since when?!?!?) speaking Spanish. On the other hand, we have Portuguese speaking... everything but Portuguese.Finally, like the nail in the coffin, reinventing something is doing it better, especially when it is said to be the new Game of Thrones. The lack of a Portuguese character (who is empathetic to us) that makes up the chess game that was the Japan of Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu kills me. Now I understand what the Chinese and Russians feel when they watch American films...
2	"Just finished watching it and since the first episode I had these positive vibes that we are going to have a good series which we might really ""like"" and it did capture our inner sci-fi senses.The whole series with all the characters are really good even the last launching to meet the aliens mechanism can be logical in the sci-fi field and to be honest I did not find one episode that I did not like which is usually the case you have 8 episodes and you get one or even two that you say it was not related.My probably the problem with it was the ending which definitely needs a season 2 and even 3 and honestly I can't wait to watch season 2 just to see how they would cross the 400 years mark and meet the aliens it is kind of complicated but worth it.Go watch if you haven't already did."
0	Why has Jenna Dewan become a main character on The Rookie? She appears at every incident the police appear. She doesn't do anything except be on camera. She's a horrible actress and doesn't seem to have any role except the girl friend of The Rookie.
0	Trying to make an artistic impression with black and white was a huge mistake when filming on the Amalfi Coast, Naples and, to a lesser extent, Rome. The film (or I should say TV show) looks sterile and flat, as if it was shot on an iPhone then edited to a B&W filter.The acting is equally pale. Andrew Scott as Ripley is passable, but aside from the Italian character actors (who are fine) the other performances are self-consciously flat. Worst is the part of Freddie Miles - a fantastic character-acting opportunity as evidenced by Philip Seymour Hoffman in The Talented Mr Ripley and even, to a lesser extent, by Billy Kearns in Purple Noon. Eliot Sumner here was lifeless throughout and woefully miscast.What a shame.
0	"Don't bother watching ""Sugar"", unless you like utterly underwhelming shows. The pacing dragged, with scenes stretching out longer than necessary. As for Farrell's performance, he just didn't bring it this time, sadly. It felt like he was sleepwalking through the role. And with his character feeling so lifeless, I simply did not care for his plight. The premise seemed interesting, but found myself amazed that the team behind Sugar could make a series about a private detective so boring. Usually, I give a series at least two or three episodes, but I couldn't even make it past the pilot for this one. There's simply no pathway for improvement in this show short of a complete overhaul.Because of the slow pace and Farrell's anemic performance, I found myself zoning out more often than not, straining to muster up any interest in what was happening on screen. It's the kind of series that feels like a struggle to watch, rather than a pleasure. This show should have been called Valium rather than Sugar."
1	Season 8 ruined everything for me. What was once an entertaining show with solid writing and thrilling character arcs was reduced to nothing more than a Hallmark-type fantasy flick where logic or continuity had no room. Unfortunately, HBO took GOT's fans for granted and let two incompetent writers ruin the show completely. There's a petition calling for a remake of Season 8. It has garnered a significant number of signatures. I don't think this is gonna happen though. The damage has been done. It's permanent and cannot be undone. We waited two years for this season. We anticipated greatness. I mean it's only six episodes. How hard can it be? You had plenty of time to produce something epic. But mediocrity and stupidity is all we got. Shame!
2	Grays was our evening show and weekend binge, it's sincerely an epic show that'll hook you.... BUT let go after season 16 unfortunately. Apparently even with catching up up shows, you can tell covid and politics reak throughout the episodes and in hindsight smell even worse than when we lived through them the first time.
0	Constant unrelenting drama that never seems to go anywhere, barely any actual medicine.Had to quit watching after the Izzy incident, since the fact she never suffered any real consequences after gross malpractice was totally absurd, and in fact the show seemed to at least partially endorse her behavior because it was 'for the sake of love' and her coworkers were inexplicably pretty much fine with what she did after the fact despite freaking out about it just moments earlier.Nigh-on all the characters are detestable, especially Meredith who is endlessly indecisive and basically manipulates and ruins people's relationships for her own enjoyment.
1	"I can perfectly describe the entire series in comparison to the episodes up until the Red Wedding.The entire series there's been ups and downs, deaths of beloved characters, dissapoinments and excitement. Much like the death of Ned Stark which brought us sadness, and Robs rebellion which brought us hope.And everything was going well for a while. We made our theories. We started building upon our imagination. It was all going so well.And then the Red Wedding a.k.a. Season 8 came.The slaughter of the Northmen symbolizes the slaughter writers were doing to the storyline, writing as well as killing a bunch of characters during season 8.Catylns threats to kill Freys wife is us making a petition for a better ending. And Frey saying ""I'll find another"" symbolizes HBO saying we'll just make more prequels and sequels.Finally, Rob further represents the entire fan base and Roose Bolton stabbing him and taking his life represents Dan and Dave who literally took our hearts and love for this TV Show with this ending.*Dan and Dave Send Their Regards*"
2	Like everyone did I was stunned by how this show was so good in terms of the turn of events and unexpectable moments and deaths so many layered characters , acting was on point BUT ... also like everyone did I was SOCKED by S8 it was not the best ending season for this amazing show but not so terrible at least we got an ending I guess lol anyways I highly recommend this show to everyone
2	I watched the first 5 episodes, and I impressed with what I watched so farIt's rare to watch tv show with this incredible artwork, every scene is meticulously crafted , the lighting , the color grading, the music, the script. So authentic and poetic.They did an amazing job with the lighting and the shadows , it reflects on the faces making them more dramatic and the emotions more clearer on screen.The duality between the characters are well written, make you believe it , and become attached to them in their acts , despite the fact you agree or disagree with their reasonsLooking forward to watch the next remaining episodes, I wish it keep the same level of beauty .
0	"My wife's been binge watching this for a couple of weeks now. First couple of seasons where OK. First few seasons were OK and predictable - model quality newbie doctors having sex like bunnies with multiple partners while begging to ""scrub in."" Then a couple of the actors left and the writers must have revolted. Big drop off in script quality. In season 6-7 the doctors make weird decisions for no apparent reasons and they don't really suffer any consequences for their bad actions. Some episodes are by the book daytime soap opera plots with predictable acting.I can't really believe doctors behave this way. I'm almost happy for the characters that are killed off.Warning: In the first 4 seasons the actor that plays Dr McDreamy can only make 2 reaction faces. Dr Grey is incredibly made up. In some episodes it appears she ages 10 years.I'm not going to make it the last 8 seasons. My wife will."
0	When 37 years old woman acts and tries to be something like 27 i find it very very very disturbing. You can see the wrinkles from 'Meredith's' face and you can even understand by looking the series that she is really about same age as 'Bailey'.Same goes to 'Cristina' here. There's also 10 years too much but it doesn't show as bad as with 'Meredith'. 'Izzie' looks like a real woman, and what a surprise. She really is about same age as she acts to be. But in real life... 9 years younger than 'Meredith'. How really can directors and producers approve this kind of scam and think that all ppl looking at this are blind and really can't see the wrinkles around 'Meredith's' eyes.Over-aged actors here give me the creeps. 50% of the script has some point and if the series only had a better actor on the leading role, this could go between lunch and evening snack. With present... I can only hope that producers stop accepting >10 years too old ppl for roles. Thank you, next series.
0	Before Season 8, I gave rating of 10. I know it has some flaws but for me it was a 10. After the Season 8, specially after episode 5, I really can't get it! They ruined all the plotlines and the show! The writing is really bad and I am becoming mad (because it makes sense for my character arc...)!
1	This used to be a great TV show in seasons one and two. From there it's had it's ups and downs before but never as bad as this season. The 'Chenford' relationship is not good. I always thought they had more of a brother sister relationship and seeing those two making out is a bit creepy. The over done Bailey story lines are not good. First they portrayed her as super woman and then she suddenly didn't have enough sense to know the difference between a puppy and a coyote. The new Rookie and her silly psychic abilities are getting old and need to be toned way down. Hopefully they get some new writers soon and put this show back on track before it gets any goofier.
2	Oh, Grey's Anatomy, how your gods hate you. What horror, maiming, death, and psychological cruelty have they not visited upon you? Wait, and they'll soon think of more. From this much better world I watch your torture. Seeing you seize tiny moments of love and joy from your overworked lives only means that your sadistic gods have noticed you, and will soon turn and rend you again. You know, too, that if you try to depart, you will be dragged back to that hospital in some appalling state, and you will die. You doctors are doomed. Only the nurses are safe. So far.Sorry. So, so sorry.
0	Great show. Bad ending... They rushed everything in a few episodes wich Aren't all to bad but hardly resolve any story Lines and basicly are nothing more than a 'thank you for watching but let's wrap this up. Fast.'
0	There's good and there's not so good things, subjectively speaking ofc, and the not so good things make me question if I want to continue after the second episode.The good - the plot's arch sparks some interest by leaving some things hanging that engage the viewer. The structure of the narration seems to work fairly well. The world is build okay, it's not bad.The not so good - the characters lack personal depth. They feel like action movie characters. Fair enough, this seems like largely action based series, although somewhere labeled as drama. The world could be more grim. The humour often feels lazy, unimaginative and immature.This feels like an action game turned into a film, not a film based on a game. This feels shallow. Granted, I've only played the two first Fallout games, so maybe this series stays more loyal to the latter ones, but I really don't feel like this cartoonish action-based approach would convey the spirit of the two first. And beyond being a Fallout game on a film, this series seems to have little to offer to anyone else than the fans of the games.
0	I didn't see the original series in the 80's. I'm 40. I didn't read the book. Not my genre. However, I was looking forward to this and a new entertaining series for spring. Wrong. This show is an absolute snooze fest. My number one complaint is the subtitles. Most of the show is in Japanese with English subtitles. I want to watch a movie. Not read a movie. If I wanted to read a movie I'd get the book. Watched episode one figuring it would improve. As episode two ended I realized it was again full of subtitles and I had slept throw 1/3 of it. None of the characters are likeable. Its just overall boring.
2	GOT is consider to be one of the best TV series and that is for a reason, first excellent and extraordinary cast, second brilliant story and third for its direction. If we look at the opening seasons the story built by the show is up to the mark which sets the bar, way high and as the shows go on the character build by the writers and screenplay by the directors are good. For its story hands off to George RR Martin. But in the last season to end the show in limited episodes they screw the story and to create an unexpected ending they deviate the whole story. At last, I want to tell my best character in GOT- Tyrion Lannister(Peter Dinklage) bcoz of its cunningness, acting and dialogue delivery. Best scene- I demand a trial for combat tell me yours and why
1	"'3 body Problem' is an odd mix of great, mediocre, and sometimes frustrating. The general story, along with the arresting visuals, definitely keep you coming back for more. The ideas and concepts are catnip to any science fiction fan. The characters, on the other hand, are an entirely different ball game. Almost all of the leads are selfish, self-centred, self-righteous and often obnoxious.From what little I've read, it appears they're a major departure from the books, which I will admit I haven't read yet (Though I'm curious now). Of the 'scientists', the most interesting character is killed early on. The rest are a mix of self-absorbed narcissists, and far too controlled by their random emotions.Fate of the world at stake? Nah, I don't won't want to help, it's too much responsibility. All humans going to be eradicated? That's fine, because it's way off in the future, who cares about them? All of human civilisation and your descendants to be destroyed by heartless aliens? Well, my superior did something harsh but necessary to try and combat a seemingly unstoppable threat to all humanity, so I'm going to act morally superior and not help by spitting my dummy out.There also seems to be an obsession with Netflix (and Amazon) of having characters casually doing illicit substances all the time, as if it adds anything whatsoever to the characters or situation beyond making them feel even more weak-willed and pathetic.Of the non-scientist characters, Wade (Liam Cunningham) and Shi (Benedict Wong) are by far the most interesting. Both are struggling to get a handle on an impossible, unknown threat, and doing their best to fight it. Sometimes that means making the most horrific decisions for the greater good. That moral grey area could have made for some interesting conversations with the other leads who felt squeamish, but instead it just ends up with them being high-and-mighty and acting morally superior. Never once did anyone sit down and say ""Okay, what would you suggest? Is this terrible? Yes. Did we have a choice, fighting this enemy, given what is at stake and the odds against us?""Ultimately, it also feels a little aimless and lacklustre. The big event that this series was leading up to failed. In addition, far too much time was spent on a rather boring character leading into it. (I have little doubt that character will 'return' in season two, but at this point it makes it all feel pointless).For an introductory series, it fails to give a sense of satisfying conclusion. You can have a story where the heroes 'fail' in order to make their success all the more satisfying down the line, but when they fail so spectacularly at the first hurdle it just feels a bit pointless. Having said all that, the interesting ideas and concepts make it worth watching, and at least it wasn't superheroes..."
0	What's all the hype about, you ask? Why are all the nerds giggling like a 5 year old? Well that's because th 3 body series is one of the greatest pieces of science fiction literature in recent history. The books are deeply imaginative, philosophical and ponder some very interesting questions relating to the universe and extra terrestrial life.Now, If you haven't read the book(s) then it's a totally different thing and the show isn't half as bad and it's something you'll watch once and enjoy and that's about it.Understandably, they've changed the setting and added some bits to make it work as a TV adaptation but it has more than a few pitfalls:1. The motley crew of main characters feel generic and there's too much drama thrown in with little time spent on developing them.2. The above said actors have done a very sub par job and you don't feel any connection to them.3. There is this sense of existential dread and fear of the unknown you get when you read the book. By adding needless (and poorly done) humour it breaks whatever little tension that has built up.But to be fair they've done a great job with how they've shown the backstory of Ye Wenjie, all that's been done beautifully.It's not an easy book to adapt to TV by any measure but trying to cater to a wide general population has turned this into a tasteless mish mash that doesn't satisfy anyone.
2	Translating a complex Sci-Fi book with abstract concepts and make it engaging is a mind boggling task at the least. I'm glad to say the series has done its level best to visualise it. It's captivating, dumbs down the scientific concepts involved AND keeps it interesting. Though not all elements are brought onto the screen, it's understandable, compared to the genre difference between GOT and 3BP. At the end of episode 8, I was craving for more. The stark balance between science and the human emotions is thought proving. Season 1 ending made me crave for more of the story to be brought to the screen.To the reviews which state the series is not true to the source material, honestly, it's an unrealistic expectation considering the concepts and the grand scale of the series. It's a catch-22. Making the series too complicated alienates the casual viewership thus reducing the chances of an another season. Making a lean version of the series potentially leads to low ratings from the book readers. Considering the source material's complexity to get it on screen, I for one, would vouch for more seasons with the core concepts of the books being unchanged while taking the creative liberties needed to ensure the series gets it's due closure!
0	The first two seasons are very good, and then it just goes downhill from there. Season 3 is not as bad as season 4 and absolutely not ad bad ad season 5. Season 3 has some pretty dumb episodes though, and maybe they should be seen as a warning for whats to come. Especially episode 7 in season 3 is a lowpoint in that season. Season 4 gets annoying cause it's filled with men vs. Women or system vs. Women agendas. So it gets pretty woke. In the middle of season everything becomes much dumber, and the lovestory between Lucy and Tim is like soapopera. It's cheap. Throughout the series, I've been wondering how bad the cops and robbers are at shooting. There is a lot of shootouts, but they almost never hit eachother. In season 5 episode 8 Lucy and a suspect gets into a shootout, and there is litteraly only 1 meter and no cover between them. They fire a lot of rounds at eachother, but no one gets hit. How is that possible? I can't wait to see the next dumb thing happening.
2	Black & white The Talented Mr. Ripley.What the series did better: Andrew Scott played a better and darker Thomas Ripley than Matt Damon, the black & white and stylistic cinematography were A++, Dakota Fanning was a much better/smarter Marge than Gwyneth, having Ripley cover up all his murders only made it feel more real, and the Dickie boat murder was way better in this. Also, Andrew Scott in a speedo...I 🍀 Irish boysWhat the film did better: Johnny Flynn is and will never be no Jude Law!, how was Dickie that old and still acting like he was in his 20s?, personally felt that the show went on 2 episodes longer than it should've.
0	"As a fan of Liu Cixin's renowned science fiction novel ""The Three-Body Problem,"" I was eager to delve into the recently adapted series that promised to bring this complex tale to life. However, what I encountered was a disappointing departure from the core essence of the characters and themes.One of the most striking misinterpretations was the portrayal of the main character's disillusionment with humanity. In the novel, her despair stems from profound philosophical and existential questions about the nature of civilization and morality. Yet, in the series, this was overshadowed by a focus on her romantic relationships, reducing her struggles to superficial romantic entanglements.The title ""The Three-Body Problem"" alludes to a complex astrophysical phenomenon, symbolizing the intricate challenges faced by civilizations. However, the adaptation reduced this to a literal interpretation of ""three human bodies"".Another letdown was the subpar special effects, especially considering the reported budget of 20 million. The visual portrayal of advanced civilizations and scientific concepts fell short, failing to immerse viewers in the awe-inspiring world envisioned by Liu Cixin.Furthermore, the series seemed to reflect a limited understanding of cultural and historical contexts. The emphasis on Western perspectives and a reductionist view of human emotions undermined the depth and universality of the story, highlighting a lack of cultural nuance."
0	The first few seasons where amazing as they were based on the books, as the show started to advance and as the fewer material and content got the worse the show became, starting season 6 you can notice a clear decline in the quality of episodes, you can clearly notice the increase of time fillers up until season 8 which was the most horrible of them all. Don't invest too much time on the series of you haven't started but just skip through the episode as some of the scenes are worth watching.
2	This show was amazing, one of the best I've ever seen, til Derek died..seasons after that are becoming worse and worse. The show has lost it's charm, patients and dilemma's about them aren't in focus anymore..sad to see what they've done to my favourite show..I used to be impatient about every new episode, I couldn't wait Thursday and new episode and now season 16 is out and I still haven't watched season 15
0	"Another typical TV series adapted haphazardly based on one's own imagination and feelings, turning a masterpiece in the sci-fi world into a mediocre production. Wasn't ruining ""Game of Thrones"" enough? After watching all 8 episodes, these two writers give me the impression that they haven't even read the classic ""The Three-Body Problem"" but merely glanced through someone's brief summary on TikTok, then combined it with their limited intelligence to create this TV series. If Liu Cixin, the author of The Three-Body Problem, had used the script written by these two superficial screenwriters, he would definitely not have been able to win the Hugo Award, and his status in the science fiction community would have plummeted to the bottom."
0	I was waiting for the coming doom that was the Night's King. I have been anticipating how his hoard of the dead would overtake the land of men, the seven kingdoms, everything. I was given this disappointment. I can't even say I'm mad, I'm just disappointed. Go to your room.
1	"Violence over substance: The creators seem to believe that more bloodshed equates to better drama.Heads explode, bodies fly, and video game logic reigns triumphant!But violence alone cannot sustain a series. The relentless gore becomes numbing, overshadowing any semblance of character development or plot progression.Acting Fallout: The cast struggles to rise above the mediocrity of the script. Ella Purnell, as Lucy, delivers a strong performance, but her character's journey feels lost in the chaos.Walton Goggins, playing The Ghoul, is the standout, but even his smooth-talking chaos can't salvage the sinking ship... The rest of the ensemble flounders, their potential squandered.Inconsistent Tone: ""Fallout"" wavers between dark humor and grim violence. While some appreciate the juxtaposition of punchlines amidst the apocalypse, others find it jarring. The show's tone resembles a bipolar wasteland, leaving viewers disoriented and disconnected.Plot Potholes: The narrative stumbles like a ghoul with a broken leg. Instead of weaving a compelling story within the established Fallout universe, the show opts for a new tale.Unfortunately, it lacks depth and coherence. The puzzle-box mystery occasionally intrigues but often over-complicates matters.Missed Opportunities: With nearly three decades of game lore, ""Fallout"" had a treasure trove to explore.Yet, it squanders this potential. The satire, wackiness, and rich world-building from the games are diluted, leaving fans yearning for more."
0	After 5 episodes of season 8 - I simply refuse to believe such bad writing is allowed by HBO management. They should take personal responsibility and quit, all of them!No more HBO for me.Unless they all quit!
0	Watched the show from season 1-10 and thought it was good but then i slowly stopped watching as life got in the way. Came back in the middle of season 16 and its like everything changed. A giant chunk of the main characters with any personality are gone or have died and yet Ellen pompeo is still there after 18 seasons. All the current characters are so blah and just seem to want to screw each other over and love to argue about the most petty things.In summary-Characters past season 10 have turned into a bunch of whiny petty idiots that cant seem to practice medicine better than a toddler with a kitchen knife that snorted cocaine.
2	The series is a fantastic adaption. The actor playing Ripley nails the role and you really start to appreciate his acting as the show goes on. The show was artistic, psychological and immensely entertaining. I enjoyed the 1990d version but this might top it for me. I was impressed by the way things came out at the end that made me rethinking earlier conversations in the show. The back and white picture is was also perfect. The way they did the subtitles was impressive. Overall, you have to give the producers credit for how they were able to create something fresh and new from a story that's been told well before.
0	"Sorry, the following is an AI translation Lack of scientific literacy and illogical reasoning. The artificial intelligence of the human computer has become a sign, which even makes the computer logic wrong. Apart from black and white, there are also double black and double white and no sign, without such basic scientific literacy.And the flicker of the universe, visible to the naked eye? Can you tell me how Zhizi can do it? The Tencent version still needs to be observed through 3k glasses, which turns you into the naked eye. It lacks scientific literacy and goes against the horror of the original work that ""the entire universe only flickers for you."".And the Red Bank base is transmitting signals, but Ye Wenjie and his team are actually standing directly under the radar? The director obviously doesn't know how much microwave radiation this radar has, because with his scientific literacy, he can only understand what is visible. Is it difficult to use one's brain to think about whether a person standing below would suffer serious harm, even if the death of a flying bird is clearly displayed? A science fiction work with so many low-level errors is like elementary school students telling stories, terrible!The changes to the characters also completely lose their complexity. Although Ye Wenjie suffered persecution during the Cultural Revolution, she lost hope for human self rescue. But she is a savior rather than a descendant, believing that Trisolarans have a higher moral level to transform humanity. In the hands of Netflix, there is only bitter hatred left, and the flat character design has made her lose her charm. Many characters have lost their charm, and the director cannot understand the complexity of their thoughts. He can only use plain behavior to show his first impression of the characters, and interpret this excellent work in the form of low-quality fast food. This is the tragedy of the Three Body Problem book Poor quality special effects, the special effects of the flying blade cutting ship are like CG from ten years ago, and the reason for choosing flying blade cutting in the original work is: 1. There are very few innocent people on the ship, only one canal navigator, minimizing innocent casualties. 2. The movement is small, and the speed is fast. Can avoid discovering and destroying hard drive data in Evans. There has been a complete change here, with so many children on board. Is this ETO headquarters or a primary school outing yacht? Killing so many innocent people is an insult to this plan. And Evans has such a long reaction time, even holding data in his arms. Why didn't he destroy it? It is illogical to turn such a clever plan from the original work into a vulgar American disaster film."
0	This first episode was really catching. Afterwards it just went downhill from there. If you are sane person who still have moral values left in todays modern society don't waste your time watching this show. Its Pathetic and Disgusting. Luckily it was only 7 episodes. My body and soul feels sick after watching this show. Should of stopped after episode 4. Only continued it because it was getting good ratings. Assuming it would end in good terms. Not even time will heal to take this show out my body. I don't know if I should feel sorry for the character or for myself for finishing this disgusting show.
0	"This series officially jumped the shark one season later than Heroes and I'm not at all surprised. I can almost hear the show runners, before the first episode was filmed, sitting at a long conference table saying ""We have to start strong...make the first couple seasons entertaining. Then, we get people invested in our characters, then...BOOM! We set the hook and start spoon-feeding them the agenda!"" Well, I'm spitting out the spoon AND the hook!"
1	The main character Sugar is just too good. He's a private detective not above working for the Japanese mafia, but the only jobs he takes are finding lost persons. He's so good at what he does that he doesn't need to take any other kind of private detective work. And he has perfect integrity. He sees a homeless person on the street and goes out of his way to rehabilitate him and reunite him with his family. He won't have sex with a woman if she's drunk. He doesn't like carrying a gun. We're supposed to believe he's a saint. Sorry, not convincing but rather off-putting. I've only seen the first episode, but that's what it is so far.
0	What a BAD , poorlly writen end season for a really good show .. No reason to sit 7 seasons for this .
2	"I've think the show is amazing, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. But when it first started with only two episodes out, I couldn't help but feel the need to tell some people to pipe down a bit. Calling it next Game of Thrones already. Since GOT ended, there's been a flood of shows and movies being dubbed as the new Game of Thrones. Sometimes it's Game of Thrones with pirates like ""Black Sails"", or Game of Thrones in space, as seen in ""Dune"" and Apple TV's ""Foundation."" Other times, shows like ""Wheel of Time"" and ""The Witcher"" received comparisons that eventually died down. Don't get me wrong, I actually like all of those, but I'm just a bit tired of the ""this is the new GOT!!"" hype.But this show is actually quite good and refreshingly different, especially since it's set in Japan. Starting to admire Anna Sawai, having seen her in Monarch Legacy and now in Shogun. Apparently, she was also in F9. The show delves into a lot of Japanese lore, like beliefs and samurai culture, although I can't vouch for its accuracy. I've learned a lot about Japanese culture, particularly their dedication to rituals and customs. Hiroyuki Sanada seems to have a penchant for playing samurai or sword fighters: 47 Ronin (2013), John wick, bullet train, mortal combat, avengers endgame.Despite my reservations about calling it the next Game of Thrones, the show does have a strong political undertone, with different factions vying for power and the looming threat of civil war. Something small that I like was the show's title sequence.While the show is generally well-executed, it feels a bit odd to have the Japanese characters speaking Japanese and the Portuguese speaking Portuguese, yet having Portuguese dialogue in English lol. Japanese is subtitles. There are some things I might have missed explanations for, like the peculiar condition of Regent Ohno's skin.Many people compare it to Game of Thrones, but I find it more akin to Vikings, albeit less violent than expected. It leans more towards being a political drama at the moment, although there are hints of impending war. My only gripe is that it seems to shy away from on-screen violence, with many fights and deaths occurring off-screen. It's gory at times, but it teases so many epic battles and wars, and with one episode left, we still only get glimpses of them. Even if the last episode is just one epic battle sequence, I'll still feel the same.Now, I absolutely adore this show. It's a rare case, akin to ""Godzilla: Minus One,"" where the show/movie perfectly hits its target audience. ""Godzilla: Minus One"" was almost exclusively watched by fans of Godzilla and similar genres (myself included); everyone watching knows what to expect. I believe Shogun is predominantly being watched by its intended audience. Even though a show or movie can be amazing, it's very rare for it to receive purely positive reviews. And I think that's what's happening with Shogun - it's an amazing show mainly being watched by its target audience."
1	"SPOILERSBut he is not likeable at all really, terrible comedian, uses people in order to make himself feel better constantly, does a lot of stupid things and messes his life up and then wants sympathy for doing so.Halfway through the show he says ""how can I report her and not him"" (Both did bad things to the MC). And then proceeds to not only report her, but go and APOLOGISE to him at the end of the show despite him being significantly WORSE than the stalker!!And then keep listening to her voicemails for validation that he is an alright bloke, after sending her to jail for sending them, but the REAL main villain gets no consequences, he actually gets REWARDED.MC keeps insisting he needs to stay where he is and not do anything to change the situation, insisting that he can't because he can't afford to, despite his family offering him to come home for free and being very supportive in the scenes they are featured in.Show is weirdly transphobic in places, (MC needs to imagine that his partner is literally his horrible stalker in order to finish amongst other things), but also wants to dedicate swathes of time to us feeling sorry that his partner got misgendered by a mentally ill woman, not that she was assaulted and physically harmed?The same partner who was attacked and refuses to go to the police and report it but keeps yelling at the main character to report it, but he won't because he is enjoying the attention from the stalker. Why wouldn't you just go and report your own assault at that point?I mean the main saving grace of the show is that the main character acknowledges how he has contributed to his own downfall and that he has been loving the attention, but its then instantly taken away by him going to apologise and accept to work with the guy again.I gave it a 5 because the show is actually quite gripping and I do feel sorry for the circumstances that occurred, the MC, who this is based on a true story by, gives a fantastic performance, I am sure spurred on by experiencing this in his real life, you can feel his pain at times. The lady who plays the stalker is also fantastic, she is probably the best character in the show, despite only being present for just over half of it."
0	"Glad I waited to give a review because this season ruins anything and everything I've always loved about this show. It's a joke. Meredith down and out for SEVERAL episodes because of COVID and the shows script writers forcing the characters to relentlessly shout about ""systemic racism"". It's cringe worthy. This COVID/RACISM let's beat a dead horse season is the worst thing I've ever seen happen in this show. Like, WE GET IT. Shut up already. Truly sad. I would prefer to rewatch Derek pass 4 more times than subject myself to this brand of torture. Also, I couldn't stand Maggie from day 1 and she has NEVER had a redemptive character arc. She's a spoiled, self entitled, utterly PRESUMPTUOUS, gets-the-award-for-the-single-most-ANNOYING effing character ever to smear television with BRAT. Wish they kept DeLuca and got rid of her. Maybe if they write her character off I'll try season 18."
0	I watched the first 4 series in one breath. Captured strong emotions, character's personalities, expressive acting . Looking through keyhole into strangers' dramas makes your blood boil. I've forced myself to watch the last 3 series to decide whether to add Richard Gard to my list of director-favourites, new talents. No, I will not.The last series, the streams of crocodile tears, Donny Dunn's boring face, stiff as a crumpled pillow , the hastily wrapped up plot reminded me of a Brazilian primitive soap opera or Tik Tok clips.Very very pity for the time wasted. The cinematographic value is z-e-r-o, a jumble of stereotypes. Much has already been seen. Stand-up comedian's tragic dramas, expressive del arte style, part of the scenes in Leos Carax's feerie Annette. Back in 2007, cinematic genius Hector Babenco brilliantly revealed how a stalker in love ruthlessly destroys a man's life. Watch his artistic masterpiece El Pasado with Garcia Bernal.Baby Reindeer will grow in popularity among the social network lusers. Those who have no active, interesting real life. They will recognise their complexes, traumas, loneliness, fears, infantilism, addictions in the neuroses and obsessions of mentally deranged characters. In this sense, film is psychotherapeutic. It can be excellent tool for psychotherapists. If they have, of course, the patience to follow Donny's backstage, extended, paranoid, boring monologue.
1	I recently caught the Fallout TV series and it's definitely an interesting watch. There were moments that felt a tad cringey, especially with some of the acting, but I have to admit, the gore was on point. It's a bit of a mixed bag - some scenes really nail it, while others fall a bit short. Still, I'd say it's worth giving it a shot. Personally, I found myself enjoying it despite the occasional awkward performance. You can tell they really invested heavily in production - the sets, props, and effects are top-notch. Surprisingly, it exceeded my expectations. That said, there's room for improvement, particularly in the acting department. It feels like they may have prioritized visuals over casting, but hey, it worked out pretty well in the end. Overall, a solid effort, but there's definitely potential for even greater things with some tweaks here and there.
2	This was both easy & hard to watch.Easy because the pacing, narrating, acting were spot on. None of the dull pointless fillers. And the way the story unfolded and revealed things will keep you hooked.Hard watch because well, it is dark, very dark. Plus it's based on a true story with the main actor as the same guy in real life. The human complexity & psychology, the vulnerable subjects were all handled quite well.Sometimes you can't believe this happened to a person, but then you remember life is stranger than fiction. The ending really moved me.I highly recommend you give this a try. I didn't expect it to be that good.
0	An potentially interesting story stretched out into an elongated confusing mess. Typical of Netflix. I'm not entirely sure who I'm supposed to empathise with in this story. I ended up disliking everyone..especially Donny. I gave up caring about the outcome, and after episode 3 just found myself watching episodes..4..5..6! Whilst scrolling on my phone. Did it go to episode six? God knows..it all just melted into this self pitying gumbo. The woman who played His stalker Martha is the highlight, she is a fantastic actor, and She carried this whole thing..if she wasn't so believable then this would have fallen apart.
0	"First 2 seasons were very good. Funny, loved mix of tv videography with ""body cam"" footage. This season its a bunch of preachy garbage of what they feel is right and wrong."
0	This leaves me with the feeling of having my head filled with poop. And I don't know how to detox myself. It's that revolting.The only thing that kept me going was the 100% rotten tomato score that kept popping up on all my social media feeds, and the reason why I decided to watch it. On hindsight it was probably paid for.Curiosity killed the cat and here i am. Having watched the whole series in search for some semblance of normalcy, waiting for a decent closure. I don't want to know how screwed up you are! While you profile Martha and her troubled childhood, that too a little sniper in the end. Where's you? Why'd you keep succumbing to all kinds of abuse? That's the elephant in the room and no one addresses it.Now I can only depend on time to heal me .Disgusting disgusting series.
1	My grade was 6 because I judged the series with a technical eye, and I came to the conclusion that technically the series' script is standardized and predictable, at several moments I was able to deduce what was going to happen. Other than that, the series has a good pace at times, at others not so much like the last episode of the first season where at times the scenes were very slow. The positive points are the scenarios, battles, references to the game, the humor and the atmosphere. The script between the future and the past was ok. The final revelation that the protagonist's father is behind everything was really cool. The script greatly favors the protagonists, so it is clear that it is a predictable and ok script. The creatures are a good positive point, but we didn't have many on the scene. The ending leaves a hint for a possible season. Well, there are several points to consider but I will just leave these comments from my perspective.
1	The episode is very bad We did not know who the promised prince was The death scene of the night king is very stupid
2	"It's really wild to think that this would be the project that Jonathan Nolan would hang his hat on and say ""Hey now this! This is something!"" And throughout watching the season I couldn't quite tell if this was the product of someone who lived the games or Todd Howard himself, and it turns out it was Todd Howard himself. But to reduce this show down to a comparison to The Last of Us wouldn't do the show justice by any means. This takes the spirit of the games, along with its humor, and runs with it. Lisa Joy, Jonathan Nolan, and Co. Weave a such a well crafted season of television that it makes me ashamed to say I even doubted the duo that crafted the first season of Westworld. There's a world that I want to stretch a lawn chair out in and sit back with my Nuka Cola.Ella Purnells Lucy is a warm center to anchor this story in. Surrounded with excellent characters like Moises Arias' Norm and, of course, the selling point of the show. Walton Goggins' Ghoul of a character makes me want scream Yee Haw and run through the desert buck naked.I can't wait to see what happens with the rest of this shows life. Whether it suffer the fate of so many other Amazon Prime shows, or god forbid, befall the fate of a show like The Boys. I just hope we can revel in this fun world that the Nolan's have made for a good time. And hopefully a long time.Blu."
2	If you're a vault dweller like me, you will have played Fallout since it first came out as an RPG back in the 90s. A sprawling and somewhat overwhelming game with a rich world and fantastic characters.It is the gem in Bethesda's catalogue.With other games receiving the Hollywood treatment, it was only time before someone took this on. Enter Johnathon Nolan.If you aren't a fan, I would suggest you search for a short introduction to the world of Fallout, but, it can be hard to follow with such a soup of themes and stories.This is well worth a watch nonetheless. It has Nolan-esque tropes and plays with time and theme.It can be a little hard to follow, and the action is taut and straight out of the playbook. Fallout has enough references and thematic callbacks, that it is hard not to like.The characters are written well, the dialogue is good, the story is true to the lore of Fallout, and the set is particularly rewarding.Walter Goggins is a fantastic actor and he carries a lot of the charm on his shoulders. As for the rest of the cast, they each perform their pieces with plum.The music, CGI and sound design are all of a fine standard, and despite Amazon's many fails, this could very well be a hit. Just as long as they don't drag it out and go meme hunting like Rings of Power.If there is any criticism, it would be that there could have been more of a callback to VATS and the gaming element. This does not detract however, as it is important to know that this is a serial and not a game.Give it a go and make your own mind up. However, it is hard to not like this show for the characters collective journeys.
1	Once again I wrote a review without watching the whole season and once again IMDb deleted that review, just like they did for 3 Body Problem.Well I have now watched the full season of Fallout because for some reason I couldn't turn it off, I kept thinking this is terrible and I should watch something else, but I just couldn't.I certainly didn't enjoy the comedy, but I did enjoy the performance of some of the actors, like Walton Goggins and Aaron Moten, but my special praise is for Ella Purnell who I thought was brilliant, so the 7 I've given it is just for Ella, I think without her I wouldn't have watched the whole series.I don't know much about the games as I've only played one of the once, and I got bored, so is this meant to have comedy?
0	I quitted it after 6 episodes because 80% of the scenes are about a couple of friends, one with terminal cancer, the other a scientist, that love each other but they dont say it, like, COME ON!!! There are like 1000 movies and series with the same romantic plot, why u put the most basic cliché love story in SCI FI SERIES!!!! And it has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the aliens and physics of the book, why is Netflix always ruining good original material for no reason? Just to win hate and unsubscriptions? They ruined Poe novels changing everything he created, then Avatar, and now this? Why u wanna earn the hate of the public? It should be illegal to sell a series as sci fi but it's a Love Actually spin off, like this series, at least they should have put All I want for Chritsmas from Mariah Carey like in the original Love Actually movie, but they made it as bad as they could, -10/10!! Still waiting for a three body problem adaptation, this one doesn't count.
1	1. Legend of the Promised Prince / First Warrior / Azor Ahai has been canceled.2. The whole chapter about Stannis and Melissandre is meaningless3. The various actions of Jon as Lord Commander of the Night Watch (Rescue of the Wildlings) and the desperate attempt to explain to others that the true war is in the north. Everything meaningless.4. The background story of the Night King was screwed up. He is abused by the children of the forest as a weapon and became independent. Why? Can he still think and feel? If so, what exactly is his motive? How could he actually survive the first long night? Will he revived all 8,000 years? So many unsolved questions.5. For what all the effort? Why did Jon risk his life when it only needs a Dagger to win?
0	The first episode was intriguing but after that I just found the lead character to be a complete idiot. He would put himself into bad situations constantly and make dreadful decisions without considering the consequences. It wasn't funny either and the entertainment soon dried up as stupidity and unrealistic nature of the story continued. Don't waste your time, I just don't get the level of positivity.Apparently, this is based on a true story but I do not believe it for a second. Surely, nobody is stupid enough to get themselves into the situations presented in this series. I found myself not being sympathetic to the lead character but disliking him and no longer being interested in whatever happened to him. A loser!
1	This show came with a lot of hype, and nowadays everybody on social media is basically shilling for somebody. A show doesn't even have to be good to earn a second season, it just has to bring in enough viewers to merit a second, and the number of viewers doesn't hinge on the quality of the show, just how well it was marketed. I watched it because Sanada has a lead role and I fell for the hype.So the show has good marketing, good enough to raise expectations, but alas Shogun fails to match its hype. This is has the distinct feel of a tv show, and some of the dialogue is a bit simplistic. What really threw me was laziness that infests the show. We have Japanese actors speaking Japanese, but everyone is speaking Portuguese in English. Incredibly silly choice that completely degrades the seriousness of the show. It's a fact that the Portuguese tried to colonise Japan, so why hide from the epic scale that multiple languages would have given the show?Some of the casting gave this a Xena warrior princess feel. Perhaps it should have had a bigger budget or been made as a movie? Theres not much going on in terms of plot, and the weekly release schedule just doesn't work in today's day and age. There's just no way to remember what happened over the previous episodes if one takes a month's break.The British protestant captain is poorly cast and the acting bordering on pantomime.Japan is a stunningly beautiful county, and I think they really missed a trick with the cinematography. Nearly all the shots fail to immerse, looking like they have shot this distinctly TVesque show in a studio somewhere, rather than on location.As an aside, I'm very skeptical of reviews that rate 10 on the basis of a few episodes.
0	It's surly not the worst series about doctors I have ever seen, but all the life altering events and tragedies the main characters go through, get boring/repetitive after the first three seasons. I watched this during quarantine and otherwise would've probably never picked it up, still if you're bored and wanna watch something so awful its good again, Greys Anatomy is a great choice for you!
2	I love it from all of my heart thanks for this great thing
0	It's almost too difficult to watch any of the early seasons now that I know how badly the final season was written.some of the best acting and CGI,etc I've ever seen , completely let down by writers who once they no longer had source material were incompetent.incredibly disappointed that they rushed what could have been a good ending into a few episodes and skipped all of the dialogue.
2	"Started this show with no expectations. I quite honestly just ""threw"" it on trying to fall asleep.Then was surprised at how good it was 20 minutes in. Decided to look at IMDB, now awake. I researched the director of this series and his past work (whether that as a producer, writer, or director- Schindler's List being a great black/ white example). Then it made sense.Had this been done by someone else, I could easily see it coming off as ""slow"". He knows what he is doing.The way this show is done (for some reason) is anything but slow. Never wanted it to stop. Great watch. Thought the lead man did an awesome job, had never seen him."
0	The characters and dialogue in the 1st two seasons were not sensational, but it was the only US cop show i can recall watching and enjoying in a long time.Unfortunately, season 3 went completely off the rails with the victimhood politics and misandry. New characters are caricatures, literally all of them. Calling them cardboard cutouts would be an insult to cardboard. And dialogue seems to be written by ChatGPT trained solely on buzfeed articles.It's criminal to let such great cast and characters that were developed over the course of 2 seasons go to waste. Maybe it gets better later on? Who knows? I certainly don't care.
1	I really liked the moved wen they changed to comedy for the last season. Perfect 5/7
1	"After binge-watching the 8 episodes of Netflix's ""The Three-Body Problem,"" as someone who has read the entire trilogy and watched Tencent's series closely following the first book, I consider the Netflix adaptation to be an ""good"" level US/UK drama. For those new to the ""Three-Body"" universe, I'd rate it between 7.5 to 8. However, compared to Tencent's detailed 30-episode adaptation, Netflix's attempt to cover the first book in just 6 episodes resulted in the loss of many essences from the book. Personally, the most disappointing aspect was the portrayal of Ye Wenjie. As a core character of the trilogy, she was depicted with much more depth and conviction in both the book and Tencent's version. Netflix's portrayal, however, was quite brief and made her level ""much lower"", leaving me and many other fans a bit disappointed. Nonetheless, it's still a good watch, especially for newcomers. But if you're captivated by this amazing story, I'd definitely recommend checking out Tencent's version or reading the books."
0	"Almost all of the science in the book is missing from this ""science"" fiction adaptation. For example, the countdown that is introduced in the first few minutes of the show is treated as a serious and explainable phenomenon in the book and Chinese adaptation of the book. The main character does a lot of different experiments to determine how real the countdown is and what kind of limitations it has. For those that have read the book, you'll be sorry to hear that all of the camera experiments have been removed from the show. The main character just randomly sees a countdown at a karaoke bar (no, I'm not kidding!)I don't understand how any of the 10 star reviews can honestly say this is even a remotely accurate representation of the source material. This is yet another show that underestimates the intelligence of the viewers to such a degree that the essence of what makes the novel interesting is totally lost."
0	It's got to be one of the most atrocious TV series, Top 10 at least. I couldn't get past the 3rd episode. Although I'm pretty much aware this is solely based on the games (which I've never liked), the games turn out to be good compared to this demented TV series.How on earth this got 8.7 score??? It's really unbelievable. The only reason must be people from 8 years to 12 years old watching it on a massive scale.The script is horrible, the clichés are horrible, the actors are horrible. There's absolutely nothing to like here if you are 18 years old or older. I'd really like to know how they managed to produce such a giant piece of garbage. Fallout indeed.
0	I have never played the games, but I heard a lot of raving about how great this series was so figured it was worth a shot.There were some okay scenes, but throughout the opening episode we are bashed over the head with far too much awful music that distracts from what could have been more entertaining.It never really gripped my attention, despite a few nice ideas. But the main issue I had was the lack of clarity behind what was going on. Of course, there was nuclear fallout, but why were some living in bunkers and others in the outside world? Why was one from the bunker so confident to venture outside when it had already been stated that it wouldn't be safe for at least another generation. I reached the point where I just didn't care enough about any of the characters to carry on watching any further episodes.Maybe fans of the games can see more than I did, but I can't be bothered carrying on with this series.
1	"The story is decent but whoever wrote the characters and most of the dialogue needs to goJin and Auggie are simply unsufferable. Auggie seems unable to go 10 lines without swearing. They always seem on the verge of throwing a tantrum. Like it's literally making it difficult to watch because I feel attacked through the screen. I know this is the idea that some writers have about ""strong women"" but I don't think it's working. Also why do they react to everything by getting mad lmao aren't they scientists?Enough has been said about Will's only character traits being that he has cancer and he can't propose to Jin. He's unsufferableWade and the detective are so stereotyped that it becomes laughable at times. Sometimes Wade says ""cool stuff"" that doesn't even make senseI'm sorry because the story is good but so much revolved around these unsufferable characters, and I suppose it will going forward since we aren't going to see the Aliens for a couple hundred years."
2	I know it's far too early to say this, but based off the first two episodes alone this seems like an absolute hit.The dialogue is captivating, the acting phenomenal so far (Hiroyuki Sanada is an instant crowd fave), and the characters are quite interesting. I appreciate that the characters have been presented as morally gray, and that they don't insult the viewers intelligence by spelling out obvious character details like Blackthornes need to adapt to this new culture to survive in this world, or the many intricate political plots driving the show forward. Any point of confusion is cleared out tastefully within the dialogue and it's easy to follow.I have not yet read the book, nor am I an expert on this period of Japanese history, but from what I do know, it seems fairly historically accurate in its portrayal of costumes, Japanese philosophy, and the intricacies in political rivalries. In the case that you are not aware of the historical context, the show even released a mini documentary episode a week prior to the first episodes which contained all the relevant background you might need to understand the show. This is something I very much appreciate because I like to dig deeper into the history or lore of every show or movie that I like, it makes the entire experience much more immersive.I don't understand the criticism it's been getting on the basis of being mostly in Japanese... considering it is set in Japan pre globalization I thought that would be a given. It would actually be unrealistic for characters to BE speaking in english, but I digress. I get that reading subtitles is not everyone's cup of tea but i'd much rather do that than have badly dubbed or unrealistic dialogue which would break the immersion for me.I'm a little apprehensive about the pacing for the rest of the show, although it was perfectly fine for the first two episodes. This is simply because i'm not entirely sure how they'll manage to fit all the details in just another 8 episodes. I really hope they finish on a satisfying note, or with enough of an open ending to actually justify a second season.This definitely wasn't on my radar for the year, I hadn't even heard of the show until it dropped yesterday but since then i've already purchased the book so i can read it when i'm done watching this. It really is just that incredible.If you're a fan of historical drama, or liked shows such as Black Sails and Blue eyed Samurai, this is for you. I highly recommend this show, and i'll be seated for the rest of it to see how it plays out. If the quality remains consistent to the first two episodes, it has the potential to be the best show of the year.
0	Old Fallout fans finally get a return to the West Coast, and I wish we hadn't asked for it.If you are a fan of the original Fallout games, you'll remember the town of Shady Sands. That got nuked. Which perfectly sums up how Bethesda feels about anything that came before 3.The writers call themselves fans, but there are multiple examples of them ignoring established lore. Ghoulifcation does not work the way it is represented in the show. They changed how power armors propulsion works, which having them jet up from the arms exclusively makes literally 0 sense, even ignoring the fact that in itself ignores previously established lore.The story revolves around a Vault dweller going after a family member that left the vault. I find it ironic that the main story beat is one of the things they decided to actually keep consistent with the games seeing as everyone is exhausted with that.Also, the macguffin for this one is a magical device that will bring power and clean water to the wasteland. Sound familiar?They set up going to New Vegas in season 2 which is just horrible. Going there canonizes one of the endings depending on which factions are present, but we all know Todd hates New Vegas so i can't say I'm surprised.I will say it's deserving of the 1 star because at least the costume design was great. However I can honestly say, you'd have gotten a better representation of Fallout by playing 76 at launch.
1	"We all prepared for the worst and it didn't come.Fallout TV show was kinda good.They've nailed the aestethic, went a bit overboard with the music and had interesting characters. They respected the games pretty much to a letter.Walton Goggins is great, as always, but I think Ella Purnell was the best one here. While the characters were interesting, I wished they were a bit ""more"" of everything.B plot inside the Vault 33 is also solid but they did took their sweet damn time revealing it. Main plot is interesting and in tune with the games.Biggest flaw is, however, that they just could not decide if this was a comedy or a serious drama, then blending it both in a way that made it neither. Is it funny? Yeah, but kinda not really. Is it very serious? Yeah, it tries to be but it's just not working sometimes.It should have been a straight up comedy with serious elements here and there. But, nothing that can't be fixed in Season 2.However, I'm pretty sure Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy duo as producers are mostly responsible for tone consistency problems. Like their previous potential TV hits - Westworld and Peripheral, this can be driven into the ground like those shows as well. Most notably - Westworld, that started great and it went nowhere in the worst ways imaginable to the point that most people that stuck to the cancellation probably hate watched it.Hope they see the error of their ways or the big wigs above decide to can them and get some new people, better suited for the job.You should check this out."
1	Fallout is an adaptation of the eponymous gaming series which I am a fan of. It is overall a decent series but with some caveats. If you are not familiar with the setting you will feel lost, I saw it with my girlfriend and she had some issues following everything. Because, things aren't explained very well, it almost feels as if they expect the viewers to be familiar with the setting.The series biggest issue is the pacing, some of the middle episodes drag on a bit and it feels like barely anything happened. The ending is excellent with twists that somewhat redeems the rest of the series. Barely anything is revealed along the middle episodes and they have instead crammed everything on the final episode. I feel it would have been better if they had sprinkled some of these reveals and surprises in between the other episodes.I definitely recommend the series, but don't go in expecting an amazing one, you will definitely have a good time though. Expect to also be a bit confused during the series and expect to feel lost until the ending which will explain everything. A good series that could have been excellent 7/10.
2	The music this last season sounds like bending metal drums and cats being tortured, and it's so loud that I have to strain to hear what they are saying. Look, I get that they thought making the music more edgy (or whatever that pure trash is supposed to be) might make it more exciting but that only works if the music is (1) listenable, and (2) not competing with what's going on. On half of the action scene we just mute it because it's so grating. Does not make it more intense. Just makes it annoying. A ton of the music is just very very very poorly chosen.
0	"Brought to you by the very same people who couldn't end GoT properly, comes another strange adaptation of cult-classic books.For the record, no, Netflix did NOT in fact, 'do a 180' by showing the Cultural Revolution (which killed not one lone university professor, but instead saw 1.5 million people beaten to death or tortured to death in camps just because they were deemed academic bourgeois). The books in the first page are far more graphic and call a spade a spade: men and women have their head blown off by teenage bullies because ""Marxism"". But of course Netflix would never use the ""M"" word.Anyways after that little incursion in China, Netflix of course spends the other 9 episodes re-gendering every character (all strong characters are female, males are litteral doormats, one of them having qualms about complaining about getting friendzoned as he .. dies of cancer). In the book, everyone is Chinese, here, evidently, that cannot be - so you have one Indian, one Black (who smokes weed and drops acide while working a particle accelerator), one White (who is reckless loser , fat and stupid, and gets offed in episode 3 of course).And evidently, there's political commentary everywhere, which flies in the face of what the book was about. Heck, even ""Logic"" (the name of the ONE character in the books that considers betraying his people), has been transformed into an always-oppressed Latina woman who hapens to be a model and hates capitalism. She calls people 'fascists' when they take strong action and complains a lot about 'the men, the men'. . Oh and there's of course gay couples for no other reason that having gay couples.It's a joke, like everything netflix does. Don't be fooled and read the books instead."
2	i love this show with all my heartthere's so much drama and so many stories to follow it's awesomei hope ellen continues the show and it was cool to see the 400th episodewould recommend to others wouldn't watch it all again but i will continue to watch the new seasons.
0	I haven´t read the books but seriously, how boring and souless can you make something? Okay, it seemed to start good. I got interested in first 2 episodes. I really was expecting some cool sci-fi but instead rest of show is mostly just meaningless chats and drama about guy dying of sickness.I watched 4 episodes of Chinese version and it was so much better and felt much more accurate depiction. In Netflix they even remove the main character of book and divide him into several boring characters. Like why?I honestly hope it doesn´t get season 2. One of the most boring things i have watched in a while.
2	Probably, the first TV-show for me to really hammered down the feeling of alienation. The next science-fiction after The Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and Interstellar to be the pinnacle of the decade outer space exploration. And for the comparison, 3 Body Problem might just be the most faithfully detailed, science-oriented out of the three!Utilizing the length from its long episodic formation, this Interstellar shuttle admittedly won't launch with the flashiest exhaust at first, but burn slowly as it introducing the main circle of character, and getting us warm with how cold and distance the humanity are in this. But as soon as you get through the first two episodes, the trajectory of this unknown voyage would be as clear as the mystery of the vast night sky! As it's captured your curiosity on how alienated but familiar the whole concept is. It's as complicated as a quantum science could be, but not too proud or so distant that you can't wrap your head around it.As long as you can adapt your eyes on how allergic to colors the tone is, or how muddy sometimes the visual effects are, you'll be in a slow, but scenic ride with a lot to take for, while heading towards the proper, Secret Invasion!
2	First off never read the books however I am a great lover of science fiction stories.Every episode is gripping.- well maybe apart from 7 and its a good story with lots of twists and turnsMaybe some of the cast members really do not fit the stereotypes of a professor but you do warm to themIts a series where you cannot wait to watch the next episodeAnd i like that is based in the UK gives it a different feel that i likedThe quality of the production is first class and i love the setsThere is so much rubbish out there at the moment its nice to watch a good science fiction seriesPlease Netflix sign season 2 !!
0	The most underwhelming show I've seen in a long time. The beginning and first 5 episodes were great. It got me hooked pretty quickly and I binged through the whole show in two evenings. But with The Judgment Day episode it all went from a great 10/10 show to melodrama with bad writing and the plot turned in a completely different direction than was necessary.Sending a brain, our most valuable part to an alien species was apparently a great idea. And the execution? I wasn't surprised it failed. I was even glad it did.No NASA involvement, no actual scientists in the game. How did they expect Will to outsmart the aliens and somehow gather an intel for humans to later use as an advantage? Not even speaking about the fact that the sophons somehow were being used against humanity but at the same time just weren't. Why didn't they crash the plane Saul used later on? If they (the sophons) have the ability to control autonomous cars, why didn't they just turn off all power plants right away?I just hope this show gets scrapped and never picks up for another season. Just imagine the battle between San-Tchi and humans. Laughing already.I've never seen a show go from absolute peak to such a bad soap opera so quickly.
2	I gave one more star just for The Stunning B&W. Most of us are familiar with The story and its adaption in the past.So, What's new?Well, For starters, Andrew Scott. That was the reason enough for me to watch.I've seen and liked The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) very much. There are few more. All based on works of Patricia Highsmith (1955)Tom Ripley is an Imposter, An expert in forgery and If needed, A killer too. In short, A Psychopath.But very charming and likeable. And that's what helps him the most.This version of Ripley is Vulnerable. He struggles, Make a mess just like anyone else in his place. Even forgets his own identity in stress. He runs from place to place and we get to see Italy like never before.Cameraman Robert Elswit who won an Oscar for There Will Be Blood, Creates the same magic here.Ripley is Delightfully dark and Constantly Creepy.A must watch.
2	"For those upset that actual Portuguese isn't being spoken, you do realize that the entire show would be subtitled without turning Portuguese into English? Aside from when the main character is talking to himself it would be Subtitled Japanese and subtitled Portuguese and the show would not get nearly the same viewership and then sadly canceled. Having the English and Portuguese speak English helps keep the flow of each episode moving at a smooth pace.With that out of the way, great show so far, the main character is a little off with his performance from time to time but everybody else knocks it out of the park. Excited to see what the rest of the season gives us.Ps: those who ""read the book"" and are all Butthurt, just stop. Not just with this show, all adaptations. They can't do everything in the book, be happy you're getting quality content for the things you love, there are plenty of fans of other books who get terrible, poorly cast, cheap movie and television adaptions from people who have no idea what they're doing, The dark tower, Twilight, the hobbit etc. Be thankful for what you get."
0	Something that will pop out immediately after watching 30mins of first episode is how substandard character development is. If you somehow ignore and overcome that, you would be appalled with kindergarten dialogues and subpar acting as well as casting. Lead actress with her lip job looks more like a playboy model than a scientist.But what gets to you really hard is how meek and lowly scientists behave. I get it, this is Netflix quality production, which has to be alt left filled with cliches and dorky jokes so that the average westerner can enjoy this show while eating food which they got through their favorite food deliver app.Book or not, a topic like this needs deep intellect, resonance, and philosophy to realize it's importance - all of which are beyond Netflix's production values.I've moved on to the Chinese version and although I find the dialogues difficult to understand through subtitles, I do get enough substance to think and encapsulate this thought-provoking TV Show.I truly wish some other production house in North America would have picked the book for screenplay adaption. We might have actually got something which might have been even better than Tarkovisky's Stalker or Solaris.
2	Steps... glassware.... desk clerks... polizi inspectors... luggage... posted letters... and textures, oh those textures. Did I mention steps? These are the main characters and they appear throughout.First thing I noticed about Ripley was the black and white cinemaphotography, then the rough, old, peeling textures of Italian architecture. This 8-part series is all about ambience, with an immersive multiple-murder story layered over it. The acting was good throughout, and I especially liked that of the oh-so-suave and sophisticated Inspector Ravini, who, but for one Clouseau-like blunder which he doesn't discover until the end of this tale, almost gets his man. Yes, Ripley does indeed have talent, perhaps just not the same kind of talent as those Renaissance painters that he so admires. But definitely more talent than either Richard Greenleaf or Freddie Miles had. At least Marge could write, and because she had that talent, she may have been spared the same outcome that befell her former friends.
2	1. Why these days in every show is a common thing, that they kill or shut down almost the whole main characters. 2. Since Joe etc. generation of new characters, no one interesting was casted. 3. Latest generation of residents is...how can I say....THE WORST EVER OF ALL ON TV. 4. Too much gay sexual scenes. No need for this. 5. Why they always kill every bright moment for Hunt? 6. Not every person in real life has a drinking/drug problem. But in this show - almost everybody...they had worst history ever but somehow they become doctors - and the best ones even? 7. It looks that the writers is wrtiting so the show will be canceled. 8. Sorry for my english.
1	"Why Cosmo Jarvis?I mean all the other actors are flawless and the main character is acting so bad.I am speachless!I quote another review: ""The only thing that brings it down slightly for me is the terrible, hammy overacting of Cosmo Jarvis. I don't know if it's the script that was written for him or what, but his performance just comes off as so...unwatchable. It's like he's trying to do a third-rate channeling of Tom Hardy (who by the way would have been fantastic in this role, in my opinion). Every time Blackthorne opens his mouth I just want to cringe.""Everybody will compare Richard Chamberlain with him."
1	"'Grey's Anatomy' started off with a bang. Unforgettably witty lines, strong acting, and clever writing mark the first season as the show at its best. The characters are realistic and even the most shallow of the bunch eventually grow on the viewer. Patrick Dempsey in particular shines through as the charming Dr. ""McDreamy"". Notable performances are also delivered by Chandra Wilson, T.R. Knight, and Sandra Oh, although the rest of the cast generally holds their own as well. The cast does well taking us through the potentially dramatic (and highly fantasized) ups and downs of life as a medical professional.It could be argued that just as important as the humor and drama is the show's soundtrack. We're treated to a variety of largely independent artists that otherwise wouldn't find the ears of a mainstream audience. The songs are carefully selected based not only on whether or not they're good songs, but whether or not they actually fit the scenes they're in. And it shows. Poor song choices can easily ruin a scene and, luckily, 'Grey's Anatomy' has yet to do so.Unfortunately, the following seasons have not lived up to the expectations set by the first season. The second season was still good, although the show quickly began to lose its novelty about halfway through. The third season was a complete disaster, marked by poor writing choices. 'Grey's Anatomy' essentially became a younger, hipper version of 'General Hospital'. Although the acting and music remained strong, no amount of wit and charm could save the show from its own destructive, overly unrealistic writing. We can only suspend our disbelief for so long before seemingly random declarations of love and an unhealthy number of bombs and major accidents will begin to wear on us.The fourth season seems to have breathed a bit of new life into a dying series, bringing back some of the magic of the first season. However, it might not be enough to salvage the mess of the third season and the latter part of the second.Regardless, if you're looking for mindless enjoyment, you can't go wrong with 'Grey's Anatomy'."
2	As adaptations go, this month (March 24) has been a real winner. Firstly Dune Part 2, blockbustering it's way beyond all expectation whilst maintaining the essence of the book, and now 3 Body - potentially a disaster - succeeding against the odds.To compress the concepts, relocate much of the action, and condense the character range into a dynamic, watchable and comprehensible series really is quite a feat.Numerous changes (but nothing essential) to the OG Chinese hard scifi thrills have worked; all round fine acting seamlessly merges drama and science for any casual audience to engage.Of course, book fiends will have contentions - there's a few missing things I'd like to have seen myself regards the science expo - but overall it's credit where credit's due in pulling off a startlingly fine 8 episodes that cover the first book, and leave a buzz for what's to come.I watched the 30 episode, faithful, Chinese language adaptation by Tencent last year and can recommend it as well for a more measured, detailed beat by beat telling of the first book. A good comparison for this Netflix exercise.So I sincerely hope Netflix go ahead with the rest of the trilogy because it'll be quite a challenge to translate the futuristic, epoch-spanning events into relatable episodic TV.God knows we need some quality among the streaming service dross. After this pretty scintillating start to an 'unfilmable' literal epic, I'm looking forward to Season 2 immensely. Hurry up and announce it.
2	My thoughts from the first two episodes: This is a lavish production that's well worth seeing. But I strongly recommend reading the book and watching the original 1980 series. The casting for Father Sebastian, Father Alvito, Father Dell'Aqua and Captain Ferreira was better in the 1980 series. The current Rodrigues is well cast, but can't compare to John Rhys-Davies. Blackthorn is good but I notice his voice often sounds like Richard Burton 😊 The current version sort of glosses over the true depth of Yabu's perversion. I expect the current version will have more more time to be faithful to the novel since it is expected to over 10 hours compared to the original's 9 hours, but I wonder how many more plot changes we will see in coming episodes, e.g., the Captain General of the Erasmus didn't commit suicide, he died ashore of his illness; the tempest in which the galley taking Blackthorn to Osaka is virutally eliminated and the rescue of Rodriguez is overly simplified which is a shame since it is so central to the development of their friendship. Blackthorn's time in prison is also glossed over, again unfortunate since that is when he learns so much about the culture and language from the Friar. But, 8 more episodes to come. It will be an interesting ride :)
1	"When I began watching Grey's Anatomy I was single, dating and connected with the first round of characters that the show offered its audience. We were along for the journey with these young Doctors as they began their professional careers as well as their personal struggles with friendship and love. Fourteen seasons later, Grey's Anatomy has become a completely different show as we the audience has also changed. I am now married with children and at a similar time-line as some of the current cast members. It is for this reason that I am no longer a devoted fan. Having seen every episode since its pilot, I have finally questioned why I am still tuning in every week to watch the continuing adventures of Meredith Grey and her circle of friends and fellow doctors. Simple, it is no longer the same show I began to watch 14 seasons ago. Most of the character of the original show have left if not been killed off. The hospital has been set on fire, blown up, and taken hostage multiple times. We have seen love, lost, passion, promise, joy and sadness from multiple story lines throughout its run. Grey's Anatomy has reinvented itself so many times that we have seen its central figure (Meredith Grey) change for good and bad. From the single girl, the devoted daughter, the young doctor, the passionate girl friend, the on again off again good / bad friend, the angry daughter living in her Mom' shadow, the newly-wed, young mother, widower, lost adult and now, for lack of anything else, a supporting character to the show that graces her name. For this reason and the loss of so many of its prior cast members, I have found myself question time and time again when Grey's Anatomy ""jumped the shark."" Grey's Anatomy by default has inherited the generational audience of fans from such shows as St. Elsewhere, Chicago Hope and ER. The hospital drama has a home with Grey's Anatomy. When the show began, it was a home to a young cast of young professionals that were in multiple ""sexual"" relationships as they juggled their careers and side stories. Also, the show has taken a life of its own by juggling a much more diverse cast then it set out originally. With good and bad results, the solid fact remains that the current show does not reflect anything that the original show set out to be 14 seasons ago. While the show has created a multitude of amazing stories and moments for its audience to enjoy, I have lost that love and feeling many years ago. Now, I fear that after many years of hoping, wishing and praying, the show will not return to what it once was. It has tried several times to revive its cast to showcase this but has failed. Even during its second and third wind of new medical arrivals, only a handful have made the cut to the current cast while the large majority have disappeared if not written off the show. However, I am not angry at the overall show. Grey' Anatomy has (had) produced many good characters and stories back in the day. Thank you for the good times, which were many many seasons ago. Now, audience members have to make a tough decision. With that said, the show has struggled for an identity while holding onto several different aspects for a show. It has taken me this long to finally ""pull the plug"" and take Grey's Anatomy off of life support."
2	I love greys anatomy and it's one of my favorite shows, but please don't try to lengthen it more or you are going to ruin it. All the characters are either leaving or dying so please only make an amazing finale so everyone remember how good the first seasons were.
1	"I enjoyed about the first three or four shows, after that the series degenerated into romantic tragedy which is something I didn't expect. The first part of the series really sets you up for something great, but the finale is one of the worst finales I have seen since Ragnarok.The acting was pretty good except for the actress who played ""Auggie"". I found her performance to be canned and flat at best. The other actors covered for her most of the time so it's not too much of an issue.I guess if I could sum up anything is that this is not a Science Fiction TV show. It's more a romantic drama which, towards the end, really pours on the schmaltz and sentiment.The whole ""Wallfacers"" thing is completely incomprehensible and not flushed out at all. But at that point in the show it's a lost cause anyway.I probably will not tune in to Season 2 because I really don't care what happens to the characters."
2	Well I've binged the first four episodes,and requiring sleep,so finish tomorrow, so far...The cast a few members from GOT,plus next generation actors,same script writers,so I reckon curiosity dragged viewers in.May investigate the books,one of the actors who is prominent so far was in another hard science sci-fi movie UFO Alex Sharp..... very thoughtful clever movie,low budget but gripping.Benedict Wong playing a mid character spook with his homegrown Lancashire drawl Liam Cunningham usual salty language,lot of Anglo-Saxon expletives from most of the characters,so reminiscent of GOT flavour.I do like the 1960's historical references to the cultural revolution in China,and the effect of martial law by the military upon the general population.However whoever's in power in history,profit is always on the agenda,all the human aspects of plagiarism,deceit, and misuse of power.An exercise in futuristic virtual game play is now in use but really an alien recruitment ploy to get earthling followers and acolytes.Episode 5 is the big reveal,hard science required to solve the riddles The Alien visitors somehow manipulate the internet,and reveal their existence to the world at large, using communication hi tech software, light years ahead of Earth There is great spectacular cgi in this episode,gruesome,and cutting edge.... They will arrive in 400 years........ News clips with our present world leaders shown ...a cheap trick.World leaders then decide to fund the science for new technology.And invest in future science and engineering But as usual the problem will be someone else's future to solve The general population are frightened into conformity The big finale ,the engineering and science fall over, borrowed heavily from1960's actual science projects ,using nuclear blast propulsion in outer space Fast space travel not quite there yetI suppose it's popular enough for a second season...?..
0	I Fellout of my couch because i had fallen asleep in episode three. Was it because it was boring? Was it because it was insipid? Was it because it was so contrived? Was it because all the actors were bland, not only unbelievable but unrelatable? I am convinced it was of all the above.Pro: Looks bright and colorful.Cons: CG is smeared on some of the creatures and looks almost as bad as the Scorpion King movie. Too plastic and silly moving. Especially the mutated bear. It looks awful.Walton Goggings is Walton no matter the role. Whether it be in The Shield, SOA, Fallout, He is always going to be Walton.The lead is silly, annoying and unbelievableThe music is atrocious. At first it is novel and cute but by the middle of episode one the Yankovich style covers get really old really fast. The rest of the old re-hashed songs of the 40s and 50s just get mind numbingly trite.The writing in very lazy. We have to go here to see this but first have to do this and see that before we can actually do anything. Just terribly lazy.The rest of the cast is exactly what we Hollywood has been directed to feed us.... No substance or relatable traits.Easy pass on this one.
2	For me, a very well constructed and conducted series.Beautiful shots and interesting (alternative to the famous Shougun from 1980) plot conducting.I would rate the whole thing 10 however there is a 'but' - the main character or rather the character created by Cosmo Jarvis.Flat acting, all emotions in 3 sets of faces, dialogues as if read from a prompter (those in English). From episode to episode it gets worse and worse because ... all the same alle the time regardless of the emotion of a scene. Too bad!I'm very sorry Mr. CJ, but unfortunately ... in the whole series he is the weakest part of the show.Nevertheless, I recommend and encourage you to watch.I, certainly longing for good acting, and I am going back to Shogun with Richard Chamberlain.
1	An overall masterpiece but the last two seasons are just inexplicably dumb. Bad writing all over. Bad decisions at every step. The moment the show got ahead of the books it all went downhill. Still worth watching, especially seasons 1-4.
0	I been watching this show since it started and I absolutely about done with it. The new seasons stink. To political and brings up how white people are awful.I know a lot of people who are done watching it and I. Am as well.
0	Wow.... i am shocked, and lacking the words to describe the level of disappointment in regards to the final season and the finale of this series...Used to think this was a work of art... now I am astonished at the incompetence of the writers and D&D for destroying everything about this story.Truly sad and monumentally disappointing.
1	The last few seasons are just some phrases transcribed from popular psychology books, with no actual characters. So bad and fabric.
2	It was a master piece i have ever seen.it was gripping
1	This was the worst season of game of thrones I had watched.
2	Season 7 and 8 made remove two of ten stars. Illogical scenes, things done in a rush, D&D are probably going to do some garbage with Stars Wars too since they don't have any book or something to inspire their work.
2	It had everything, good things and bad things. I'm being disappointed and greatful at the very same time..!If you for some reason haven't seen it do so!!
0	The writing went downhill after they ran out of material the latest season 8 seems like it was written by a 6 year old too predictable and cliche, super disappointing dont waste your time watching this show. i learned it the hard way after having spent 10years on this show. I feel sorry for the cast, their efforts are overshadowed by the poor sctipts of the writters.
1	Only one episode out and this show teases with realistic plot line, romance from the get-go, and of Course Nathan Fillion, who in my book can do no wrong. It's refreshing to have him back in the network line-up. My only criticism so far is actor Eric Winter in the role of Training Officer Tim Bradford. His Christopher Walken alter-ego got tired within the first 25 minutes. Hope it goes away in future episodes. I have not seen his other work so don't know if he is always like this. Reminds me of how tiresome Christian Slater has always been with his channeling Jack Nicholson. But I will put up with a lot of irritation to be able to spend an hour a week with Nathan Fillion. So glad he's back!!
1	I was interesting in seeing how a terrific screen writer.would take a terrific book and convert it into a mini series. There is obviously a huge difference between screen writing and series writing. This show does not make the transition. While Ripley and friends make deep interesting characters Steve Zallian miscast the series or rather chose to use uncharismatic performances which leads to dull show. Fillers include lots of foot action on beach to villa stairs, letter writing, sharp unnecessary camera angle and to top it black and white which takes away from contrasts of hell in a NYC hotel room and heaven in the Italian town. Zallian did a good job with IN THE NIGHT a number of years ago however that show was almost scene for scene a remake of a British show. The added foot issues that Tuturro faced did not engage us. Without a series to pace him here Zallian fails at pacing. The characters are quite morose and really not that interesting unfortunately. Sorry to see a great story go to such waste. Sorry Steve.
2	I am very skeptical about eastern films but this principle is soon to be altered after seeing Shogun. I believe this latest historically inspired genre brings more elating and electrifying feelings behind the screens. It starts by enjoying the captivating sound mix and background score which together ripples the film's frequency to scintilate a purposeful masterpiece. The historical essence portrayed perfectly by precise costumes and well prepared landscapes drive the desire to travel back in time. Perphaps it is the motionary Osaka that wakes the joy of wanting to belong in the past. I see this film to be well written, acted and produced to meet the needs of historical drama lovers just like myself, and I can boldly put on record here that this is the best Japanese themed movie ever made on screen. There is no hiding the fact that Shogun is a must watch piece if you call yourself a movie lover!
2	This is like many dramatic tv shows, and like many hospital shows to be fair. But Grey's Anatomy feels a lot more different than any other hospital tv drama.
2	I didn't know what to make of this mini-series from the previews. It seemed underwhelming. And Robert Downey Jr. Looked all the bit of a caricature.However, realizing Park Chan-wook was involved, heavily gave me all the faith needed to fully invest. His work on the original Old Boy, Sympathy for Mr Vengence and Thirst brought Korean Cinema into its golden age, two decades ago.The Sympathizer itself has the hallmarks of a Chan-wook film. The absurd, yet believable and charming characters. The constant sense of dread and a plot that feels like it can punish someone you are starting to care for, very quickly.Excited to see where the series goes and feeling confident it's going to be good with its source material being a Pulitzer Prize winner.
0	"I certainly hope that Michael Crichton's estate sued Shonda Rhimes for ripping him off. Any compelling story-line was explored on ER a decade before the promiscuous and absurd ABC medical ""drama"". While ER attempted to bring some of the gritty reality of medicine to tv, Grey's only real contribution to the genre is art of hair styling."
0	If you want to see a good adaptation of the famous novel by Patricia Highsmith, then avoid this series and watch either (or both): -Purple Soon (Plein Soleil): an amazing French movie, -The Talented Mr Ripley: not as good but still very good and a great cast (Matt Damon, Jude Law, Phillipe Seymour Hoffman).I this Ripley series, the acting is very flat, the characters are not credible, the rhythm is very slow, I am not sure why they decided for black & white, which doesn't add any value. The 'dolce vita' feel of the movies is totally absent. Even if you watch it at 1.5x speed, it's still boring.
1	"Overhyped show. So much potential wasted here. Bad lead European cast. Sets are OK, costumes are credible, sitting in chairs or cross legged is NOT credible for Japanese during 750 AD. Japanese male cast is better. Mariko actress is OK , but better actress, script, & no modern agenda would've improved this series greatly.Some reviewers claim this is next GOT. Def NO. GOT had well known Brit actors/ actresses & unknowns in 1st ep. GOT was global hit bc it's FANTASY with dragons, magic, based on European history. Plus Old HBO had most creative producers, & diverse cast bc they FIT character & could ACT- no political agenda. GOT would never be made now.Here, the lead Englishman male does Tom Hardy ""Mad Max Fury Road"" impression at times. He's not charismatic nor believable. NO prisoner SCREAMS out temper tantrum continually at LEADER of one's captors, esp after witnessing beheadings of natives from samurai swordsmen, & how Japanese ppl act in reverence when in presence of same samurai.Here, the Japanese male lead cast is better but too much importance is placed on Mariko & esp her Catholic beliefs. All Daughters must honor their father's by unquestionable obedience - a duty that remains in modern Japan.The 1980s show was such a huge hit bc of Richard Chamberlain, good script with author's input, realism of male dominance & correct male chauvinism in Japan that also existed GLOBALLY in 750 AD. Yet, the 1980s hit show insulted every American Japanese person I knew. I read the book too- enjoyable fictional tale of Japan from white westernized male view.In real history, Japan distrusted all European missionaries / foreigners, incl Christian religion. These Europeans believed daily bathing caused lethal flue, were riddled with body lice & diseases unknown to Japanese. Europeans were kept on a guarded special island and killed if they left it without escorted permission.Here, I've seen both new released eps. It's average for THIS era. Shame lead ""Englishman"" & Catholic priest are lame. The subtitles are fast a few times & do not bother me. But knowing so much about Japan from close friends, having read bestselling book, studied Japan's history, & remembering original TV massive hit with Chamberlain, causes this series to be a disappointment bc so much potential was discarded. A good story already exists.Thus, Watchable, but not really memorable like the original series nor book."
2	"Not sure why, but I just clicked on reviews to date & read through the recent reviews & felt I should say something. Grey's just had its 15th, moving to its 16th season. What do you expect, of course there will be (a) season(s) less exciting than when it started. Loads of material, story lines to try out, new types of characters then. You should give the writers and actors credit for still being able to keep the viewers attention to enjoy Grey's. I do, they have mine. I enjoy this show, it still makes me laugh, I look forward to see the next episode & what will happen next season. And above all, they didn't go into the negative, like ""Suits"". That's what I like. Sure, it is not always realistic when it comes to the life & work of real surgeons, but we knew that a long long time ago, but who cares. I don't think it was ever meant to be about that. Unfortunately most of the characters leaving the serie died, so they can't come back. I hope there will be some new characters next season to bring a bit of new life into this show that's been part of many peoples for many years."
1	"I believe most changes made from the books by Cixin Liu are good ones for an adaptation like this. I do have gripes with the show. Casting choices. Mainly Eiza Gonzalez and the other scientist. I'm sorry, but Eiza is just a very unbelievable scientist. Her acting is very one dimensional... basically one emotion, anger and disappointment. At all times. Her angular and artificially sculpted face is a huge distraction for me. It's as if they decided to just ""put a young hot chick"" as the lead. It's ridiculous.I also feel the series does not feel as EPIC as it should. While reading the books, it just felt so epic and the stakes were so incredibly high. This does not feel that way, at least not yet. I believe with a little better use of exposition in the story, this could have been achieved. The books are educational, even if not on purpose. This series focuses more on the adventurous points of this tale, which is honestly are the less interesting aspects. The themes of the original story that Cixin Liu wrote are very scientific, philosophical, and complex. The Netflix series feels a bit dumbed down for a lazier audience.Still, I do find it to be somewhat entertaining. I can't help it because it's a cool story. It does feel a bit rushed though. The first season could have used 4 more episodes and brought in some things they omitted from the book to raise the stakes and make it feel more epic.If you're loving this, I'm happy for you! It's not bad. Maybe I would more if I hadn't have read the books. I highly recommend the books if you like this series, because so far I have to say they are the superior version of the story."
1	Fallout is one of the best video game adaptations to exist, however, some of the acting and writing in the show takes you out of the feel of the show that it strives greatly to achieve. I felt the writing around Maximus's character was sub par compared to the rest of the show, his acting also felt very shoehorned. All this to say, the show is great and had perfect vibes one would expect from a Fallout adaptation. Ella Purnel was a huge standout and highlight of the show, her acting was great along with being the only character who felt like a real person, other than Walter Goggins most characters felt very one-dimensional and barely had a character at all, Ella Purnel and Walter Goggins made up for this however.
2	The attention to details spread throughout from the game are greatly appreciated. The story was good, but for a fan of the game, seeing this world come to life was the real win. The world of Fallout is quirky and weird and the show captured that. This is meant to be true to that, not an adaptation to anything plausible beyond the world created in the games. For me that's a win.Memorable characters and tons of cameos tell you how beloved the franchise is. Lots of known actors are happy to play bit roles, just to be a part of this project. It's not for everyone, I'm sure, but if you liked the games and you want to see it come to life, you'll enjoy this. I know I did.
1	Loved the first 2 seasons but really can't watch it anymore. When he had to apologize to college kids for not letting them know he was a cop because it ruined their safe space classroom it just lost me. Be as woke as you want but I just want to chill to an entertaining show.
2	Love everything about this adaptation. The cast, the locations and the slow burn to get to where we are going.Firstly - if you have a Oled 4K tv, this is a must see. The cinematography is brilliant.whoever shot this deserves every award going.- just stunning.the decision to go with black and white was brave ,but pays off handsomely.At first I thought this was going to be a hard slog - it is not the fastest paced show out there. But now i relish every second of screen time. The look between characters in certain scenes says so much without the need for dialogue.lead actors are just perfect.i have four episodes to go and dreading the end.well done to all involved.
0	"A One-Star ReviewIn the realm of post-apocalyptic fiction, ""Fallout"" has long held a revered status, capturing the imaginations of gamers worldwide with its rich storytelling, immersive world-building, and morally complex narratives. So, when news broke of a television adaptation, anticipation ran high. However, the resulting series, while bearing the name ""Fallout,"" is a far cry from the beloved franchise it purports to represent.From the outset, ""Fallout"" fails to grasp the essence of its source material, opting instead for a shallow imitation that squanders its potential at every turn. The show's premise follows a group of survivors navigating the wasteland of a nuclear apocalypse, reminiscent of the game series' setting. However, any semblance of depth or nuance is swiftly abandoned in favor of uninspired clichés and derivative storytelling.One of the most glaring shortcomings of ""Fallout"" is its treatment of characters. Rather than crafting compelling personalities with genuine arcs and motivations, the series relies on tired stereotypes and cardboard cutouts. The protagonist, a rugged survivor with a heart of gold, embodies every tired trope of the genre without adding anything new or interesting. Supporting characters fare no better, serving as little more than plot devices to move the narrative forward without any real depth or development.Furthermore, ""Fallout"" squanders its potential for thought-provoking commentary on the human condition in the face of adversity. Instead of exploring complex themes of morality, survival, and the consequences of our actions, the series opts for cheap thrills and superficial conflict. Any attempts at social commentary feel half-hearted at best, overshadowed by the show's relentless focus on spectacle over substance.Visually, ""Fallout"" is a mixed bag, with inconsistent production values and lackluster special effects. While some scenes manage to evoke the desolate beauty of a world ravaged by nuclear war, others feel cheap and poorly executed, betraying the show's limited budget and lack of creative vision. Moreover, the decision to rely heavily on CGI for its more ambitious sequences only serves to highlight the series' technical shortcomings, resulting in jarring moments of disconnect for the audience.Narratively, ""Fallout"" suffers from pacing issues and a lack of direction, meandering aimlessly from one plot point to the next without ever building meaningful tension or momentum. Subplots are introduced and promptly abandoned, characters disappear without explanation, and the overall story arc feels disjointed and unsatisfying. By the time the season finale rolls around, it's hard to shake the feeling that ""Fallout"" has squandered its potential for a truly engaging narrative in favor of shallow spectacle and empty action.Ultimately, ""Fallout"" is a disappointment on every level, failing to capture the essence of the beloved video game franchise it seeks to emulate. From its one-dimensional characters to its lackluster storytelling and subpar production values, the series falls short of even the most modest expectations. Fans of the games will find little to love here, while newcomers will likely be left scratching their heads at the hype surrounding this lackluster adaptation.In conclusion, ""Fallout"" is a prime example of how not to adapt a beloved property for the small screen. Lacking in creativity, depth, and originality, the series is a disservice to fans of the franchise and a missed opportunity for meaningful storytelling. With its derivative plot, cardboard characters, and lackluster production values, ""Fallout"" is best avoided by all but the most die-hard enthusiasts of post-apocalyptic fiction. In a crowded landscape of television offerings, this one-star disappointment is best left to fade into obscurity."
0	I had given it 10/10 rating but now I've changed it to 1/10 and posting here a question for the mighty D&D: Why the hell does King Bran needs a Master of Whisperers when he knows everything??
2	Being an enormous fan of the 1999 film, I was dubious about this. However, I adore it. So slow but completely mesmerising, I can't take my eyes off it.I loved Eliot Sumner's 'Freddie Miles' who was such a contrast to the brash portrayal by Philip Seymour Hoffman (whose version I also loved) and Andrew Scott is wonderful as the almost personality free Ripley.The only slight downside for me were the portrayals of Marge and Dickie, who fell short for me of the film versions. Whilst I appreciate this is a very different take on the story, Jude Law's version of Dickie Greenleaf as a cocky, spoiled, arrogant but wholly charismatic and attractive rich boy was much better in my opinion. I'm coming round to Dakota Fanning's Marge!Beautifully shot in stunning locations, this version of the story has been done very, very well. I love it.
0	Season 1 and 2 were fantastic. Decent story, predictable at times but still entertaining and fun to watch. Season 3 has been a disaster.
1	"TL;DR Once one of the best TV shows in history with the ending so bad that I can't recommend anyone to watch it and invest their time in it.It's hard to even go online these days and google ""Game of Thrones"" without bumping into articles or even memes about how the show declined in quality with every season. And unfortunately, it is all true.While the directors D&D had to adapt the books, this show was a piece of art. Amazing visuals, great acting, stunning soundtrack, smart dialogue, a true modern day TV wonder which leaves you in awe and makes you appreciate the whole cast and crew. After 4 seasons, when they had to come up with the original content since they ran out of books to adapt, the show started to fall off. Rushed pacing, less impressive dialogue, but the plot was still interesting and production was getting even better. Season 7 was a bit of a mess, yet still at moments enjoyable. Unfortunately it was only a taste of what was coming with season 8.Season 8 is where it all went downhill. Pacing so rushed that almost each episode could be a season of its own, all the logic previously shown, all the character developments, foreshadowing of plots, tension buildups, absolutely everything that they built for 8 years has been thrown out of the window for the sake of some visually impressive but rushed mindless spectacle, culminating in the worst and most illogical ending I ever saw in any TV show, including infamous endings of Lost and Dexter. Season 8 is the reason why I rate this 5 instead of at least 9. Season 8 is the reason why I see no point in ever rewatching this series as I sometimes do with some of my favourite shows. Season 8 is the reason I could never recommend this show to someone who hasn't watched it, because I can't tell someone to invest their time into something that ends so poorly. Season 8 should for ever go down in history as an example for young generations of directors, to show that no matter how good of a show you make, bad decisions can ruin years of hard work of everybody on that set. And those people are the ones I am the most sad about."
1	Finally after all these years, it's over, and despite the bad taste in your mouth, you can say that this series is unique.GoT started an incredible movement that we have never seen before, millions of fans obsessed about every detail and moment in every episode, and with a good justification. The series is amazing, full of complex and intriguing characters, with extremely fantastic and iconic moments difficult to expect, a certain magical realism gives it a different flavor between all the series and plunges us into a fantasy world dark and amazing, unmatched in its level of rawness and fantastic narrative.However, the series has ended, passing through fantastic moments, I must also say that much declined, despite the effort and great emotion that caused, the end of the series, a series that for years was strengthened based on his loyal fans and narrative fantasy, has ended, and was disappointing.To make it clear, this series is worth seeing completely, despite its later failures, the first 6 seasons are absolutely incredible, its seventh season feels a little more mixed but still enjoyable ... the problem is the eighth, which was supposed to be a wonderful ending to a wonderful series, I end up being just an over-exploitation of ideas argued on the basis of ''unexpected''. They tried to give surprises to the viewers, but ended up being unpleasant surprises without sense, without logical reason or at least chained to the decisions and motivations of past characters. Even the protagonists admitted this roughly.But despite this, GoT left a big mark in the history of television, with spectacular moments and full of intricate action. Had it not been for the great disappointment of its last season, this series would be remembered as a milestone, a glorious finale to a deserving series, but this only ended up being an ''end'' and that's it. Well, a bad ending actually.Even so, enjoy it, the first seasons are pure fantasy gold, you will love every second.
2	Have played all the associated game titles, starting 30 years ago, and outright love the concept of human greed, moral dilemmas, satire, gore, etc. To my joy, the TV series is 95% true to the games, incl. Character progression, stores and NPCs, factions, companions, environments, details and soundtrack - excellent and above expectations. ...extra credits for re-creating Red Rocket.The big difference compared to the games, is that the TV series is of high production quality ...maybe Bethesda will pick up a few pointers?The TV series isn't following a specific game title but seem to somewhat mix from each, which I find perfectly fine. Similarly, flashbacks are used in a good way for story and character build-up. The pace of the story ought to leave plenty of room for additional seasons.
0	Couldn't get past the first half of the first episode. Firstly, the physics is just complete garbage, not believable at all if you have an undergrad level knowledge of sub-atomic physics (which I can only assume the original author does not).Secondly, if all the particle accelerators in the world suddenly started showing bonkers results they would absolutely not be closing any of them down. It just makes no sense - the single most significant set of scientific readings ever recorded, and they shut down the science? It would be all anyone was taking about, everywhere, because we'd all be expecting the universe to come to a catastrophic end at any moment.I don't mind a bit of poetic licence in my Sci-fi. Not everything has to be consistent with contemporary science, and not everyone has to behave as we'd expect, but this is just bad writing.
2	Loved the first 6 seasons, season 7 was good but i truly wish i hadn't seen the last season. Everything was rushed, most things made no sense, bad character development and it left me with a bad taste. In episode 3 of season 8 there was not enough lighting, the way the night king went down was really frustating especially after his true intentions were never shown.i miss I really hope for a miracle to happen from HBO to remake the last season. Dan and david are the real villains in this show.
2	1-6 seasons were 10/10. 7th season was meh ok. 8 season was garbage.Highly recommend 1-6 seasons. Just stop watching there. Immagine what could be the end.
0	Season 3 quickly became so politically correct and hostile toward white people I can't watch it anymore, so for that reason I give this show one star.
1	"Just finished 4:I disliked the first episode, 2nd episode was good, 3rd got great, 4th makes me watch more.Good: great Sci-FI plot. Good twists & turns, great CGI (when needed). Some senior characters are great.Average: Pacing is very average. Things are rushed way too quickly.Background score is average.Purely bad: ""Scientists"" who make the main characters are very very bad. I just stopped pretending they are scientists. I look at them as teenage highschoolers now.Character development is awful. I have seen many deaths and none of them made an impact.I so wish the story was portrayed with more seriousness & casting of main scientists were different.I would still finish it. But definitely a BIG missed opportunity."
1	This has been the most amazing show I have watched. I would wait and wait for the episode to come on. After season 7 I was excited to start this again and then huge disappointment. Everything happened so fast and the ending was terrible. Ruined it for me and many others.
0	Kudos to D&D for ruining best show ever. You can thank this review to your last episode which completely destroyed all the joy I ever had in watching this show. Ashes you made in Kings landing is exactly what happened to your show.
0	"Very lacklustre writing after that, just repeating storylines. Apparently people make life changing decisions on a whim, depending on who they are in ""love"" with that week.Random characters appear and disappear to fill in gaps, but with little backstory or interactions. I actually feel sorry for the actors having to read some of this dialogue, although it must be easy to learn their lines as they were from an earlier episode.The first five seasons are just ""ok"". If you are expecting something enthralling like Code Black or ER I would go and re-watch those instead. This just gets worse and worse after time."
0	A lot of writers today have lost their creativity. I don't blame the actors, they are doing their job, but unfortunately it's so boring.
1	With a great book(s) behind this and already existing Chinese version, you would expect higher quality of the series.But no, few miscasts make many scenes painful to watch and completely break the immersion into the story.Eiza González playing Auggie Salazar, one of the main characters, is a terrible actress; her wooden performance can be used in D production easily, but not here. Emotional range of a plank with two possible expressions - worried and afraid, and nothing in between is difficult to place into any serious conversation. Every scene with her is painful to watch and fast forwarding turned out to be a solution for this.Another actor, Jovan Adepo, playing Saul Durand, is permanently out of place, and role of his character is not clear, although he is billed as a top actor of the series. Supposedly smartest scientist alive at 31, Saul is not more than a useles friendly buddy with a vocabulary of a middle schooler and permanent filler between the scenes. Could do without the character altogether.Series in general have great potential and story is building up permanently, it's a good sci-fi.Sorry for the rant, but casting director should have been fired.
1	Season 8 is really trash . It is really bad and disappoint. As a fan , I feel sad about it has to come to this end.
1	The first 6 seasons are great even the 8 are very entertaining, but the 9 and further are just a way to maintain alive these series, but is already over, some episodes you will don't know if are new or old because are the same, not new cases and the new storyline very boring in my opinion, watch the series and when you get bored stop, because it will not get better.
0	This show is best until the worst last episodes come. Really dissappointed with the end
1	It's amazing how after 6 breathtaking seasons we get slowly to season 7 and then season 8 that really makes you regret watching anything. I can't understand that someone develops characters for 6-7 seasons and then destroys them completely. So sad...
0	I, like many others, started watching this with my gf. I actually loved it and continued watching it religiously even after that relationship ended.The show has gone up and down throughout the years, but it's always come around in the end... That was true up until a couple years ago. The show used to be nuanced, focusing on the story and using a soft touch to help push a moral narrative. Well that's gone.It is now so unbelievably preachy and completely lacks any sense of self awareness. I live perfectly in the middle of the political and social landscape. I always support people's personal choices yet this feels so gross and heavy handed. It's almost as if they decided to remove the fourth wall and turn it into a pulpit.No one wants to watch a fictional cable drama that constantly brings up extremely controversial political and societal topics. We used these shows to escape the current unrest, not to be preached at about it.They are treating their audience as if they are idiots, and (somehow) believe that their writing will enlightened them. It's hard to imagine how they got to this level of arrogance and grandiosity, it's truly hard to fathom.
1	Same like everyone else's thoughts. Watch the show till season 5. And then read the rest of the books. Don't bother with seasons 6, 7 and 8
1	Lots of laughter and tears for the first 10 seasons. I was my teenage favorite show. But now, they are still dragging this show. Please just end it on a good note.
2	I would really like to rate higher than an 8, but my biggest complaint is that they didn't do enough to bring non gamers up to speed. As a fan of the game franchise I really liked the show. My wife who's never played was totally lost.The best solution they could still do is add in a short video, maybe in the animated pip boy style that educates the viewer on the wasteland. Approach it with the concept of someone that knew nothing about the series.For the show itself, I really liked it. The cgi looks pretty good. The acting has been excellent. So far (about halfway through) the writing has been just as good as the games. I would honestly give this a 10/10 IF they could find a way to bring in viewers that know nothing about the franchise without getting them completely confused as to what's going on.
2	I cannot say enough about this show! I thought was going to get sick of it and there have definitely times I have been pissed at it, but when push comes to shove once I find out the premiere date for the next episode I am dying with anticipation! When it ends I will accept it graciously, but I will be very sad about it!
1	Good show for a bored/lazy Saturday day or night just enough non threatening heart racing moments and plenty of corney laughable moments and more if you're slightly keen...
1	Great start. The parts in communist China are interesting. The entire premise is intriguing.The acting is mostly good.I liked Rodriguez's non-glamorous role. Liam Cunningham is agreeably garrulous.But then increasingly nonsensical elements begin. The sci-fi becomes unrealistic and magicalThe virtual reality games are quite mundane & irrelevantThe attack on the ship, slicing it up, is spectacular but ridiculous.The rocket sent to meet up with the aliens makes no sense.The magical electrons that can do anything & envelope the whole world ... erEven though the aliens can hack any tech all the good guys get onto a plane together.And then series 1 just ends.Nah. Won't be bothering with series 2, assuming it gets made.
0	Every year, I have watched a single episode just in case it got better. It never has. I like medical procedural dramas, but Grey's Anatomy disgusted me every time. If this is how doctors conducted themselves on the job, they would expect to be fired &/or lose their licenses. The characters are shallow and unbelievable. I hate to think that people watch this and think this is how human beings relate to each other, communicate, and conduct themselves in the workplace.
0	Season 8 has completely destroyed every character arc therefore, everything built since season 1 has been ruined.
0	It is not known what is worse, the choice of actors or the script.I don't know what to write about such a bad series. I only wish that someone who really enjoys a good series, and it is a SF genre, then had to watch a series called Fringe, and not waste several hours on this complete nonsense, in every sense.While watching episode 8, waiting for it to end as soon as possible, I took to typing this comment. Oh, and the direction is just as bad as everything else.And IMDB exaggerates with such a mandatory number of characters. When something is very weak, such as this series, then what to write about.
0	How thi is getting 8 stars, I'll never understand. Fillion probably bought some indians to vote.  TL;DR: You have better things to do with your time than watch this, trust me.
0	I just watched reruns of the last, then the first of ER which was an amazing show, setting the standard for all medical show that followed including Grey's Anatomy. GA is so stupid, yet I continue to watch. Oh well.
1	I have never read the source material so I have no insights on how it compares to the novel or even the other adaptation. I have tried to watch this series with a completely open mind and no expectations. With that said, I actually enjoyed the first 5 episodes of this series and would give them 7.5/10. I watched a lot of episodes in one weekend. However, the show starts to lose steam and struggle after the fifth episode.This series has had some issues from the beginning but I was willing to overlook them to see where the compelling story was headed. Some of the plot points and concepts are very interesting but the execution in showcasing them can often fall short. Sometimes scenes are great, other times there are glaring issues. The problem is that many of these issues are amplified 10x in episode 6 and beyond.After the big revelation, the episodes mostly become a melodrama about uninteresting characters. Many of them don't seem to actually care about the events that just unfolded or the main plot line. They are too busy being involved in their own personal problems rather than putting all of that aside to focus on what is most important. The main scientist friends group drama is mind numbingly boring to watch at times.Jin and Auggie can be arrogant and obnoxious. This is extremely off putting as most of their esteem seems completely unearned. These characters are not believable as accomplished scientists. There are millions of scientists and other intelligent people that apparently can't keep up with an alcoholic that never does any work or a physicist that has nothing going for her other than a boyfriend out of her league.This supposedly brilliant duo of elite scientists does their level best to show you how naive or immature they are. They make disparaging remarks against Raj and Wade while acting like moody teenagers. Raj and Wade are both intelligent, cogent and exude competence. Wade carries his scenes so well and is a pleasure to watch. Wade is clearly focused on what is important and is actually trying to win a war of survival.Meanwhile, the 2 most brilliant women are seemingly irreplaceable but can't decide if their values line up with the men enough to help save humanity from extinction. Auggie is beyond insufferable and Jin is mostly bland. Thankfully, there are some great characters and plot points to work with. I hope they trim the worst elements as they have the recipe here for a great series.
0	I don't know how, this season was made in the first place,this season just ruined the whole show did they really read the script daam all the credits goes to the creator's
0	Grey anatomy season 14 is so boring and so awful especially this season I have stop completely watching it for good. Grey should have ended after season 10. Grey Anatomy seasons I love and have watch are seasons 1-10. after season 10 the show has gone downhill . Grey Anatomy need to ends after season 14.
0	Tried to stick it out until the end but just can't do it any longer. I'm not interested in politics - I watch to be entertained, not irritated. The characters all sound the same, have the same emotions, expressions, and attitudes. The writing is terrible. The whole COVID season (2020-2021) is depressing and insulting. I'm done. I should have quit many seasons ago.
0	"So, I recently watched ""The Rookie"", and I have to say that it's a decent show. The production quality is good, and the cast is solid. Nathan Fillion's performance as John Nolan is particularly impressive, and the show's action scenes and suspenseful moments are well-executed.However, I did notice that the show has a lot of political messaging, especially when it comes to law enforcement. Some episodes highlight issues like police brutality and systemic racism within law enforcement, which are important issues to address. But at times, I felt like the show was too heavy-handed in its approach and lacked a balanced perspective.Additionally, some viewers have criticized the show for having an anti-police bias, which I can understand. While it's important to highlight the flaws within law enforcement, I think it's equally important to show the positive aspects of police work as well.Overall, I'd say that ""The Rookie"" is worth checking out if you enjoy police procedural dramas. However, if you're looking for a show that doesn't have a political agenda, this might not be the best choice for you."
1	First, in terms of medical accuracy this show is not really relevant, but if this show is supposed to be good because of the characters, unfortunately this excuse runs flat later as it was always pretty weak.The first seasons' cast functioned okay together because each character was at least interesting, and worked by far as the best part of the show when it started. The second season was decent too, adding to the new dynamics established previously in new ways. Sadly as time goes on any new or interesting characters that capture any attention die off or leave the show for some reason.Because of the volatility of how characters get switched in and out due to actor contracts, staying invested in the show over a long period of time fails to draw me in because there's a strong chance that in a season or two they could just disappear if I liked them.Also unfortunately, the show's best characters Christina Yang, Mark Sloan, and Lexie Gray as well as many others are no longer part of the main cast. It seems only four or so characters from the original cast are still part of the show. The worst part of the show is that it really had some compelling drama in the sense that characters who'd been around since the beginning of the show were struggling, even if they were very mundane, unrealistic, tension-less, and cliche problems, but now it doesn't matter anymore because:These characters acted more like bratty teenagers instead of medical professionals as time went on, except for Doctor Webb who luckily is still around but is not enough to save the show.I'm still not fully caught up, but it seems now the writing, on top of being un-engaging and derivative of other better and more accurate medical shows like it was from the start, now has daily politics included.Overall: a failing grade, 5/10. In the beginning, the show was popcorn melodrama with some actual medicine here and there but that soon faded as it was just barely getting by by the skin of it's mediocre teeth. The soap drama was at least fun in a stupidly corny Adam West Batman way before, now it's just unending and hopeless as characters are switched in and out like an RPG depending on the season.
1	Nathan Fillion is one of the best leading men on TV with no doubt. He puts so much heart and talent into his projects. The problem is with the rest of the cast and the script. 20 minutes of Nathan Fillion is not worth the other 25 minutes of boring characters.
2	This show made me addicted to it. I saw the whole 6 seasons 6 times and I remember almost all dialogues. Excellent story platform, brilliant actors and a ton load of money made this show the greatest show on earth. But time is the enemy that rust humans. I could see something was missing in the season 7. But in season 8, the show is completely Derailed from its course..
2	"When Jon in the last episode told tyrion : ""I'm sorry it came to this"" , i felt that. You felt that. We all felt that. Idk why i ended up giving 9 stars. Prolly because i fell in love with the show. Yes it was ruined at the end, but many of the episodes were THE BEST on TV. I was heartbroken after the finale but it is what it is. 9 stars for all the amazing actors and crew out there who played their hearts out. And the missing 1 star? Well earn it,D&D."
1	In my opinion this was not a comedy, especially so when I found out it was based off the main characters real life. It was pretty sad tbh, very raw and real. If this were me you couldn't have waterboarded this information out of me, but kudos to him for being brave enough to share his story! I guess it ended okay, the chick went to jail again & he didn't have to deal with her again which is good. But jeeeeeeesh everything leading up to that & the story of that period in his life was just flat out sad. I didn't laugh once lol just felt terrible for him. But seems he has come out the other end & making the best of it!
1	I'm a big fan of all the Patricia Highsmith's Ripley books and own all of them. Also, The Talented Mr. Ripley is still one of my favorite movies.So imagine my glee when I found this series on Netflix. Couldn't wait to see this new series but so far I'm disappointed. I don't mind it being shot in black and white. I don't mind the series starting in 1961 when the early Tom Ridley took place starting in early- mid 50's.It's borderline ridiculous to have an actor who's easily in his late.40's playing a 20 something Tom. Still,Both the book and original movie are wonderful! . This series so far is just meh.
1	"While I don't believe this series ever quite reached the heights of certain other medical dramas, its first several seasons were genuinely compelling and contained some truly heartfelt moments. Many of its characters and their respective storylines were enjoyable to watch, even if the writing left something to be desired on occasion. It was originally worthy of 7/10.Viewers should be aware, however, that this show rarely depicts medical proceedures accurately, and emphasis skews keenly toward the drama. For most of us, this was forgivable, at least until the majority of our favourite characters were either killed off or dismissed. Many of these instances could have been handled better. Nonetheless, I persisted.Then, characters and plotlines began to lean so far left they were practically having a stroke. Undertones were always there, but I took them merely as portrating different lifestyles, as there was enough sanity to keep things in perspective. Unfortunately, the balance shifted over time, until I was left either sighing or cringing at every episode.I bowed out at, ""Check your white privilege."""
1	I never played the game before but the first few episodes are a bit corny. I guess that's the point to make it seem like everything was all peaches and cream in the vault while real life was happening on the surface. Lucy is annoying and is green to everything lol which is expected since she has had a shelter life. Her life kind of reminds me of religion and Lucy is the preachers daughter. I'm a big fan of the ghoul for surviving this long and he's a bad ass gun slinger. Now the iron brotherhood with the foolishness of having a squire running and carrying weapons for a heavily armored knight is just asinine. This part just rubs me the wrong way actually but that's my takeaway from the first 3 episodes.
1	I have played most of the fallout games and really like the series. When I first heard about this I wasn't too sure how to feel about it. The film industry is famous for not keeping true to the source material or inserting their own agenda into the films.With that being said, I found the show to be better than expected but there are some areas I found lacking.Quality on production is great. However, there are several scenes throught the season where the film locations look just like other locations in different episodes. Also, many of the scenes make the wasteland feel small in comparison to the open world game.I also felt like the dialogue was weak in areas. Another annoyance was seeing characters both background and main characters both make terrible choices. Choices that are so bad they would have to intentionally make the bad choice because doing anything else would have been better. I dont want to give any spoilers but you will notice when you watch if you havent alreadyIt seems like several scenes that occurred only did so to drive story which didnt feel needed as the story was simple and straight forwardOverall if your a fan of the series or post apocalyptic genre fan or just looking for something light you may get enjoyment out of it. If your looking for a series more engaging with a better script and sensibility then you may want to look elsewhere.
2	What a stylish series. I just loved the use of classic noir styled direction in black & white filmography. It was edge-of-my-seat thrills but set at a very moderate pace. This is such a clever reincarnation of Mr Tom Ripley and beautifully acted by the very talented Andrew Scott, a brilliant choice. Every character in this series was wonderfully drawn, even the minor players were carefully placed - including the animals! The use of artwork and art references throughout just added so many layers to the storyline. In this time of instant gratification and rushing to the end - I found this so satisfying and refreshing. I'm a big fan of this series. Bellissimo.
0	For those who have read the book, the movie should be extraordinarily stupid. The action is largely respected, the characters do not respect the book's pattern. None of the characters respects the original description. Compared to the book, the movie is dull and boring. Compared to the 1980 screening, the present film seems lacking in vision, creating the impression of a low-budget film. The musket regiment was transformed into a cannon regiment. The weather in the film is always gloomy, even snow appears in some sequences, unlike the book where the weather is presented as clear and warm.The scene of the earthquake seems to be from another story. In the book died 140 samurai, in the film several thousand dead samurai are mentioned.The relationship between Anjin-san and Mariko-san is dry and lacking in involvement, unlike the original. The actor who plays Anjin-san doesn't even think he's read the book. The lines are dry and soulless. It seems that the screenwriter himself is included in the category of those who would not have read the book, the lines and sequences being represented as if he had heard the story from someone else and tried to improvise.
0	I wanted to like this show because Colin Farrell is an excellent actor and I love detective/noir films. Ferrel is good in this show but ALL, and I mean ALL, the other actors are terrible. There's not one supporting actor that gives a believable performance....except the dog. The dog shows a lot of appropriate emotions without over acting. I would definitely watch another show with this fabulous dog. His acting skills are comparable to Snoop from Anatomy of a Fall. They're both good boys!Back to the other supporting actors: I'm not sure if they're trying to be campy but they come off as cheesy sitcom actors from the 90s.I've seen the first two episodes but I'm not sure I'll watch the 3rd once it's released.
2	I am to episode 8 & think is a cracking series . Can you get it in book form
2	After 15 seasons and 2 episodes of the 16th. I can honestly say 'I am addicted'. Normally I get bored after a few seasons or even episodes but this show keeps my in my seat and depressed after the episode is over and have to wait a week or more for the next. So keep them coming!
2	So desperately needed some serious hard core Sci Fi and this deliveredFrom concept through to execution, just a materful piece of work.Brilliant narrative with twists I didn't see coming (I haven't read the book).Great cast with some outstanding performances.Well paced and believeable dialogue, which with solid performances leads to great characters.Good use of CGI but doesn't dominate the narrative or overshadow the characters.Great pace - glad to a sci fi series not suffering from Netflix disease (20 episodes stuffed full of filler) - keeping up the tension while still allows space for character development.So much going for this.Hope Season 2 lives up to the high expectations delivered by Season 1.Been hanging out for something this good since finishing The Expanse.
0	"Terrible writing. Was surprised to see Nathan Fillion was not one of the writers. It sure looks like a mid-life crisis.They are very good at creating annoying characters and leaving story lines mid way though. I went through most of the episodes to see if it gets any better. Not every story is as bad, but most of them are trash. According to them it only takes one ""lucky"", un-experienced, impulsive cop to solve all the cases. I think Nathan made it even harder to like it.I am not sure why it has this much good reviews. Either the Americans love their cop stories or they paid lot of people for good reviews."
1	Watching the first series which by all account is up there. And I find myself wishing I was watching reruns of House instead 🤷🏻 It's alright. But it's no House.
0	I'm glad there's a fast forward button on my video player. Series started out interesting and slipped into dull dross
2	I never read the books which means I watched this series without any bias. That said, this is by far the best sci-fi series I've seen in a looong time. Well developed characters, with depth and personality, excellent story/suspense/drama balance and great photography and cinematic effects. An excellent and diverse cast adds even more quality to the series. I highly recommend to anyone who loves sci-fi to watch this series with an open mind and be prepared to be surprised. It's not the classic flying ships and laser fights sci-fi series, it's something much better than that. Can't wait to see Season 2.
2	For some reason , I have never been a big fan of your lead actor . I can only put it down to his role in Sherlock , where , I now have to confess , I thought he was misscast and also too young to portray Sherlocks Arch Enemy but there is no doubt that he has remarkable presence . I wasn't terribly interested in yet another TV studio lacking any originality ripping of Movies ( as an Oldie ) but I have to confess that this is up there with the occasional unexpected gem in a field of dearth. At first I thought the black and white was being somewhat pretentious , given the genre has become somewhat over used ... but the CINEMATOGRAPHY was exquisite and worthy of any awards anywhere . Carravagghio would approve. HOPE THERE IS MORE TO COME (but I haven't read the books ) .... GIVE IT AT LEAST 3 EPISODES AND LET IT BUILD.
1	Despite its aesthetic allure, the series fails to captivate, leaving me yawning and on the brink of sleep through the initial trio of episodes. The addition of more female characters, a boost in action sequences, and a decrease in the prominence of fighting would undeniably enrich the viewing journey. I doubt I'll continue watching as the risk of nodding off looms large.While I understand it's an adaptation of a book, I fondly recall the 80s version, which managed to keep me engaged throughout. Thus, it seems entirely feasible for this adaptation to achieve a similar feat without missing out.
0	It was a great show until last seasons. It seems that Shonda transformed a great show in a lgbt propaganda. Too bad. I quit watching it.
0	"What's the deal with Grey's Anatomy? Why are the surgical ""interns"" not surgical ""residents"" after three years of training? Is this some kind of nightmare time-space loop that they're trapped in where they have to be subservient interns for the rest of their lives? Oh, and why is Dr. Bailey, the senior resident, not an attending already?Furthermore, why does this great Seattle hospital only have one neurosurgeon, one cardiothoracic surgeon, one OB/Gyn (who is somehow under the surgery department, not in her own department), one plastic surgeon (after being without any for the first two seasons), and, uh, that's about it. There are no internists, no oncologists, no gastroenterologists, no cardiologists, no psychiatrists, no pediatricians, etc....I think they're trying to freeze the soap opera element in time, to keep the show running as long as possible. Ridiculous. They should follow ""ER's"" lead and just let the interns/ resident's move through the program as they gradually introduce new cast members and get rid of old ones. The lack of realism in this show, plus everyone screwing everyone else, makes it more like ""General Hospital"" and less like ""ER"", ""House"" or even ""Scrubs."" Just move it to daytime already!"
0	"I stayed up late last night to finish the Netflix adaptation of The Three-Body Problem. The writers straightened out some minor plot bugs from the original novel, and the visuals were done well, but it still gave me a feeling of being as flat as cardboard.I thought about why, and suddenly realized that in the original novel there were many seemingly scattered plots that actually revolved around the singular event of the First Contact and its impact on people. Things like the motivations behind the Red Bank base, the betrayal of Bai Mulin, Yang Weining's death, the life in the northeastern village, the chant ""Buddha bless the Lord"", the different factions in ETO, etc. But this adaptation cut out all of those elements and added some cheap emotional subplots instead, making the first contact feel like meh, which completely defuses the power the original book."
0	I don't think they could have chosen a worse finale for a show that was so awesome for so many years. Recently I thought avengers endgame was poorly written but at least they made up for it with a good ending.
0	A really strong first and second season, downhill from there.Dolan's latest love interest, the one who seems to have any and every role from 'I wanna be a detective', fire marshall, camo wearing soldier and SWAT lead, is just dreadful and adds absolutely nothing to the show despite extensive screen time.Then there's Chen who, with eight hours training, is now the go to girl for deep and extremely dangerous undercover work.Such a shame, as there are some great characters and great performances, spoilt by poor storyline and unnecessary, secondary characters.Do better or please; just stop.
1	First of all, I haven't read the books, so my review will be about what I watched.That being said, the show tells us a story about humanity, how we interact, what we feel, the good, the bad, and how that can make us unique.I think the plot is amazing, there's no doubt about it, the effort to create an atmosphere of intrigue is notable, it catches you, I had no idea what was happening the first episodes and I think that was crucial, I loved that. However, when things start to make sense and It leaves you nothing to imagine it is weird, I dont know, what I love the most of a fiction sometimes is how nothing is clear, here they tell you everything, literally.Secondly, I think there were a lot of protagonists, they werent so bad, but too many stories that didnt have much to do with the plot (stop making fat people the funny ones)All in all, it was fun, it starts very good, then its not so good, then again good and then desapointing. If you love sci-fi, highly recommended, if not, watch something else.
0	Was once one of my favorites, But after first couple of episodes of the 3rd season and there woke/political references, Im done. T.V. Anymore is complete garbage!
0	Inspite of investing a fortune in the show, they could not adapt all the characters of the book. Last both the seasons felt extremely rushed. Trash show compared to books. But from show point it disappointed since s4.
1	I've enjoyed this show from the beginning. It has a good mix of story, comedy, characters. Acting is pretty good.However, I've been tempted to remove a star from my 7/10 rating since Jenna Dewan started as a series regular. Her Botox/plastic surgery face is so distracting! Every time she's on screen, I can't think of anything else. A shame.
1	Firstly, I've read the Remembrance of Earth's Past series by Liu Cixin and it one of my favourites. It's everything good Sci-fi should be.That being said, I don't mind a rewrite for a series. There are numerous fan fiction stories, one of which made it as the unofficial 4th book in the series.But what I find strange is that there are huge scenes that are following the book closely and the the others are dangerously close to trash.The main characters are not believable as top scientists. Some of it had to do with poor casting, a lot with the idiotic dialogue. These are top minds of the world and they speak like edgy 20 yos. They don't gratuitously swear.Apart from that, we also see the, now classic, strong female character trope (that replaces the man main character). That's fine, it doesn't matter, the story is much larger. But all the male characters are pathetic, useless, clumsy idiots that constantly need assistance. I whish Hollywood BS would have just stood this one out. This story not a good place for moral preaching.The CGI is sometimes amazing, sometimes cheap. The story is the same.I wish we could have had a slower story, with a smaller cast, more science and less teenage drama.
1	I started watching this Series quite late just because I want to watch it's prequel series so that I could understand it's background and how House of The Dragons story will link to its successor. After watching GOT one thing I have to say that I've not become a huge fan of it. This Series doesn't pleased me but I've to say and acknowledge that S01-S06 was a treat to its die hard fans because of the outstanding story telling, great plot and premise, Brilliant Writting and Pleasing Set Pieces but talking about the remaining two Seasons, S07 was Average with some flaws which is totally ignorable which makes all the 7 seasons worth watching this Series. But the S08 was a terrible Nightmare to the Loyal, Die hard fans of GOT because of the poor writing although Set Pieces and all the things are quite good but from the beginning of GOT it's story was it's backbone and it stood stand tall just because of it's Story. And the Writers and the Directors have totally ruined this epic series just because of a poor S08. I think HBO should Reboot it's S08 and give us a fresh S08 so that it can have a future so that GOT fans can vouch for it's next seasons maybe. I don't think that after delivering a worst S08 it has a future. I've lot to say about it but I would not get into it deeply I leave it to the Fate.
0	Season 1 and 2 were entertaining. Although the rookies get into over the top situations in every episode, every episode there is a shootout and they outplay the detectives.The third season was only about social justice, discrimination against minorities, female power, the 'old white man' as a problem, etc.This agenda is constantly pushed down your throat.Third season is hard to watch. That's sad, because I really liked the first two seasons, even though it was always a bit over the top. But it was funny and entertaining. I think I will stop watching after season 3, because season 4 seems to be even worse.4/10, because of the first two seasons.
2	Gonna be truly honest. This series is more than what I expected from it to be. Nathen acting at his best. TBH, really feels like a cop based show as it is made properly. Though it has some meeehh episodes. But still, it's worth a watch if anyone is interested in these kinda series.
0	This series offered so much at the beginning with wonderful trips taken by actors with the golden helmets. Great scenery and good acting allowed my mind to roam. The episode showing the ship going through the Panama Canal was excellent and so exciting. After this episode the series took a turn for the worse with grandiose plans being just too unrealistic. Having watched this long I wanted to see it through but it was all downhill from here. By the end of episode 6, I was bored by the dreary development of personal relationships. A very unsatisfactory ending resulted in my rating of 4. I wouldn't recommend.
1	So sad to see such a complex story transform into basic, uninspiring and irrational story full of plot holes with basic, one-dimensional characters. The whole point of the show and everything that we watched prior season 8 goes down the drain now. Valar morgulis, and so is GOT!
1	-2 Acting is sometimes great, but the contrast between the great acting and amateurs in this is a bit too much sometimes, especially with the Maximus character, his acting is pretty bad and his friend in training camp also bad, when they interact with the good actors it is jarring and sometimes I just need to skip ahead it is so bad and cringeworthy.-1 Direction is okay, not amazing. Some parts are 3 second shots 3 seconds shots, 3 second shots and it is TikTok monkey brain, some long shots are poorly done, flat feel like a green screen sci-fi channel. Pacing is a bit too slow sometimes, and a bit too fast at times.-1 for DEI and THE MESSAGE bs in this, how can you have a world of strong people at the top ranks of their military be a whiny femboy, makes no sense for the world. Also, making a lot of black characters positions of authority while the whites are just dumb idiots, of course.+1 for actual character development which is lacking in shows.Overall still feels a bit like a Sci-Fi channel show, and wish they follow the source material a bit more as in staying tru to the world. And please quit with the DEI bs, and know your audience.
2	Been looking forward to this show since first hearing of it, and with a title like The 3 Body Problem - relating to cosmology - the hook was in. So far I'm not disappointed, and thankfully no real attempt at shoehorned or overt DEI which is an instant joy killer for me. I'd say that if you're not the patient sort or not interested in science then this first episode could be a bit of a chore, however I loved everything about episode 1 and seeing some of the cast from GoT. On reflection, episode 1 was reminiscent of Sense8 - another incredible show - which also had a slow yet complicated opener. I'm about to start episode 2 and will alter my review after completing the show if necessary.
0	This was such a disappointment. Main characters are off-type and too old for the roles. The Ripley actor looks like a psychopath 24/7; there's no element of charm there, so tough to buy-in that he's getting away with anything or getting anything over anybody. The scenes are brutally slow and cumbersome - which to me means they didn't have enough content for the promised episodes. I don't mind the 'artsy' way they filmed this - though it seems a shame not to share the beauty Italy has to offer by shooting this with some color. I'm a Fanning fan - but this did her zero justice. She's very robotic and nuanced to death. The character Dickie was basically portrayed as being afraid of his own shadow, - which doesn't suit the story line at all. The whole thing was a colossal fail IMO.
1	A marvelous epic tale of super suspension of disbelief, having obvious qualities, semi-interesting entertainment & flow, overall good acting, but suffering, suffering and suffering from logic and thrill.8 episodes in and after nearly 8 hours, we know nothing about the aliens, besides CGI eyes and holographic artificial presence, are back to square one, praise bugs all over the world and have lots of work to do!Characters to get rid of in a possible season 2: Saul (soulless), Auggie (most of all - zero scientific personality), Da Shi if Benedict Wong doesn't improve his acting.Screenplay/storyline/plots: 6.5Production value/impact: 8.5Development: 8.5Realism: 6.5Entertainment: 5.5Acting: 7.5Filming/photography/cinematography: 8VFX/CGI: 8.5Music/score/sound: 7.5Depth: 7.5Logic: 2.5Flow: 5.5Adventure/drama/fantasy/sci-fi: 7Ending: 7.
0	When you think game of thrones will be the best tv series ever but they destroy it, so sad that i wasted my time & energy to be invested in this series. Major dissappointment
1	I really loved this show when I first watched it. I loved the intern concept and all of the hooking up. I loved the Derek Meredith story line. I liked the rare surgeries and the competitiveness of intern program. I liked the hooking up and the comedy.I hated when season two started and they made it seem like Derek cheated but it was Addison that cheated.The series really lost it for me several seasons in when Jackson and April fought every episode about their unborn baby. It was just too much. I don't watch reality shows because of the drama and don't like when shows aren't fun anymore.I hate shows when patients die all the time and they write scripts to purposely make people cry.I don't like how they kill everyone off, just write them out so people can have closure and have good memories of the characters and people could have hope they come back.How they killed Derek off was so stupid and I think it didn't do his character justice. He got in a car accident and they should have just let him die there but they wanted to push it out for drama sake. He was the best neurosurgeon in the country. And he was brought to a hospital in the middle of nowhere where the doctor that treated him was still learning, and didn't know she was doing. They mentioned that a CT scan could have saved him. I was so upset. And then his sister comes on the show and she is also a neurosurgeon. Like seriously!?I would stop watching the and my mom would tell me the new season was good so I would try again same thing, too much bad drama. The season when Meredith is about to lose her license for insurance fraud is a big plot hole. She and the other doctors who got the settlement from when people died in the plan crash bought the hospital . She could have done the treatments pro bono instead of committing insurance fraud. And they let her keep practicing because of testimony that she is a good doctor is so far fetched. They did pro bono surgeries all the time on the show.Wish someone would write a fun show without all the sad stories of people dying. Life is hard enough. TV should be juicy and fun.
0	"1. COLORS: Poor choice of colors and too many blurry out of focus misty background scenes. Even the indoor scenes were terrible. For some reason inside is a misty mess and background totally out of focus. Very unrealistic lighting and colors and very distracting.2. MUSIC: Just didn't go with the scenes. It was ........ I don't know what it was.3. SUBTITLES: Too many, too fast and too many unfamiliar names. My wife and I could not watch it together because both of us had to rewind at different times just to try and figure out what was going on. If you watch the actor's expressions you miss the subtitles and rewind, rewind, rewind.4. COMMERCIALS: I was going to join Hulu so I wouldn't have to watch commercials. Fortunately, I decided to watch it on FX first to see how I liked it. I won't be joining Hulu or for that matter I have no desire to watch another episode. Yes, too many distractions.5. ACTING: We were spoiled by Richard Chamberlain and John Rhys-Davies (actors in the 1980 much better version). Current actors don't even come close. Shame 6. STORY: I love the story, it is amazing. Unfortunately, there are too many distractions to enjoy the story.7. SCENERY: I lived and traveled all over Japan for three years. I don't know where this was filmed but for sure IT WAS NOT IN JAPAN......AT LEAST MOST OF IT. Maybe that is why a lot of the outdoor scenes were misty/hazy and out of focus.8. RATINGS: IMDB currently gives it a 9.3. It's only been out three days. Take a guess who gave it all those high ratings! I give it a ""one"" because of all the distractions.ALL I CAN SAY IS .......WHAT WAS THE DIRECTOR THINKING?????"
1	I was really really looking forward to seeing this NEW Shogun.It's got an amazing cast and a budget that anyone would die for but having watched this series up to episode 6 I'm maddeningly disappointed.The scenes skip from place to place making it difficult to follow the story line whereas in the original series/film the storyline was easier and made sense.I do like that there are subtitles in this series as there were none in the original BUT that was because Richard Chamberlain 'Pilot John Blackthorne' in the original series was made to learn Japanese making it closer to the original book (plus of course the author was on set helping with the script).I'm enjoying the series but anyone who's watched the original will be disappointed as I am given the writers of this series obviously haven't bothered to watch the original to see how the storyline works which is a shame.I look forward to seeing where this series goes and whether it can improve because in my mind the storyline is very difficult to follow unless you've watched the original or read the book by James Clavell written in 1975.
1	"First of all, i watched the 1st season, then i read all the books till season 2 came out and then i just watched the show since no new book (waiting for the 6th) came out.This was one of my favorite shows of all time, largely because the source material is great and this is not one of those Hollywood stories. People don't have ""plot armor"", main characters die and u get surprised when fan favorites get killed because the plot just makes more sense that way.A death is meaningful, GRRM always said that a good story has to do that. Another great aspect are fledged out characters who are not just black and white. For example Jaymie Lannister, first people think he is such a douche, but as the story progresses you see his inner motivation and that he is above all else a human being with a motivation like the rest of us (things i do for love)I was hopeful they would continue this show after the ran out of source material because some of the scenes which diverted from the book were really awesome (e.g. Arya and Tywin scenes in Harrenhal, in the books they don't meet but Arya interacts with R. Bolton at Harrenhal) - so i thought D&D could do good dialogue and some original writing.But boy ..... was i wrongI still enjoyed season 6 allthough some people already said it was showing that they ran out of book material, yes they did simplify a large chunk of the story but all in all, it was good writing and the scaling and logic of the universe still made sense aswell as the actions of the characters.But then season 7 came and they through logic out of the window, and i don't mean that in the sense that this is fantasy, but the ""logic of the universe"" was crushed. It felt like time travel and stupid decision making the whole season long. Season 8 so far turned this up a notch and made me cringe like every 5 minutes.What a sad ending for such a great start."
1	I had no issues recommending this series to anyone. And most thanked me for introducing the series to them. But after the ending... What's the point when it's not any longer a whole story. It used to be a multilayered story that you'd get engrossed in. But after season 8... Alot of the build up meant nothing... So watching 1-7 seasons seems like a waste of time.
0	Doesn't rely on books anymore. Became like a Hollywood movie. It is sad really. ~Emily
1	I was cautiously anticipating this show after hearing that the showrunners of game of thrones were making a Sci Fi show based off a book/series of books and I'm pleased to say I think this show is actually very good.The acting is great across the board and has a plot that gets you hooked very quickly, even with the first few episodes being slower than the later ones. Some of my favourite parts of the show take place in China in the 60s and 70s with a particular highlight being the closing montage of episode 2.There are definitely some moments of dodgy CGI however I never found it to be too distracting or a deal breaker because of how well they execute many crazy concepts on screen, especially in episode 5.The show never goes too in depth on science that would go over most people's head's which i imagine can be a good or bad thing depending on your taste and/or knowledge of the source material in which I have none.Overall I would recommend this show to fans of Sci Fi and a good mystery. This proves that the showrunners, David and Dan, are at their best figuring out adaptations as opposed to writing their own material, thankfully the source material has been completed unlike a song of ice and fire and there is also a third showrunner on board hopefully keeping things on track. Future seasons of this show are looking promising.
2	Ripley: A new take on Ripley is rendered in monochrome giving it a sinister tinge of Noir. Largely faithful to Patricia Highsmith's creation it does however make tings clear from the outset that Tom Ripley (Andrew Scott) is no innocent abroad as we see him dragging a body down a stairs observed by a cat, Luigio, who inadvertently (?) becomes Tom's accomplice. Fade to six months earlier in New York where Tom is running low level scams, living in a tenement. He is mistaken for a friend of the absent Dickie Greenleaf (Johnny Flynn) and is hired by Dickie's wealthy father to convince him to return home from Italy. Tom travels to Arani, outside of Naples where he visits Dickie, pretending to have met him previously. He enters the life of Greenleaf and his girlfriend Marge Sherwood (Dakota Fanning), both are aspiring artistes with little talent, Dickie a painter, Marge a writer, they do however possess the means to play out comfortable lifestyles. Marge is suspicious of Tom, thinking that he is a parasite, she is also jealous of his bromance with Dickie. A friend of Dickie, Freddie Miles (Eliot Sumner) also questions Ripley's motives. In the 1999 film The Talented Mr. Ripley, Tom was more motivated by wanting to fit in and his resulting violence was driven by jealousy. Here Ripley is more of a conman from the outset and while he does value Dickie's friendship he has always had his eye on Greenleaf's remittance cheques. His violence thus is more cold and calculating rather than impulsive or opportunistic. He always is prepared for violence though when there's a risk of his plans going awry. Scott is impressive as the sociopathic Ripley who is not a pathological liar, every untruth advances his agenda. Good performances from Flynn and Fanning but Sumner doesn't convince as Miles, a role in which Philip Seymour Hoffman excelled in the 1999 film. John Malkovich who played Ripley in Ripley's Game (2002) has a cameo as an art critic. The series was created, written and directed by Steven Zaillian. Eight episodes on Netflix. 9/10.
0	Haven't even finished it, way too dragged out. Theshow is also shot in such an infuriating manner with wayyy too many shots for no apparent reason. Framing is annoying in most scenes.Past this the writing is unbearable, really feels like and AI adapted the book to tv or something.Why are all the main characters so annoying and surprisingly boring. They're supposed to be genuis scientists but come off as immature losers. The only interesting character with some personality aside fron being boring was killed off way too soon.Overall just a boring waste of time. Basically the usual Netflix garbage.
1	"I really enjoyed this series. I've never played the games but I felt this was really good in establishing the world of Fallout and they made everything easy to understand. The acting across the board is really well done and the actors were all really well cast.My primary complaint about the series is two things: The first being there isn't a whole lot of character development. Our main characters Lucy, Maximus, and the Ghoul largely end the season on the dame footing where they began. The second being the insular characters are honestly more interesting than the main characters. The doctor is an interesting character whom we just abruptly lose. The radio DJ obsessed with string instruments is one and done. The tonic salesman/doctor ""scientist"" guy pops up and just as quickly disappears. These characters are just here to show how strange this world is, but honestly, they're so good that I found myself wanting more on them and less of the main characters."
1	I used to watch this show around a year ago and recently came back to it since I heard there was a new season going on.These new seasons were not like what I expected, seasons 1-12 are what I believe is the golden hour of this show and they just need to stop milking it.There were plenty of parts in the show where it was a perfect time to end it but they just keep on adding unnecessary plots, interns, etc.With a show that has been going on since 2005 you'd expect the new seasons would be good since audiences keep wanting more episodes but it just keeps on repeating the same storylines since season 1. If you are planning to watch this show, basically all it consists are a big important surgery goes wrong/well, couple is introduced and either breaks up or gets married, and a big character leaves the show. It's all repetitive plots that shouldn't last 400 episodes.
0	Final season would look like it was rushed, character development goes down the drain of few main characters. Somehow they stop following their own traits, for e.g Varys does everything in his hand to preserve the realm, seeing his character from past 7 season one can never think he just dies by giving hisaelf up like that. Same goes for Jaime Lannister, he was redeeming himself over the seasons and now he won't get his page in book of brothers filled with good stuff about him. Biggest disappointment was there was no background of Night King even in Season 8.
2	As an unashamed Nathan Fillion fan, I didnt hesitate to watch the first two episodes of this, while some of it is cliched, it still held my attention for the first two episodes and hopefully it will continue.Most of the characters are likeable and there is good is chemistry between some of them and a bit of drama thrown in to keep everyone interested. I loved Nathan Fillion in Castle and look forward to watching this show to see how it pans out.Hopefully it keeps to the high standard it has started with.
1	"Spoilers ahead!I don't know about you, but I like it when a series makes sense.And here's the thing, up until ep4 I think, right before the Villain's Macguffins start being explained, the series was pretty good. Solid entertainment. Really. But then the device by which the Aliens have been proving humanity are revealed and explained, the series just couldn't hold its good senses.We're talking about 2 super Ai computers that can fold to the size of a proton, and unfolded for just one of them to cover the entire planet. They can meddle with people's maind and make them see things. They can interrupt any electronic circuit, including autonomous cars, toasters, plain, watch, cellphone. You name it. They can make us see and hear whatever they want (they also made their earthling followers build a virtual reality set that hacks directly into the brain), but for some mysterious reason, they can't know what we're thinking.And so, the plot is as follows: These aliens will be arriving in 400 years, and so their plan is to mess with all of our scientific experiments so we don't get that advanced so that when they come, they will just conquer us easy peasy. We, brave humans, finally find out about their masterfull plan, get into action, dismantle the human network they've formed over the past 30 years here on earth... and so, they reveal themselves by making appear humongous creepy eyes in the sky.But we're fighters! And so we fight. We figure a way of kind of kick some dirt into the aliens plans by building a base on the moon. We organize and all. We're awesome. But here's the thing, with such powerful aliens devices here on earth at the aliens disposal, they could easily, waaaay easily plunder us into the most deep of the dark ages until they arrive. Before we knew abouot them, it made sense for them to walk in the shadows, now that the jig is up, it makes no sense to hold back. Just fry all of our electronics. Fry every promising human's brain. Make us see and hear things until we lose our minds, and then after 400 years, when you finally arrive at earth, you'll encounter no resistance. The endAnd that's the problem with creating such a powerful Macguffin. You can't write your way out of it. You should know better ""Co creators"" of Game of Thrones series."
1	I stopped watching The Rookie after I finished season 3 and just decided to get to it again. From what I remember, the show was pretty serious... Especially in season 1, which was the most realistic and grounded season. Season 2 got a little out there but had more action. And season 3 tried to balance some stuff out. (This was when real-life issues bled in the show more, and they had to do a little social commentary. I honestly thought the show handled the topics well enough.) I got back to watching The Rookie partly because I just watched the first two episodes of The Rookie: Feds and that was so campy-corny-bad. And what do you know, season 4 and 5 are exactly like The Rookie: Feds. The plotlines are so outlandish! It also started to have a whole lot more romance too, like wtf. It felt like an 80s soap opera. Actually, everything about The Rookie feels 80s, except for season 3, but still. Man, I guess it's still good to watch for some people? If you like crazy and GoT.Season 1 was an 8 for me. Season 2 and 3 were a 7. The new ones stay at 6. The direction of the show is not consistent at all, plus they have notable cast members leaving every season. The show is probably gonna get worse every new season until it's just so insane, you can't even comprehend it anymore. This is literally just a soap opera for Nathan Fillion fans. Honestly, might have accidentally sold myself on this show.
1	"On the plus side, the production was top notch with nice costumes and CGI.However, the crux of this series can be summed up with that old favorite phrase from the Seinfeld TV series, ""Yadda Yadda Yadda, Blah Blah Blah"". Not only is the dialog dull, inane, and mostly pointless; it goes on forever and ever, without taking you anywhere (admittedly it is occasionally interrupted by some interesting action sequences). By the tenth episode I was glad that it had ended.Other drawbacks are:The character of Blackthorne. I don't know if it was the actor, director, or script, but this character was dull, boorish, and obnoxious (and he always had this confused, dumb look on his face). This is not something you want in a protagonist.Mariko's character was uninteresting and boring. I did not even feel sad when she met her demise; my reaction was more ""Oh well"" (shrug)."
0	I loved and kinda still do love the show but the blm stuff and the wokeness killed it for me. I had to shut off the new episode and decide no more for me .
2	Powerfull season's from 1 to 7 then a huge disappointment in se8.
0	This is the biggest load of poo I have ever been forced to watch. Is the level scriptwriters have collapsed to. Writers have been terrible in recent years but has brought this to a new level of crap. Acting was mediocre. Story line well if it is true as stated at the beginning the characters, the real ones are mentally sick. Don't waste your time watch paint dry instead. The main character Donny is a lost soul mixed up between reality and his mental state. Unsure of what direction to follow but allowing others to guide an empty brain. A person who wants to be a comedian but has no idea as no connection to people or the real world.
1	A big start (maybe a 8 or 9), but go down and faster after the 3rd episode. The story was exactly like the spaceship for the final solution: accelerating after each episode but some wrong happens and the spaceship lost his direction to nowhere. Could be a slower storytelling with a better settlement. Will watch the 2nd season and rope that the series come back to another direction.Netflix put some of the dark palette of black mirror but I think the series need more colors, something different of the traditional formula and algorithmic of Netflix.The show runners could have more courage, trust in the story and be confident to run each episode with a lower velocity to give us time to absorb the content. Feeling I am watching the last season of GoT again.
0	So you take the vast imaginative world of fallout, you take whatever billions of dollars of budget, practically any actor or actress you want out there... and you come up with this? It's so bad it's shameful. Cardboard conversations, acting so dull it killed any interest I had and I forced myself to see through the edit of predictable scenes that is the first episode. If it wasnt for the sex and violence I would've thought that this was aimed at children. Fallout is cheesy and fun, this is like a sitcom with laugh track. Everything is so over explained, obvious, the cringe I get from thinking that someone put thought (barely), effort and money into this hurts me after a while of watching. Such a waste. 20 minutes of bad slow mo fight scene with cute music is not doing it for me anymore, not after seeing it for the 300th time. Nolan listed cliches in this series. And also, the main character, who did the casting? Someones intern nephew? I find it hard to believe that someone so bad at acting is the star of this show when there are so many talented people out there.
1	The real star of the show is the production design, which is spot on perfect and looks just like the game - it is what's holding the whole thing together. Walton Goggins is another stand out as the Ghoul; he is the real protagonist if you ask me. The other 2 main characters aren't really that engaging and feel more tacked on to get the plot moving, especially Maximus, who only seems to be there to justify having the Brotherhood in there at all.They try to cram so many things into these 8 episodes that it's hard to get attached to anything other than the guy who is present in nearly all of it. The writing is okay at best and veers into Marvel-esque dialogue at worst. The direction is mostly quite flat and boring, but the story picks up towards the end with a few reveals that will have an interesting effect on the next game should they remember it 15 years down the road.All in all, it's not bad but there's a lot of wasted potential. I'm still interested to see where they take it with the second season, which is bound to be greenlit.
0	This show is so cruel, it drags you into it's grasps, makes you fall in love with it, and then stomps you to shreds.
0	"I love the books.This show - sadly not at all.The un-necessary & wrong decision in the change of the character-setting is just ridiculous. Splitting the main character(s) of the books up into a diverse UK-ish circle of friends (with partly bad actors and partly unlikable characters) is turning the exceptional and credible story-line of the books into a cheap implausible soap opera.What remains is in the end simply riding on the massive wave of the excellent books. Anytime the producers decide to go off-track of the original story with their own ""ideas"", the show declines massively.In short: The (tragically known) producers did it again. Turning another person's outstanding story with wrong decisions and a big budget into a mediocre trivial TV show."
2	Not sure where all these 10's are coming from, Shogun is excellent television for sure, but the obvious heavy handed CGI takes me right out of the narrative a lot of time, and it's a shame. But such is big budget scifi and historical pieces these days. I don't remember seeing the previous iteration on television back in the 80's I think, but this one's got all the right ingredients, and I'm also not sure how faithful it is to the original source material. Seems like it's a blockbuster breakout hit which can only be a positive, but I'd rather see more practical sets and less CGI is all I'm saying.
0	"It's sad when a really great show ""jumps the shark"" as they say. It was over after Cristina left. She was really the main character, not Meredith. But the show really hasn't been good since Lexi and Mark died. During these unpredictable times, I really long for the warmth and friendship of the original gang. When the characters had spunk and ambition. And even though the storylines were often dark, the writers managed to lighten the mood with personal relationships and banter. The show has now adopted some sort of moral theme. When will writers realize that what make the characters and storylines so relatable, is the imperfections. That's why network TV is failing and foreign streaming shows are taking over. I haven't watched since mid-way though the Covid season. It was too boring to finish."
0	Show used to be a great show. Now it's just the same over and over and over again. Either come up with more interesting and intriguing episodes or end it. They are predictable and boring.
0	As the title said. This is the worse adaption ever. It doesn't even stay true to the source material. At no point in this series did the main character clip into the ground and fall out of the map. There was also a severe lack of Macho Man Randy Savage and Thomas the Tank Engine deathclaws in this series. How can you be authentic to Fallout without delivering the classic Bethesda jank that makes Fallout great in the first place? Bethesda's philosophy is nowhere to be seen in this entire series. When one thinks Bethesda, one thinks of a half baked unfinished product, and that is fine. You know why? Because the fans will fix it anyway. It just works.
2	This epic drama series starts out slow and unassuming, but this storyline gets more and more intense, slowly but steadily towards the riveting, visceral, intense and dramatic end. So have some patience at the start, your patience will be rewarded...The good: the actors (and characters) in this story are really impressive (unlike many other tv series) and even the supporting actors are good (which is a rarity), with great actor's chemistry between the leading actors. What incredible delight to watch!More good: this storyline is really intrigueing, although it starts out quite slow and unassuming, this story spirals into a feast of honor and survival, with the most wicked and dramatic and heroic plot turns that leaves me behind breathing for some relief...Even more good: this series looks and sounds the part. With beautiful costumes and sets and eyedropping gorgeous photography. What beauty.This is the sort of quality one only usually gets to see in masterfully made feature movie classics.Beware: you might be misled by the trailer, which shows lots of action sequences, but besides several stylish, yet quite bloody, short samourai fighting scenes, this movie is firstmost (for some 80%) an ACTOR's movie with TERRIFIC dialogues and lots of suspenseful INTRIGUES. Probably best suited for an audience who appreciates the finer period acting dramas is my (lucky) guess...One of the very few tv series that make me watch the end credits of EVERY episode till the very last credit line and the last piece of soundsore. What blissful mastery!Bravo!
1	On the lookout for a proper realistic cop series, stumbled on this.Characters showed promise but as the series unfolds everything boils down to 'love', loneliness, stupidity.Unseemly conduct by hardened police officers, who Are more interested in falling in love or getting over troubled childhood or dealing with normal life issues.The prisoners are smarter, drug dealers are better at strategic planning.Women officers trying to act macho or simpering or plain juvenile.Sometimes I wonder if they churn out series without any understanding of what the audience is looking out for.Token LGBTQ characters, with weak characters are we so gullible?
0	I am in season 5 but looks very hard to carry on further. Series started fine but I never saw any title character so clueless. Everyone around Grey has performed well but she doesn't know how to act. Everyone is sleeping around with everyone. Many characters don't work only gossip and stupid drama. Very less medical talks. Unwanted twists and turns.Could have been much better with this star cast. Many unwanted scenarios, ghosts, forced LGBT.Many situations just dragged a bit too long.This is more personal than professional drama.Weakest link is Meridith grey. Pathetic acting and confused.
1	I liked this show I liked the acting and storytelling the only thing I disliked was the medicore ending its so abrupt and unsatisfying it leaves you saying wait thats it so there's no resolution whatsoever we see blackthorn a frail old man in bed so we know he got out of Japan but honestly not seeing the battle between the 2 armies was a let down I think they didn't show it because they ran out of money honestly the ending makes watching this a waste of time hollywood doesn't have a clue how to end a series proper I mean the way it was told that this would be ishidos fate was so flat and uninteresting I would not recommend you watch this.
1	You will great storytelling till season 4 and you will not able to predict what's coming after that it's okayish but season 8 ruined everything
0	"I've not read the books, just watched the original Chinese show.It's impossible to turn a series of books into a 30 episode TV series without leaving a lot of the body and spirit by the wayside.The Chinese series is hardly perfect - plot holes, ridiculous characters (mostly ""foreigners""), vague explanations, lucky ""coincidences"", and more. But it does provide the viewer one thing at least - time. Time to get to know the main characters, their history and culture, time to think, time to form ideas and criticism, time to breathe.When the american production decided to ""slim it down"" to 8 (eight!!) episodes, it took away that time.What remained is reminiscent of the dessicated bodies of the Trisolarans, when chaotic times hit them.The americans try to re-hydrate the dry storyline with the only tactics they know - comic-relief characters, love interests, lively banter, commercialization, gratuitous violence. Some say they have ""dumbed it down"" for the american audience, but I believe they are just robbing those who are open to explore different types of storytelling than the ones they are force-fed every day.I enjoyed the Chinese series, despite its shortcomings. I cannot really find any redeeming qualities in the american version."
2	This have a shadow of END OF WATCH & a pinch of ROOKIE BLUE to it. Intense yet sensitive when it needs to. If made right it should be a solid five season series. Compared to this castle was just a melodrama to say the least.
0	I was trying to hang in there to the final episode but I can't even watch it anymore. It sucks!
1	I hope the whole season isn't entirely COVID. Also, PLEASE get rid of DeLuca...soon. Hard to believe the Meredith character is supposed to be a strong & independent character & yet she hooked up with a much younger intern with serious emotional issues. What kind of character would expose her children to that? To be honest, for the past few seasons I just want to slap these annoying characters.
1	"...is that TWO of the 5 Bodies can't stay awake through ""3 Body Problem"".The show has some potential, but it keeps getting way too bogged down in the personal dramas surrounding the younger characters; spending entire episodes crying on a beach or in a bar.Three saving graces are. Liam Cunningham (""Davos"" from Game of Thrones""), Rosalind Chao (""Keiko O'Brien"" from ""Star Trek!"") and. Benedict Wong (""Wong"" from the MCU). They are able to ground this series and seem to be the three characters who keep the pace moving forward. Nothing is wasted when they are on screen. Sadly, there was a 4th actor, John Bradley (another GoT alum, ""Samwell Tarly""), but they killed off his character early on.Now that, two episodes out from the season finale, the pace has slowed to a glaciers pace, we're just rolling our eyes hoping to just get through it."
1	For those that have never played the game, the basic premise is that the protagonist starts in an underground fallout shelter called a vault, and through various circumstances is forced to the surface in a struggle to survive.This show gets that part right, but it's via a poorly written story that has no coherent thought process behind it. Sure, there's a general plot that is followed in each episode. Unfortunately, the writers don't seem to want to actually tell a good story, they just want to set up individual scenes that are loosely tied together... and don't even get me started on the plethora of plot holes and inconsistencies.On a positive note, the show does a good enough job of capturing the look and feel of the Fallout world. However, it does not seem to populate that world with all of the enemies and monsters that you would find in the game. It gives you a few ghouls and radroaches here and there, but the actual Fallout world is teeming with these, as well as an abundance of other nasties to be dealt with.Overall, I was very disappointed with this because, as the title says, I expected greatness and I got mediocrity.
0	The show starts with potential, then falls off a cliff rapidly, which is subsequently sent down a long, long hill. Actors do a good job with their material, however, most come off very unlikable. The action is serviceable, however it has apparent, obvious nitpicks that you could dissect. Logic of both action and downtime feels very floaty and seems wildly inconsistent scene to scene. Dialogue is passable however seems intent on out of place comedy. Instead of a comedy, it would have serviced better as a thoughtful tale instead of trying to appeal to an out of touch funny wonderland. It's connection to the games seems to be an unfortunate attachment that forces it to an awkward compromise, though it should have been disconnected for both fans and non-fans alike so it could spread wings better. Even for non-fans, there's glaring issues with it's continuity and logic, complete with unremarkable inconsistent problems with the overall story.
2	This captures so much that I expected from a Fallout show. The set design, costumes, make-up, storylines, NPC's all bring this show to life. So engaging, wonderful twists and turns, and it felt like you were behind the wheel, taking in the choices and seeing how our heroine Lucy decided to lead her path. It was incredible to watch a show that had to have been the cost of a full length cinematic film. The sheer amount of details they weaved told the story so well, but left a ton of Easter eggs for the die hard gamers to enjoy. Rock solid casting from the main characters to the one-offs. I had a blast watching it, and I cannot wait for another season.
0	Game of Thrones used to be a show about how the petty squabbles of humanity were a threat to it's very existence. The fight for the throne has always been about personal distractions being placed over what we all know was the real danger: the white walkers. Winter came, as we were promised from the very first scene of the very first episode. And what was the point? So the Night King could die via Deus Ex Machin-Aria and we can spend the last three episodes watching the remaining characters (you know, the plot armor army) deal with a drunk pregnant lady and a generic crazy guy. The episode was pretty enough, when you could see anything. Strategy was so bad they honestly all deserved to die for how freaking disorganized everyone was. Music was the one saving grace, and Theon and Lyanna were both satisfying deaths, at least. Aside from that...Game of Thrones, what happened to you?
0	Season 7 was Bad. Season 8 was Terrible. Script writing for season 8 was just horrible. I couldn't believe that the same leading characters from first 6 seasons would do that nonsense. I think GOT creators didn't even try to do their Job properly.
1	Really nails the games! The costume is spot on, in that it also embraces being over the top in that fallout/rockstar humor. It is cool seeing the games like this and the guy who plays the ghoul he is just a perfect creep and crack up. Im really sorry if he is a great person in real life cause I believe every sleazy thing this guy does.Why the meager rating? The plain Jane boring writing. No chara yer development forever. It seems they chose to make the characters just like atrociously stupid and it's honestly hard to watch. They just do the dumbest things to b le in distress constantly. I don't know why that is necessary considering that they are living in a nuclear wasteland! The story is delivered at a snails pace. We are shoveled endless gore for gores sake. I think that is a mistake. We have had few years of relentlessly realistic gore in high budget works produced by Netflix and all that apple exclusive stuff. I'm tired of it. It's overused and how distracts and detracts from the story. It once sold how extreme something was now it's like tattoos. More than half of people have them on their face and they look like a bunch of sheep following the herd. It's no longer rebellious and edgy! All those girls grew up, didn't leave the trailer, had kids and took them to get these tattoos on their 12th bday lmao. Anyways back to the review because it seems I have not made the dear and all inclusive six hundred American English characters limit! I must be mistaken right?The show is entertaining, especially, if you like the games. I couldn't finish them and this slow delivers on interesting story so slowly after it starts with a bang. Like I thought it was going to go right in and now I'm like a baby along with the girl because she is just so naive that none of these experiences are changing her? And nobody can talk, like a superhero movie all is just fists to drive the bad writing, and then some deus ex machina to further save bad writing. Everybody is very convenient in the path they wonder after the last CGI attack lol.
0	I must be going insane because I literally cannot fathom how this show has gotten anything over 5/10 by any reputable critic.The first episode was somewhat engaging, but towards the end and pretty much everything after that began to feel like I was watching an amateur theatre youth group's attempt at a video game parody. The acting is absolutely atrocious from pretty much every character. The plot is uninteresting, the CGI is terrible and the pacing is all over the place.I really hope some people with brains start watching this so the reviews start to match its actual quality, because I wasted 2 hours of my life on this thanks to the ratings it received.As a long-time fan of the Fallout series, I'm really disappointed that they couldn't find more than one competent actor for the show.
2	There are only two programs I won't miss on TV, and Grey's is one of them.Why? Because I watch TV to escape from the real world! Since the pilot, I've been hooked - the characters are engaging, and I find them quite true-to-life in that there are times when I love them, and times when I don't. Even George bugs me occasionally (the boy's a born doormat), and Bailey is a DIVA. The plots aren't too heavy, the acting's great, and I enjoy the soundtrack.I agree with some of the comments, especially about the title character being far too introspective and prone to fits of existential moping, but you can't have everything! I watch the show religiously because it takes me away from where I am, and I can lose myself in their lives for an hour. I cheered when Izzie FINALLY got it on with Alex, I shouted at the TV last night when George kissed Meredith -seriously, it will end in heartbreak - and the whole Burke and Cristina relationship is wonderfully played. Yes, if I was injured, I wouldn't want to go to their hospital to get fixed, they'd probably be in a cupboard having sex, but as TV it's first rate.
1	After the departure of Sandra Oh of the series, Grey's lost its quality. It's a bad series, nothing interesting happens. I love Ellen and the rest of the cast, but they must finish the show, it does not make sense anymore. 9 only for seasons 1 to 10.
1	The TV series is OK but mostly fiction. Some episodes are over dramatized. In particular episode 8 where Nolan kills a criminal in self-defense. Nolan is emotionally not suited to be a cop in LA, maybe in a small rural town where everybody is nice.
1	Don't know what I thought of that ending before but is this really the last season? I've been following Grey's forever.
1	This series has been exceptional through its first six seasons. I used to recommend the show to people that haven't watched it. Now after season 8, I steer people away from watching the show.Anyone will love the first six seasons, but it isn't worth the heartbreak you will experience after watching the final two seasons. You spend all this time talking about the show, the characters, the subplots, speculating the ending. But what you get is bad dialogues, plot holes, unsatisfactory story, an epic battle that you literally can't see, some complicated characters becoming bots, some heroes just fading into the background, some heroes turning villains unnecessarily and of course the worst possible ending.Don't believe the critics and people that say they liked the ending. What they are encouraging is mediocrity. If I have to say few things that keep the final two seasons above water, they are, the music, the production sets and the actors.Netflix executives that hired David & Dan for $250 million, really? You spent that much money on mediocrity?I don't recommend anyone watch this series because the payoff isn't worth it.
1	"I was really looking forward to this series, being a fan of the books and the '99 film. I tried very hard while watching to not compare it to that film, and had to keep reminding myself to not do so. Almost an exercise in futility considering how superior that film is to this. Even if I hadn't ever seen the film, I'd still feel the same about this series. So I let a day go by before writing my review but I still haven't changed my opinion. This series does follow the book more closely than the last film did.Unlike what other reviews have said, I didn't mind the black and white. Other than it makes an incredibly vibrant country like Italy look drab. Even in winter, which is the season it's set in, Italy is full of life. According to the series there's only about ten people who live in whole country because you don't really see anyone other than these characters. The cinematography is beautiful and definitely the best thing about this series. But I have to think if it had been in color it might have helped this slow and downright dull series pack a little punch. It gives Italy and its gorgeous coast, cities and life the bland flavor of what a post war eastern block communist country is depicted in other films. There is also a very strong art house vein, with far too many and too long shots of stairs, alleys and streets.Dakota Fanning who I really like, and was excited to see in something new was the best in this film of the three main characters. And this was far from her best work, though the last episodes she does give a little more. She's not bad at all, but there's no emotion. She has no chemistry with the actor who plays Dickey, who in turn has no chemistry with the actor who plays Tom. The acting overall isn't bad it's just not giving much of anything. I've also seen complaints about Freddie being played by a woman or non binary (I've read both in the review and I'm not sure which is correct nomenclature for the actor, I'll just say she) but frankly she gives the best performance because she has some feeling. Not just flat affects and performance like the rest. The best scenes are with the police inspector, which have a little tension but could have really had more. The inspector is my favorite character of all of them, he at least gives some performance. They try to have a cat and mouse conflict but it just doesn't quite happen. Leaving me with no care of who dies or not and if anyone is caught or not.Dickey and Tom are supposed to have real chemistry that leads Tom to believe that Dickie has feelings for him. Tom is supposed to be a master at impersonating people to con people. None of these are believably pulled off in this or even attempted. There are even unexplained plot holes that demand you have some knowledge of the book or you'd be totally lost. That's if you even make it far because it is very slow. Slow isn't a dealbreaker for me if there's pay off and this lacks much. When a murder scene is boring then there is a problem.I can only guess that the European art house style is what they were purposefully trying to portray. The dry dialogue even in what should be emotional moments, black and white with too long shots of stairs for no reason, exaggerated ""I'm bored"" style of acting. Which doesn't help when the plot and acting is plugging along monotonously. It does pick up in the last two episodes. Sometimes a film tries too hard to be avant-gard and it just doesn't work. Had it been a 90-180 min movie it would've been better but a series needs to keep you captivated to want to watch not just to see if something happens. Anyone who rated this over a 6 has either not seen the '99 movie or trying to seem like a high brow art film buff, but they're way off. So I was disappointed, and will go watch the Talented Mr Ripely to cleanse my brain and give it the gorgeous Italian feel and burning tension it's screaming for."
2	"Very good show.ABC is the best company currently broadcasting. No one is better.Funny how the self-declared ""Christian values"" station is the only one aside from its partner in wedded bliss, ABC Family, that produces shows centered around WOMEN and dedicated to the growth of all. Props to this show for being real about trying to explore grief and PTSD.I really hate Christina and Owen. I'm kind of surprised that anybody likes them together. He seems to be using her, and their 'I'll be with you even when you're an asshole because I feel sorry for you' mutually codependent caretaking thing is irritating.Every single woman on this show seems involved with a man who is her boss or is ranked higher than she is at her workplace. This is not healthy behavior, nor it is something y'all ought to be encouraging.Little Grey and Mark Sloan dating is a little bit disturbing--there is such a thing as too much of an age difference to be able to work things out. I'm not sure if y'all are trying to be sexist or just inadvertently going there, but c'mon. Three supersmart women are dating older, more highly ranked men? Eew.Things not dealt with satisfyingly on the show however include--Meredith's Mom's death, Addison's departure and the how and why of it, Rebecca's life and disappearance from the show, Mark's feelings for Addison, Meredith's suicidality: fact or fiction, and George's death.The list is growing.Y'all--substituting briefly adrenaline-pumping events is not sufficient replacement for actually watching characters grasp and deal with new events in their lives and painful goodbyes.That used to be what made this drama great, was its capacity to witness the human element of drama as a slow but steady process. The show used to be better at dealing with real pain, not pain obviously manufactured to attract viewers to the season finale.When people stop watching your show, work on making it better, don't insert bizarre random dramatic events in hopes of attracting former viewers scared of watching their favorite characters die.That is LOW, and may get you what you want for a short while, but it will also ensure you go to the dark and scary place...which is fitting, because the writers appear unwilling and unable to deal with anything remotely dark OR scary since Izzy's tumor, if not before.My personal thoughts, but c'mon. Y'all are better than this. By y'all I mean the writers, actors and actresses you are wonderful as ever. Writers, get your mojo back. These folks deserve scripts that kick ass, not linger incessantly on stuff no one really cares about anyway while cutting out all the truly good stuff.Make it a feminist show again, not merely a show about women."
0	"If you're inclined to race and gender swap to appease certain brain dead audiences, at least attempt to write, direct and cast actors who can carry the part of their professions. This formula driven adaption of Liu Cixin trilogy is almost laughable how bad the characters are. For example, Eiza González who plays Auggie Salazar acts and behaves more like a depressed office receptionist than a ""brilliant' scientist. Jovan Adepo who plays the brilliant Saul Durand speaks and acts more like a 10th grade burned out chemistry teacher who part times as a assistant coach than a brilliant scientist. The writing and direction has that a CW vibe . This show would be a perfect pairing on the CW after Nancy Drew or Riverdale."
2	If you are going to remake a classic mini series , this is the was to do it. I won't go into the plot of the series but just to say I am so far very impressed at how these first 2 episodes have panned out. The original 1980's series was very impressive for its time and Is worth checking out if you haven't seen it.But this remake has so far proved to be superior in scope and attention to detail and script. The acting and characterisation is sublime.Obviously a lot of research has gone into the production and the casting of the main characters. I would recommend anyone interested in this period of history to check it out.
